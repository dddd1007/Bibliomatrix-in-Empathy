Abstract = {{The concept of emotional intelligence (EI), a model that encompasses all
   of the skills in the patient-doctor relationship, has been applied to
   medical education in recent years. Doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology
   (O\&G) often deal with emotionally demanding situations for themselves
   and for their patients, and therefore, EI skills may be vital and should
   be part of any training curriculum. Using novel methodology, 16 O\&G
   consultants from across the North-West of England were asked to
   investigate (using a coding manual) randomly allocated modules of the
   RCOG O\&G training curriculum, to look for constructs of EI and these
   were found both implicitly and explicitly, highlighting the importance
   of EI to O\&G. By focussing on EI training within the curriculum, to
   improve the patient-doctor relationship, patient satisfaction may be
   increased and litigation reduced in a specialty that is already highly
   litigious.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Little is known about the frequency and occurrence of
   patients' negative emotional cues and concerns (NECC) across specialties
   in hospital departments.
   Methods: Ninety-six consultations were videotaped in a general hospital.
   The VR-CoDES (Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences) were
   used to code the patients' NECC. Cohen's kappa was used to establish
   reliability between coders.
   Results: Cohen's kappa was above 0.60. NECC were observed in more than
   half of the consultations. The number of NECC in the consultations was
   163, with 109 negative emotional cues and 54 concerns. The mean number
   of NECC in the consultations was 1.69, with a median of 1. The first
   NECC in consultations were stated after a median duration of 5 min 21 s.
   We could not find significant differences related to the gender and age
   of the patient or the physician, or the specialty of the physician.
   Conclusions: More than half of the concerns were not preceded by a
   negative emotional cue. Few consultations contained more than 3 NECC,
   and NECC tended to be expressed relatively early. Practice implications:
   Patients' expressions of emotional issues are few, and most of them are
   subtle. Physicians should be thoroughly trained to identify and respond
   to them. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is a substantial body of research on inter-human empathy
   and inter-animal empathy, there is a dearth of research competing
   humans' empathic reactions to humans and animals. To address this issue,
   three experiments were conducted in which participants read a scenario
   about a human or animal abuse victim in need of medical attention, and
   indicated the degree of empathy they had on an emotional response scale.
   In Experiment 1, women had significantly more empathy for animals than
   for humans, whereas men tended to express more empathy for humans than
   for animals. In Experiment 2, adult women expressed the same degree of
   empathy for a child as for a puppy. Similarly, in Experiment 3, adult
   men and women expressed the same degree of empathy for a baby as for a
   puppy. Overall, results indicated that people feel at least as much
   empathy for animals as for humans. We suggest that an animal target
   elicits a great deal of empathy partly because it is perceived as not
   being responsible for having caused the need situation. Future research
   will show whether empathy for animals translates to prosocial behavior
   toward them as well.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effects and challenges of being a
   simulated patient (SP) in a high-stakes clinical examination context in
   a regional setting.
   Design: Mixed methods, using a written survey, focus groups, and a
   retrospective postal survey.
   Setting: A university clinical school in a Victorian regional city.
   Participants: Nineteen SP volunteers (from an existing database of 55
   people) who had been involved in midyear, summative Objective Structured
   Clinical Examination (OSCE) role-play performances.
   Main outcome measures: Challenges of the OSCE roleplay experience and
   the reported effects on SPs. The implications of these factors have an
   impact on the sustainability of SP programs in regional settings.
   Results: Physical and emotional effects like exhaustion were reported,
   as well as empathy and concern for the medical students. The
   retrospective postal survey indicated that the SPs had no long-term
   negative effects from their high-stakes examination experiences.
   Participants also reported that a level of decision making and
   improvisation was needed in the performance of their OSCE role plays.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals the complexity and demands on SPs in
   performing in high-stakes clinical examinations. The results highlight
   that SP roles involve more than the transfer of scripted information.
   SPs should be considered as members of the examination team when
   preparing and implementing high-stakes examinations to assist in
   maintaining standardised performance during and across OSCE role plays.
   Relationships between SPs and educational institutes need to be nurtured
   to ensure that the ability to continue highstakes OSCEs in a regional
   setting is maintained.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{421-426}},

Abstract = {{Pain is prevalent in clinical settings, and yet it is relatively
   under-represented in the education of most students in the health
   professions. Because pain includes both sensory-discriminative and
   affective features, teaching students about pain presents unique
   challenges and opportunities. The present article describes the
   evolution of a new blueprint for clinical excellence that, among other
   competencies, incorporates a need for the emotional development of
   clinical trainees. The framework has been applied to the development and
   implementation of two new courses in pain. The first course is designed
   to provide a comprehensive foundation of medical knowledge regarding
   pain, while integratively introducing students to the affective
   dimensions of pain. The second course is designed to enhance students'
   appreciation for the protean effects of pain through use of the
   humanities to represent medical experience. It is concluded that, to be
   most effective, fostering the emotional development of trainees in the
   health professions necessitates the incorporation of affect-focused
   learning objectives, educational tasks and assessment methods.}},

   concerns (intervention group; N=24) or were shown an educational video
   about schizophrenia treatment before an appointment for routine
   follow-up care (control group; N=26). The visits were recorded and
   analyzed by using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Results: Visits
   by patients in the intervention group were longer (24 versus 19 minutes,
   p<.05) and had a proportionately greater patient contribution to the
   dialogue (288 versus 229 statements, p<.05) and a smaller ratio of
   clinician to patient talk (1.1 versus 1.4, p<.05) compared with visits
   by the control group. Patients in the intervention group asked more
   questions about treatment (2 versus .9, p<.05), disclosed more lifestyle
   information (76 versus 53 statements, p<.005), and more often checked
   that they understood information (3.6 versus 2.1 checks, p<.05).
   Clinicians asked more questions about treatment (7.5 versus 5.1, p<.05)
   and the medical condition (7.8 versus 4.7, p<.05) to control group
   patients but made more statements of empathy (1.3 versus .4, p<.03) and
   cues of interest (48 versus 22, p<.05) with the intervention group. The
   patient-centeredness ratio was greater for visits by patients in the
   intervention group than by the control group (8.5 versus 3.2, p<.05).
   Patients' tone was more dominant and respectful (p<.05) and clinicians'
   tone was more sympathetic (p<.05) during visits by patients in the
   intervention. Conclusions: The Web-based tool empowered persons with
   schizophrenia to engage more fully in a patient-centered dialogue about

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In the primary care setting, use of the BATHE (Background,
   Affect, Trouble, Handling, and Empathy) method of interviewing has been
   shown to increase patient satisfaction. This technique is a brief
   psychotherapeutic method used to address patients' physical and
   psychosocial problems. The BATHE technique has not been evaluated in the
   perioperative setting as a way of improving patient satisfaction. In
   this study, we sought to determine whether satisfaction could be
   enhanced by use of the BATHE technique during the preoperative
   evaluation by anesthesiologists.
   METHODS: Fifty cardiac and 50 general surgery patients were interviewed
   in the preanesthesia clinic (PAC) of an academic hospital. They were
   randomly enrolled in the BATHE group or the control group and asked to
   complete an anonymous satisfaction survey after their visit. This survey
   was modified from current studies and not validated elsewhere. The
   relative influence of the BATHE condition was examined as it pertained
   to interview duration, patient satisfaction, and patient report of the
   BATHE items being asked.
   RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of patients approached by the study group
   voluntarily enrolled. Patients interviewed using the BATHE method
   reported being asked about all BATHE questions significantly more often
   than control patients: t(98) = 19.10, P = 0.001 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 2.59, 3.20). Patients in the BATHE group were more
   satisfied with their visit to the PAC than those in the control group:
   t(98) = 5.37, P = 0.001 (95\% CI = 0.19, 0.41). The use of the BATHE
   method did not significantly increase the amount of time physicians
   spent evaluating patients: t(98) = 0.110, P = 0.912 (95\% CI = -1.519,
   1.359).
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of the BATHE method in an academic medical center's
   cardiac and general PAC showed promising results in this preliminary
   study. A validated and fully developed survey instrument is needed
   before we can convincingly conclude that the BATHE method is an
   effective way of improving patient satisfaction. (Anesth Analg

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The study of narrative has become increasingly important in the
   humanities and social sciences and there is a growing use of narrative
   in the clinical domains of medicine and psychotherapy. Narrative
   psychiatry is also on the rise and promises to help psychiatry be
   responsive to increasing critical concerns from inside and outside the
   field.
   Recent findings
   The field of narrative is vast and cuts across a variety of disciplines.
   Contemporary scholars in narrative medicine build on 30 years of work in
   medical humanities and bioethics to rigorously understand human
   variables in medicine and to improve physician empathy. Narrative
   psychotherapists have developed a new model of psychotherapy and a
   meta-narrative theory of diverse mental health interventions.
   Psychiatrists have picked up these insights and are finding them
   invaluable for navigating contemporary issues in psychiatry.
   Summary Narrative theory has become important in the humanities, social
   sciences, medicine, and psychotherapy for understanding human meaning
   making. Increasingly, the tools of narrative are proving valuable for
   psychiatry as well. Narrative psychiatry does not negate or supersede
   other knowledge and research in psychiatry, but it can help psychiatry
   understand how people use psychiatric knowledge, among other cultural
   resources, for making sense of psychic difficulties and psychic
   differences.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important to patient care. The prevailing view is
   that empathy declines during university medical education. The

   This paper reports the findings in respect of two questions relating to

   1. Do men and women medical students differ in empathy?
   2. Does empathy change amongst men and women over time?
   Methods: The medical course at the University of Cambridge comprises two
   components: Core Science (Years 1-3) and Clinical (Years 4-6). Data were
   obtained from repeated questionnaire surveys of medical students from
   each component over a period of four years: 2007-2010. Participation in
   the study was voluntary.
   Empathy was measured using two subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index: IRI-EC (affective empathy) and IRI-PT (cognitive empathy). We
   analysed data separately for men and women from the Core Science and
   Clinical components. We undertook missing value analyses using logistic
   regression separately, for each measure of empathy, to examine
   non-response bias. We used Student's t-tests to examine gender
   differences and linear mixed effects regression analyses to examine
   changes over time. To assess the influence of outliers, we repeated the
   linear mixed effects regression analyses having excluded them.
   Results: Women displayed statistically significant higher mean scores
   than men for affective empathy in all 6 years of medical training and
   for cognitive empathy in 4 out of 6 years - Years 1 and 2 (Core Science
   component) and Years 4 and 5 (Clinical component).
   Amongst men, affective empathy declined slightly during both Core
   Science and Clinical components. Although statistically significant,
   both of these changes were extremely small. Cognitive empathy was
   unchanged during either component. Amongst women, neither affective
   empathy nor cognitive empathy changed during either component of the
   course.
   Analysis following removal of outliers showed a statistically
   significant slight increase in men's cognitive empathy during the Core
   Science component and slight decline in women's affective empathy during
   the Clinical component. Again, although statistically significant, these
   changes were extremely small and do not influence the study's overall
   conclusions.
   Conclusions: Amongst medical students at the University of Cambridge,
   women are more empathetic than men (a generally observed phenomenon).
   Men's affective empathy declined slightly across the course overall,
   whilst women's affective empathy showed no change. Neither men nor women
   showed any change in cognitive empathy during the course. Although
   statistically significant, the size of such changes as occurred makes
   their practical significance questionable. Neither men nor women appear
   to become meaningfully less empathetic during their medical education at
   the University of Cambridge.}},
