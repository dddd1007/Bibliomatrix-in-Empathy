Abstract = {{CONTEXT Women are in the majority in terms of entry to medical schools
   worldwide and will soon represent the majority of working doctors. This
   has been termed the `feminising' of medicine. In medical education, such
   gender issues tend to be restricted to discussions of demographic
   changes and structural inequalities based on a biological reading of
   gender. However, in contemporary social sciences, gender theory has
   moved beyond both biology and demography to include cultural issues of
   gendered ways of thinking. Can contemporary feminist thought drawn from
   the social sciences help medical educators to widen their appreciation
   and understanding of the feminising of medicine?
   DISCUSSION Post-structuralist feminist critique, drawn from the social
   sciences, focuses on cultural practices, such as language use, that
   support a dominant patriarchy. Such a critique is not exclusive to
   women, but may be described as supporting a tender-minded approach to
   practice that is shared by both women and men. The demographic
   feminising of medicine may have limited effect in terms of changing both
   medical culture and medical education practices without causing radical
   change to entrenched cultural habits that are best described as
   patriarchal. Medical education currently suffers from male biases, such
   as those imposed by `andragogy', or adult learning theory, and these can
   be positively challenged through post-structuralist feminist critique.
   CONCLUSIONS Women doctors entering the medical workforce can resist and
   reformulate the current dominant patriarchy rather than reproducing it,
   supported by male feminists. Such a feminising of medicine can extend to
   medical education, but will require an appropriate theoretical framework
   to make sense of the new territory. The feminising of medical education
   informed by post-structuralist frameworks may provide a platform for the
   democratisation of medical culture and practices, further informing
   authentic patient-centred practices of care.}},

Title = {{The consequences of authentic early experience for medical students:
   creation of metis}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{109-119}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT Authentic early experience (AEE) describes experiences provided
   to new medical students to undertake `human contact' to enhance
   learning. Although the concept of AEE is not new, and was commonplace
   prior to the Flexner Report of 1910, little is known about how or why
   meaning and knowledge are constructed through early student placements
   in medical, social and voluntary workplaces. Variance among settings
   means AEE is a collection of non-uniform, complex educational
   interventions which require students to make repeated transitions
   between different workplaces and their university institution. The
   purpose of this paper is to develop theory in this context.
   METHODS We report on a study undertaken in a UK medical school using
   interviews and discussion groups to generate data from students,
   workplace supervisors and school faculty staff. We used narrative
   analysis to access knowledge and meaning construction, in combination
   with analytic tools drawn from thematic and interpretative approaches to
   phenomena. We sought to refine theoretical understanding through the
   application of metis, a socio-cultural theory novel to the field of
   medical education.
   RESULTS Scott's concept of metis provides a useful theoretical framework
   for understanding how AEE works for students in terms of their creation
   of meaning and how they choose to use it in relation to formally
   recognised knowledge. Knowledge and meaning, generated as a consequence
   of AEE, contained dichotomies and paradoxes. Students improvised, in the
   face of unpredictability and uncertainty, to create a form of metis that
   allowed them to handle the perceived competing demands of AEE settings
   and the medical school.
   DISCUSSION We demonstrate how meaning making can be conceived of as
   student metis arising from social processes in students' learning
   interactions. We suggest that the development of collaborative working
   with students could potentiate positive forms of student metis, thereby
   maximising desirable educational consequences. Further work is required
   to establish effective ways to do this.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Outbreaks of serious communicable infectious diseases
   remain a major global medical problem and force healthcare workers to
   make hard choices with limited information, resources and time. While
   information regarding physicians' opinions about such dilemmas is
   available, research discussing students' opinions is more limited.
   Methods Medical students were surveyed about their willingness to
   perform medical procedures on patients with communicable diseases as
   students and as physicians. Students were asked about their opinions
   regarding the duty to treat in such cases.
   Results 74\% of respondents felt that by deciding to enter medical
   school they were morally obliged to treat any patient despite the risks.
   Students' willingness to treat as physicians is significantly higher
   than their willingness to treat as students. HIV was significantly the
   most tolerated disease with respect to performing mouth to mouth
   resuscitation. Among preclinical students, we found that willingness to
   treat during the later years is significantly greater than during the
   earlier years. Among clinical students, the opposite was observed.
   Discussion Students' greater willingness to treat as physicians is
   mostly attributed to perceptions of higher obligations as a qualified
   doctor. There is greater but not total willingness to perform
   resuscitation on patients with HIV relative to other diseases. The
   increased willingness of preclinical students and the decreased
   willingness of clinical students both emphasise the importance of
   patient-physician communication and ethics studies during medical
   school.}},

Title = {{Psychostimulant drug abuse and personality factors in medical students}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-57}},
Abstract = {{Background: Psychostimulants have a high abuse potential and are
   appealing to college students for enhancing their examination
   performance.
   Aim: This study was designed to examine the prevalence of
   psychostimulant drug abuse among medical students and to test the
   hypothesis that medical students who use psychostimulant drugs for
   non-medical reasons are characterized by a sensation seeking and
   aggressive-hostility personality and exhibit lower empathy.
   Methods: The Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire and the
   Jefferson Scale of Empathy were completed anonymously on-line by 321
   medical students in 2010-2011 academic year. Results: A total of 45
   students (14\%) reported that they had abused psychostimulant
   medications either before or during medical school.
   Results of multivariate analysis of variance provided support for one of
   our research hypothesis: students who reported using psychostimulant
   compared to the rest, obtained a significantly higher average score on
   the aggressive-hostility personality factor. No other significant
   differences were observed.
   Conclusion: Further research is needed to confirm the rate of
   psychostimulant drug abusers among medical students in other medical
   schools. In particular, it is desirable to examine if such
   psychostimulant drug abusers are likely to abuse other substances in
   medical school and later in their professional career.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Pages = {{63-68}},
Abstract = {{Background: Research on the correlation between personality and
   students' specialty choice is helpful in their career counselling
   process and in predicting the future distribution of the specialties in
   a country.
   Aims: This study is the first of its kind in the Arab world. The
   research questions were: (1) What is the influence of gender on the
   personality profiles of medical students? (2) What are the personality
   profiles of students categorized according to their preferred specialist
   choices? (3) What are the preferred career choices of students
   categorized according to the stage of their medical education?
   Method: A cross-sectional study was performed at King Khalid University
   Medical School including 590 students during the academic year
   2010-2011. A long version of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman personality
   questionnaire measuring five personality factors was used. Students were
   also asked for their specialty interests. Students were asked by means
   of a written questionnaire.
   Results: Study response was 92.5\%. Surgery was the single most popular
   specialty amongst both male and female students. Males had significantly
   higher scores on the `impulsive sensation seeking' scale and students
   preferring a surgery specialty had the highest score on the `impulsive
   sensation seeking', `neuroticism-anxiety', `aggression-hostility' and
   `sociability' scales. Hospital-based, surgical and primary care
   specialties became more popular as students progressed through their
   undergraduate years.
   Conclusions: Different personality types have distinct preferences in
   medical students' choice of careers. Personality and specialty choice
   research can enhance career counselling of medical students and fresh
   graduates. This also has implications for predicting the specialty
   distribution of the future health careers.}},

Pages = {{E890-E895}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is an important factor in patient-physician
   relationship that has beneficial effects in medical practice. Jefferson
   Scale of Empathy (JSE) has been specifically designed to assess empathy
   in health professionals (HP-version) and related students (S-version).
   Few validation studies have been performed on S-version of the scale.
   Aims: To examine empathy in a large sample of Iranian medical students,
   and also to study factor structure and psychometric properties of the
   Persian translation of the S-version of the JSE.
   Method: 1187 medical students (759 female) from 16 universities around
   the country participated in the study during 2009. Independent sample
   t-test, multivariate analysis of variance, and confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA) were performed to analyze the data.
   Results: Female students outscored male students in empathy. The trend
   for empathy had a negative relationship with years of education. JSE
   showed an acceptable internal consistency and test re-test reliability.
   CFA upheld the original three-factor structure - Perspective Taking,
   Compassionate Care, and Standing in the Patient's Shoes - consisting 20
   items.
   Conclusion: The decrease in empathy during medical education is
   consistent with previous studies. The Persian version of JSE is a valid
   and reliable measure to tap empathy in a Persian-speaking medical
   student.}},

Abstract = {{Personality distinctions exist between male and female doctors, and
   between surgeons and non-surgeons, but given the predominance of males
   in surgery, the personality profile of females interested in surgery is
   less clear. This study examined personality and other attributes of
   female medical students attracted to the surgical profession. A total of
   580 second-year medical students in Australia completed questionnaires
   that measured their likelihood of considering various medical
   specialties, personality traits using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory
   (NEO-FFI), and the importance of several other parameters in directing
   career choice. Significantly fewer females than males rated surgery
   highly likely as a career. Females interested in surgery had higher
   Neuroticism and Agreeableness scores, and placed greater importance on
   ability to help people, and less importance on prestige and financial
   reward compared to males interested in surgery. Compared to males not
   interested in surgery, females interested in surgery had higher Openness
   scores, and placed greater importance on ability to help people,
   interesting and challenging work, and less importance on lifestyle.
   Lastly, females interested in surgery had lower Agreeableness scores,
   and placed greater importance on prestige and less importance on
   lifestyle compared to females not interested in surgery. Common findings
   that surgeons compared to non-surgeons are more tough-minded, less
   patient-oriented and less empathic may be a function of the prevalence
   of males in surgery. In our sample, the females interested in surgery
   retained an overall similar personality profile to those less
   interested, with only few differences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
