Abstract = {{In response to the articles in this issue about measuring physician
   empathy by Hojat and colleagues, Di Lillo and colleagues, and Kataoka
   and colleagues, this commentary further explores the concept of empathy.
   It is posited that empathy is an emotion important to medical care, but
   it is emphasized that it really doesn't matter whether empathy is a
   thought or an emotion. Retaining or enhancing it in medical care givers
   is worth doing and may be achieved through (1) the selection of medical
   students and others who will care for the sick, (2) the training
   caretakers receive, and more fundamentally even, (3) reconsideration of
   what doctors do in a world so much changed and so diverse.
   Empathy is the foundation of patient care, and it should frame the
   skills of the profession. It may be that empathy can be taught by
   example, but the minds of students, like soil, must be prepared before
   they can nourish seeds of knowledge, and in some soils little grows.
   Physicians must have the time to listen to their patients. Listening can
   create empathy-if physicians remain open to be moved by the stories they
   hear. Empathy has always been and will always be among a physician's
   most essential tools of practice.}},

Title = {{The Devil is in the Third Year: A Longitudinal Study of Erosion of
   Empathy in Medical School}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1182-1191}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This longitudinal study was designed to examine changes in medical
   students' empathy during medical school and to determine when the most
   significant changes occur.
   Method
   Four hundred fifty-six students who entered Jefferson Medical College in
   2002 (n = 227) and 2004 (n = 229) completed the Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy at five different times: at entry into medical school
   on orientation day and subsequently at the end of each academic year.
   Statistical analyses were performed for the entire cohort, as well as
   for the ``matched{''} cohort (participants who identified themselves at
   all five test administrations) and the ``unmatched{''} cohort
   (participants who did not identify themselves in all five test
   administrations).
   Results
   Statistical analyses showed that empathy scores did not change
   significantly during the first two years of medical school. However, a
   significant decline in empathy scores was observed at the end of the
   third year which persisted until graduation. Findings were similar for
   the matched cohort (n = 121) and for the rest of the sample (unmatched
   cohort, n = 335). Patterns of decline in empathy scores were similar for
   men and women and across specialties.
   Conclusions
   It is concluded that a significant decline in empathy occurs during the
   third year of medical school. It is ironic that the erosion of empathy
   occurs during a time when the curriculum is shifting toward patient-care
   activities; this is when empathy is most essential. Implications for
   retaining and enhancing empathy are discussed.}},

Title = {{Measurement of Empathy Among Japanese Medical Students: Psychometrics
   and Score Differences by Gender and Level of Medical Education}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine psychometric properties of a Japanese translation of the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), and to study differences in
   empathy scores between men and women, and students in different years of
   medical school.
   Method
   The student version of the JSPE was translated into Japanese using
   back-translation procedures and administered to 400 Japanese students
   from all six years at the Okayama University Medical School. Item-total
   score correlations were calculated. Factor analysis was used to examine
   the underlying components of the Japanese version of the JSPE. Cronbach
   coefficient alpha was calculated to assess the internal consistency
   aspect of reliability of the instrument. Finally, empathy scores for men
   and women were compared using t test, and score differences by year of
   medical school were examined using analysis of variance.
   Results
   Factor analysis confirmed the three components of ``perspective
   taking,{''} ``compassionate care,{''} and ``ability to stand in
   patient's shoes,{''} which had emerged in American and Mexican medical
   students. Item-total score correlations were all positive and
   statistically significant. Cronbach coefficient alpha was .80. Women
   outscored men, and empathy scores increased as students progressed
   through medical school in this cross-sectional study.
   Conclusions
   Findings provide support for the construct validity and reliability of
   the Japanese translated version of the JSPE for medical students.
   Cultural characteristics and educational differences in Japanese medical
   schools that influence empathic behaviors are described, and
   implications for cross-cultural study of empathy are discussed.}},

Title = {{The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy: Preliminary Psychometrics and
   Group Comparisons in Italian Physicians}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine the psychometrics of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE) among a sample of Italian physicians.
   Method
   The JSPE was translated into Italian using back-translation procedures
   to ensure the accuracy of the translation. The translated JSPE was
   administered to 778 physicians at three hospitals in Rome, Italy in
   2002. Individual empathy scores were calculated, as well as descriptive
   statistics at the item and scale level. Group comparisons of empathy
   scores were also made among men and women, physicians practicing in
   medical or surgical specialties, physicians working in different
   hospitals, and at physicians at various levels of career rank.
   Results
   Results are reported for 289 participants who completed the JSPE.
   Item-total score correlations were all positive and statistically
   significant. The prominent component of ``perspective taking,{''} which
   is the most important underlying construct of the scale, emerged in the
   factor analysis of the JSPE and was similar in both Italian and American
   samples. However, more factors appeared among Italian physicians,
   indicating that the underlying construct of empathy may be more complex
   among Italians. Cronbach coefficient alpha was .85. None of the group
   differences observed among physicians classified by gender, hospital of
   practice, specialty, or level of career rank reached statistical
   significance.
   Conclusions
   Findings generally provide support for the construct validity and
   reliability of the Italian version of the JSPE. Further research is
   needed to determine whether the lack of statistically significant
   differences in empathy by gender and specialty is related to cultural
   peculiarities, the translation of the scale, or sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the association of parent behavior with infant
   distress during a potentially painful medical procedure. A second aim
   was to investigate the association of parent chronic pain and
   psychological problems with parent behavior and infant distress during
   the procedure. Design: Population-based cohort study with both
   cross-sectional and prospective measurements. Main Outcome Measures:
   Video recordings of 275 parents and their 14-month-old infant undergoing
   venipuncture were coded with an observational instrument to yield
   measures of infant distress behaviors and parent behaviors, such as
   reassuring, showing empathy, praising, and distracting. Parent chronic
   pain and psychological problems were assessed through questionnaires.
   Results: Infants cried 58\% of procedure duration. Parent reassuring
   occurred 34\% of procedure duration, and parent distracting occurred
   37\% of procedure duration. Infant distress was positively related to
   parent reassuring and negatively related to parent praising. Parent
   chronic pain was related to increased parent distracting but not to
   parent reassuring. Parent psychological problems were not associated
   with parent behavior and infant distress. Conclusion: Parent behavior
   rather than psychological traits is related to increased venipuncture
   distress in young infants. This finding suggests that the focus should
   be on interventions based on behavior modification.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There is a growing amount of empirical research on empathy in
   medicine. This critical review assesses methodological limitations in
   this body of research that have not received adequate attention.
   Methods: Scientific publications presenting empirical research on
   medical students' or physicians' empathy were systematically searched
   for.
   Results: 206 publications were identified and critically reviewed.
   Multiple empirical approaches have been used. However, there are some
   remarkable tendencies given the complexity of the study object: empathy
   is often not defined. Qualitative approaches are rarely used and the
   predominant quantitative instruments have a relatively narrow or
   peripheral scope. For example, the concrete experiences, feelings, and
   interpretations of the physician and the patient, and empathy in
   clinical practice, are often neglected. Furthermore, possible influences
   of medical training and working conditions on empathy have not been
   adequately explored.
   Conclusion: The empirical studies of empathy in medicine tend to
   separate empathy from main parts of clinical perception, judgment, and
   communication. Thus, important aspects and influences of empathy have
   been relatively neglected.
   Practice implications: Future studies should include transparent
   concepts, more than one method and perspective, qualitative approaches,
   the physician's and the patient's concrete experiences and
   interpretations, and the context in which empathy is developed and
   practiced. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure rapport between medical students and standardized
   patients using observer ratings; to relate these ratings to students'
   emotional awareness and to behavior within the medical interaction; and
   to assess the relative validity of using excerpts of different lengths
   for the measurement of rapport.
   Methods: Third-year medical students (N = 141) were videotaped during a
   15-min interaction with a standardized patient, and rapport as well as
   other communication variables were measured using trained coders.
   Rapport was measured with good interrater reliability by trained coders
   who viewed three 1-min excerpts. Emotional awareness was measured by a
   test of recognizing facial expressions of emotion, self-ratings of
   emotional self-awareness, and peer ratings of interpersonal sensitivity.
   Finally, participants who viewed the videotapes while imagining
   themselves to be the patient (analogue patients) provided impressions of
   the students, including satisfaction.
   Results: Rapport based on all three minutes was positively correlated
   with accuracy in decoding facial expressions of emotion, self-reported
   attention to one's own emotions, peer ratings of sensitivity,
   communication behaviors of the medical student and standardized patient,
   and analogue patients' positive impressions and satisfaction. Rapport
   based on just the first minute of the interaction was significantly
   related to many of these variables.
   Conclusion: Rating short excerpts of behavior is a valid and efficient
   methodology for capturing the concept of rapport.
   Practice implications: Clinicians, researchers, and educators should
   focus on rapport building, even very early in the medical visit. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: A body of evidence suggests that good interaction is crucial
   for high-quality medical practice and has a considerable impact on
   treatment outcomes. Less is known about the role and significance of
   doctor-patient interaction in rehabilitation. The study aim was to
   capture perceived quality of doctor-patient interaction in
   rehabilitation by a rating instrument (P.A.INT-Questionnaire. P.A.INT is
   the abbreviation for Patient-Arzt-Interaktion (German)) and to examine
   the relationship between perceived quality of interaction and long-term
   treatment outcomes.
   Methods: Referring to the approach of Bensing {[}Bensing JM. Doctor
   patient communication and the quality of care. Utrecht: NIVEL; 1990] we
   defined ``quality of interaction{''} in terms of three dimensions: (1)
   affective behaviour, i.e. empathy, positive regard and coherence
   {[}Rogers CR. Die nicht direktive Beratung Munchen: Kindler
   Studienausgabe {[}Counselling and psychotherapy, 1942]. Boston; 1972];
   (2) instrumental behaviour: providing and collecting information.
   structuring and reinforcement; (3) participation and involvement of
   patients. Two parallel versions of the questionnaire were developed for
   patients and physicians. Seven rehabilitation clinics in north western
   Germany participated in the multicentre study. Sixty-one doctors and
   their four hundred and seventy patients evaluated both their shared
   dialogues upon admission, discharge and ward round. Furthermore,
   patients rated their health status on admission (t0), discharge (t1) and
   six months after discharge (t2) with the IRES-3 (Indicators of
   Rehabilitation Status Questionnaire, Version 3).
   Results: (1) Comparisons of patient and physician evaluations on
   admission revealed the following: affective quality of contact (empathy
   and coherence) was rated positively and without discrepancies by both
   patients and physicians. On the other hand, instrumental behaviour
   (information and structuring) was rated less positively by patients than
   by physicians. (2) Patients who rated the dialogue on admission more
   positively showed stronger treatment effects with respect to pain as
   well as to anxiety at discharge and six months after discharge. Analysis
   for single scales of the P.A.INT-Questionnaire revealed that this is due
   to affective and instrumental quality of the dialogues.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest a correlation between perceived
   interaction quality, as defined by our questionnaire and treatment
   effects six months after discharge. Comparisons of patient and physician
   evaluations showed that physicians seem to be successful in building
   relationships on the affective level, but less successful on the
   instrumental level (i.e. information, structuring and reinforcement).
   They also perceive disturbances on the relational and organisational
   level more strongly than patients.
   Practice implications: Our data underline the importance of interaction
   quality for the success of rehabilitation and thus the importance of
   specific skills such as providing and collecting information,
   recognizing patients' concerns and goals as well as reinforcement of
   health related action. Regular training and supervision should be
   provided to support physicians and to enhance their competence in
   dealing with patients concerns. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Suffering is the experience of distress or disharmony caused by the
   loss, or threatened loss, of what we most cherish. Such losses may strip
   away the beliefs by which we construct a meaningful narrative of human
   life in general and our own in particular. The vocation of physicians
   and other health professionals is to relieve suffering caused by
   illness, trauma,and bodily degeneration. However, since suffering is an
   existential state that does not necessarily parallel physical or
   emotional states, physicians cannot rely solely on knowledge and skills
   that address physiological dysfunction. Rather, they must learn to
   engage the patient at an existential level. Unfortunately, however,
   medical pedagogy encourages ``detached concern:{''} which devalues
   subjectivity, emotion, relationship, and solidarity The term
   ``compassionate solidarity{''} summarizes an alternative model, which
   begins with empathic listening and responding, requires reflectivity and
   self-understanding, and is in itself a healing act. Poetry, along with
   other imaginative writing, may help physicians and other health
   professionals grow in self-awareness and gain deeper understanding of
   suffering, empathy, compassion, and symbolic healing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report the proportion of Canadian medical students
   interested in a career in psychiatry at medical school entry and to
   describe the unique demographics and career influences associated With
   this early interest.
   Methods: From 2001 to 2004, during the first 2 weeks of medical school,
   a 41-item survey of career choice, demographics, and attitudes toward
   various aspects of medical practice was distributed to all students in
   18 classes at 8 Canadian medical schools. Associations between early
   career interest, demographics, and career influences were explored.
   Results: Of the 2096 completed surveys, 3.2\% of students named
   psychiatry as their first career choice. While 34\% of students
   considered psychiatry a possible career option, 54.9\% stated that they
   had not considered this option. Students interested in psychiatry were
   more likely than other students to have an undergraduate education in
   the arts, to have close family or friends practicing medicine, and to
   have worked voluntarily with people with mental illness. Students
   interested in psychiatry had a lesser social orientation than students
   interested in family medicine but had a greater social orientation and
   lesser hospital orientation than students interested in other
   specialties.
   Conclusions: Enhanced psychiatric care may be aided by the selective
   recruitment into medical school of students with a demonstrated empathy
   toward people with mental illness, an educational background in the
   arts, and a strong social orientation. As career influences change
   throughout medical school, participants in this study will be
   re-surveyed at graduation to better understand the evolution of career
   choice decision-making throughout medical school. Can J Psychiatry.

Title = {{Measuring patient's expectation and the perception of quality in LASIK
   services}},
Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: LASIK is the use of excimer lasers to treat therapeutic and
   refractive visual disorders, ranging from superficial scars to
   nearsightedness (myopia), and from astigmatism to farsightedness
   (hyperopia). The purposes of this study are to checking the
   applicability and psychometric properties of the SERVQUAL on Lasik
   surgery population. Second, use SEM methods to investigate the loyalty,
   perceptions and expectations relationship on LASIK surgery.
   Methods: The method with which this study was conducted was
   questionnaire development. A total of 463 consecutive patients,
   attending LASIK surgery affiliated with Chung Shan Medical University
   Eye Center, enrolled in this study. All participants were asked to
   complete revised SERVQUAL questionnaires. Student t test, correlation
   test, and ANOVA and factor analyses were used to identify the characters
   and factors of service quality. Paired t test were used to test the gap
   between expectation and perception scores and structural equation
   modeling was used to examine relationships among satisfaction
   components.
   Results: The effective response rate was 97.3\%. Validity was verified
   by several methods and internal reliability Cronbach's alpha was >0.958.
   The results from patient's scores were very high with an overall score
   of 6.41(0.66), expectations at 6.68(0.47), and perceptions at
   6.51(0.57). The gap between expectations and perceptions was
   significant, however, (t = 6.08). Furthermore, there were significant
   differences in the expectation scores among the different jobs. Also,
   the results showed that the higher the education of the patient, the
   lower their perception score (r = -0.10). The factor loading results of
   factor analysis showed 5 factors of the 22 items of the SERVQUAL model.
   The 5 factors of perception explained 72.94\% of the total variance
   there; and on expectations it explained 77.12\% of the total variance of
   satisfaction scores. The goodness-of-fit summary, of structure equation
   modeling, showed trends in concept on expectations, perceptions, and
   loyalty.
   Conclusion: The results of this research appear to show that the
   SERVQUAL instrument is a useful measurement tool in assessing and
   monitoring service quality in LASIK service, and enabling staff to
   identify where improvements are needed, from the patients' perspective.
   There were service quality gaps in the reliability, assurance, and
   empathy. This study suggested that physicians should increase their
   discussions with patients; which has, of course, already been proven to
   be an effective way to increase patient's satisfaction with medical
   care, regardless of the procedure received.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE while historic medical oaths and numerous contemporary medical
   organizations offer guidelines for professionalism, the nature of the
   professional aspirations, commitments, and values of current medical
   students is not well known. We sought to provide a thematic catalogue of
   individual mission statements written by medical students nationally.
   METHODS In the Healer's Art elective course, students write a personal
   mission statement about their highest professional values. In 2006-2007,
   we randomly selected 100 student mission statements from 10
   representative schools nationally. Three researchers coded content using
   a team-based qualitative approach and categorized the codes into major
   themes. Student mission statements were compared with classic medical
   oaths and contemporary professionalism guidelines.
   RESULTS The mission statements were similar across different schools,
   Three major themes emerged, comprised of codes identified in 20\% or
   more of the mission statements. The first theme, professional skills,
   includes dealing with the negatives of training, listening and empathy,
   growth and development. The second theme, personal qualities, includes
   wholeness, humility, and constancy/perfectionism. The third theme, scope
   of professional practice, includes physician relationships, positive
   emotions, healing, service, spirituality, and balance. Unlike the
   content of classic oaths and contemporary professionalism statements,
   the students' statements dealt with fears, personal-professional
   balance, love, non-hierachical relationships, self-care, healing, and
   awe as key to being a physician.
   CONCLUSIONS In their personal mission statements, this national cohort
   of medical students described an expanded view of physicianhood that
   includes such elements as presence, love, and awe. Medical school
   curricula may require adaptation to support the personal aspirations of
   those now entering the profession.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study's objective was to assess the relationship of
   empathy in medical office visits to subsequent outcomes,of the common
   cold. Methods: A total of 350 subjects >= 12 years of age received
   either a standard or enhanced physician visit as part of a randomized
   controlled trial. Enhanced visits emphasized empathy on the part of the
   physician. The patient-scored Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
   questionnaire assessed practitioner-patient interaction, especially
   empathy. Cold severity and duration were assessed from twice-daily
   symptom reports. Nasal wash was performed to measure the immune cytokine
   interleukin-8 (IL-8). Results: Eighty-four individuals reported perfect
   (score of 50) CARE scores. They tended to be older with less education
   but reported similar health status, quality of life, and levels of
   optimism. In those with perfect CARE scores, cold duration was shorter
   (mean 7.10 days versus 8.01 days), and there was a trend toward reduced
   severity (mean area under receiver-operator characteristics curve 240.40
   versus 284.49). After accounting for possible confounding variables,
   cold severity and duration were significantly lower in those reporting
   perfect CARE scores. In these models, a perfect score also correlated
   with a larger increase in IL-8 levels. Conclusions: Clinician empathy,
   as perceived by patients with the common cold, significantly predicts
   subsequent duration and severity of illness and is associated with
   immune system changes.}},

   Design: Qualitative study from an academic cardiology clinic, using
   semistructured interviews with 18 survivors of sudden cardiac death.
   Results: Patients believed that respecting persons incorporates the
   following major elements: empathy, care, autonomy, provision of
   information, recognition of individuality, dignity and attention to
   needs.
   Conclusions: Making patients feel respected, or valued as a person, is a
   multi-faceted task that involves more than recognising autonomy. While
   patients' views of respect do not determine what respect means, these
   patients expressed important intuitions that may be of substantial

Title = {{Patients' reflections on communication in the second-opinion

Abstract = {{Objective: The nature of communication between patients and their
   second-opinion hematology consultants may be very different in these
   one-time consultations than for those that are within long-term
   relationships. This study explored patients' perceptions of their
   second-opinion hematology-oncology consultation to investigate
   physician-patient communication in malignant disease at a critical
   juncture in cancer patients' care and decision-making.
   Methods: In-depth telephone interviews with a subset of 20 patients from
   a larger study, following their subspecialty hematology consultations.
   Results: Most patients wanted to contribute to the consultation agenda,
   but were unable to do so. Patients sought expert and honest advice
   delivered with empathy, though most did not expect the consultant to
   directly address their emotions. They wanted the physician to apply
   his/her knowledge to the specifics of their individual cases, and were
   disappointed and distrustful when physicians cited only general
   prognostic statistics. In contrast, physicians' consideration of the
   unique elements of patients' cases, and demonstrations of empathy and
   respect made patients' feel positively about the encounter, regardless
   of the prognosis.
   Conclusions: Patients provided concrete recommendations for physician
   and patient behaviors to enhance the consultation.
   Practice implications: Consideration of these recommendations may result
   in more effective communication and increased patient satisfaction with
   medical visits. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second part of an analytic review of doctor-patient
   relationship (DPR) from an ethical point of view. In the previous part I
   have described and analysed the goals of and processes in different
   bioethics models of doctor-patient relationship. I have argued that the
   bioethics models of doctor-patient relationship are normative and
   prescriptive in nature and that the effectiveness of different models to
   promote their assumed goals is not assessed empirically. In this part of
   the review, I analyse different clinical models of doctor-patient
   relationship with the aim of understanding. the relation between the
   theoretical and philosophical arguments behind different models of
   doctor-patient relationship with the empirical evidence on the
   effectiveness of different models to promote their goals if implemented
   at the level of health care. The process in the DPR is at the core of
   the clinical models of DPR, namely patient-centred care model (PCC) and
   relationship-centred care model (RCC) {[}1]. Since its inception more
   than fifty years ago through the early work of Balint {[}2] and Engel
   {[}3] clinical models of DPR have gained a high profile in general
   practice and are considered a central feature of quality practice {[}4].
   In this section, I analyse through an ethical lens the concepts and
   ideas that are commonly described and empirically studied in the
   literature surrounding the clinical models of DPR. I argue that clinical
   models of DPR, similarly to bioethical models of DPR, are prescriptive
   and normative in nature. First, I describe and analyse from an ethical
   point of view the patient-centred care (PCC) model of DPR. I argue that
   some of the ethical meanings of the different dimensions of this model
   are not made clear by its proponents. Second, I describe and outline the
   relation-centred care (RCC) model of DPR and the empirical research
   surrounding the process in DPR. I describe the communication patterns
   that characterize RCC and outline the empirical research on their
   effectiveness to promote beneficence and patients' autonomy. I argue
   that there is some evidence that a process in DPR characterized by these
   communication patterns could promote both benefice and patients'
   autonomy. Third, I compare the clinical and bioethics models of
   doctor-patient relationship. I argue that the similarities between
   Brody's relational model of doctor-patient relationship and RCC model of
   doctor-patient relationship may suggest that the implementation of this
   model at the level of care could be effective to promote both
   beneficence and patient autonomy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to compare psychiatric patients' satisfaction
   with their treatment in Munich and in South Tirol. For this purpose,
   besides clinical and social-demografic factors, for each sample-group of
   patients, their general satisfaction, their valuation of the different
   aspects of hospital treatment and life quality were considered and
   compared. The relevance of these elements in the global satisfaction was
   examined with linear multiple regression models. The results of the
   research show a rather high level of global satisfaction in both
   sample-groups, even if statistically relevant differences occur in
   valuations of several aspects of the treatment. In Munich's sample-group
   a higher rate of satisfaction emerged in relation with the treatment:
   the attitude of the medical staff, the psycho-pharmalogical treatments,
   the clinic's image and the conduct of the nursing staff. In both groups
   the most relevant factor for patients' satisfaction, besides the
   positive results of the treatment, was the attitude of the doctor, and
   in particular way his empathy with the patient. In regard to the age,
   the diagnosis and the duration of the hospitalization, it wasn't
   possible to demonstrate, in both sample-groups, any statistically
   relevant connection with the general satisfaction rate, while a high
   rate of trust in the doctors and in the medicines was found to be, in
   each group, a significant condition for a positive evaluation of the
   treatment. The influence of the personal life-quality was proven
   statistically relevant but weak. Altogether, regardless of the medical
   structure that was examined, the results underline the predominant
   importance of the curing doctor's social and emotional skills for
   patients' satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the development, implementation, and psychometric
   assessment of the multiple mini-interview (MMI) for the inaugural class
   of veterinary medicine applicants at the University of Calgary Faculty
   of Veterinary Medicine (UCVM). The MMI is a series of approximately five
   to 12 10-minute interviews that consist of situational events.
   Applicants are given a scenario and asked to work through an issue or
   behavioral-type questions that are meant to assess one attribute (e.g.,
   empathy) at a time. This structure allows for multiple assessments of
   the applicants by trained interviewers on the same questions. MMI
   scenario development was based on a review of the noncognitive
   attributes currently assessed by the 31 veterinary schools across Canada
   and the United States and the goals and objectives of UCVM. The
   noncognitive attributes of applicants (N=110) were assessed at five
   stations, by two interviewers within each station, on three items using
   a standardized rating form on an anchored 1-5 scale. The method was
   determined to be reliable (G-coefficient=0.88) and demonstrated evidence
   of validity. The MMI score did not correlate with grade-point average
   (r=0.12, p=0.22). While neither the applicants nor interviewers had
   participated in an MMI format before, both groups reported the process
   to be acceptable in a post-interview questionnaire. This analysis
   provides preliminary evidence of the reliability, validity, and
   acceptability of the MMI in assessing the noncognitive attributes of
   applicants for veterinary medical school admissions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite only modest evidence linking personality-type variables to
   medical specialty choice, stereotypes involving empathy and `emotional
   connectedness' persist, especially between primary care providers and
   surgeons or subspecialists. This paper examines emotional intelligence
   (EI) and specialty choice among students at three US medical schools.
   Results from three independent studies are presented. Study 1 used the
   Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT (TM))
   administered to a single cohort of 84 Year 4 medical students. Study 2
   used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) and Davis' Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index (IRI) administered to three cohorts (n = 250) of Year 3
   medical students. Study 3 used the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory
   (EQ-I((R))) administered to two cohorts of Year 1 medical students (n =
   292). Results were linked to specialty choice data retrieved from the
   National Residency Match Program (NRMP). Classifications of specialty
   choice included: (i) primary care (family practice, internal medicine,
   paediatrics) versus non-primary care (all others), and (ii) primary
   care, hospital-based specialties (anaesthesiology, emergency medicine,
   pathology, radiology), and technical and surgical specialties
   (neurology, obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, and all surgical
   fields).
   Across all three studies - and using both classifications of specialty
   choice - no significant differences in EI were found between students
   entering primary care and non-primary care specialties. Limitations are
   acknowledged, and future directions for research involving EI are
   identified.}},

   effectiveness at the second level of Kirkpatrick's evaluation method.
   Material and Methods: In this study, to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the program, students were evaluated before and after the basic
   communication skills training. The students (n=127, 87\%) participating
   in both evaluations were included in the study. During the evaluations,
   each student made a 5 to 6 minute-long conversation with a simulated
   classmate performing a structured case. Each student was individually
   evaluated by his/her small group trainer using an evaluation scale
   including items on critical basic communication skills. Results: The
   total score was 57.97 +/- 10.69 for pre-training and 77.55 +/- 11.26 for
   post-training (p= 0.000). There was no significant difference between
   the pre-training scores of female and male students. The post-training
   scores of the female students were significantly higher than the scores

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine if attitudes associated with body checking,
   emotional empathy, and aggression differ between players in body
   checking and non-body checking hockey leagues and to determine the
   influence of these attitudes on injury rates.
   Design: Prospective cohort.
   Setting: Participants were randomly recruited by team from the Calgary
   Minor Hockey Association at the beginning of the 2006-2007 season.
   Participants: There were 283 participants from Pee Wee (aged 11-12
   vears), Bantam (aged 13-14 years), and Midget (aged 15-16 years) teams.
   Of 13 teams from the body checking league, 138 players participated, and
   of 24 teams in the non-body checking league, 145 players participated.
   Assessment of Risk Factors: Participants completed 4 self-report
   questionnaires: (1) Medical Questionnaire, (2) Body Checking
   Questionnaire, (3) Empathy Index for Children and Adolescents, and (4)
   Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measures: Participants were followed through the season for
   injury reports. The injury definition included any hockey injury
   resulting in medical attention, the inability to complete a hockey
   session, and/or missing a subsequent hockey session.
   Results: Body checking players reported more positive attitudes toward
   body checking (35.59; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 34.52-36.65) than
   non-body checking players (22.43; 95\%, CI, 21.38-23.49; t = -1 7.34 P <
   0.00005). There was no significant difference in the empathy scores
   between cohorts (t = 1.51 P = 0.13). The mean aggression score for the
   body checking players (76.22; 95\% CI 73.18-79.25) was significantly
   higher than the mean for the non-body checking players (70.57; 95\% CI,
   67.35-73.80; t = -2.52: P = 0.013).
   Conclusions: Body checking seems to influence attitudes toward body
   checking and aggression, but attitudes toward body checking, empathy,
   and aggression did not influence injury rates.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Reflective writing is an established method for teaching
   medical students empathetic interactions, though little is known about
   students' reflections on connecting with patients during the clinical
   clerkship. The purpose of this study was to describe factors that
   medical Students perceive contribute to or detract from making
   connections with patients and families, as identified in a writing
   assignment during the pediatric clinical clerkship.
   Methods: Reflective essays submitted by third-year medical students
   about interacting with patients/families during their pediatric
   clerkship were qualitatively analyzed for thematic content.
   Results: Major themes emerging in 44 essays analyzed included time,
   knowledge, language and culture, and actions. Barriers to connecting for
   some Students were considered resources by others. Critical reflection
   was present in 31.8\%.
   Conclusions: Students' perceptions of factors that influence their
   interactions with patients and families will enhance or detract their
   ability to make connections. Through reflection, medical students -
   amidst clinical responsibilities - can identify how, why, and whether or
   not connections with patients/families have occurred.
   Practice implications: Recognizing what factors medical students
   perceive as enhancing and detracting from connecting with
   patients/families will help preceptors foster those connections and
   mitigate barriers. Future study could assess how to best provide
   specific individualized feedback to best enhance critical reflection. We
   recommend the inclusion of brief reflective writing exercises during
   clinical clerkships in medical school, as it may augment students'
   ability to connect. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which for
   pharmaceutical students training, adequate methods should be used for
   evaluating a student's skill and aptitude for good communication in a
   medical interview. However, the reliability of the evaluation methods
   used in the pharmaceutical OSCE has not been investigated sufficiently.
   In this study, we reviewed the evaluation scores and video recordings
   obtained in a pharmaceutical OSCE trial, and examined the reasons for
   disagreement in the scores between two raters. We had two experienced
   raters in medical communication re-evaluate the students using the vide
   images, and compared their scores with those on the examination day. The
   ratio of disagreement was 14.5 \%, (87/600 items in 30 Students), and
   the reason for disagreement Could not be identified for 63 items that
   evaluated communication skills such as `actively listen' and `empathy'.
   A comparison of the scores on examination day and those on re-evaluation
   revealed a possible reason for the disagreement; the use of a checklist,
   i.e. binary scores, with criteria that differed between the raters. We
   Suggest that the items used for a detailed performance evaluation be
   selected carefully and that rating scales be used in order to perform
   ail adequate evaluation, especially regarding Communication skill and
   aptitude.}},

Title = {{Increasing Bioethics Education in Preclinical Medical Curricula: What
   Ethical Dilemmas Do Clinical Clerks Experience?}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{498-504}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The increase in bioethics education in preclinical curricula enables
   medical students to recognize ethical issues and determine right action.
   The authors sought to explore the ethical dilemmas medical students
   experience during clinical clerkships.
   Method
   Following an e-mail invitation, 100 of 104 graduating medical students
   allowed their final ethics assignment, a written description of an
   ethical dilemma experienced during clinical clerkship, to be analyzed.
   After all identifiers were removed, the narratives underwent qualitative
   analysis and were then reanalyzed using Jameton's determinants of moral
   action.
   Results
   Four themes emerged: the clinical service rotation, target, source, and
   nature of the ethical dilemma. For many clinical clerks, the ethical
   dilemma arose because they recognized an ethical issue but neither
   brought it to their supervisors nor resolved it themselves for fear of
   incurring disfavor. The source of the ethical dilemma was most
   frequently the student's supervisor (46\%), which may explain why,
   although all narratives demonstrated the Jameton criteria of ``moral
   sensitivity{''} and 76\% demonstrated ``moral judgment,{''} only 24\%
   indicated ``moral motivation{''} and only 4\% suggested ``moral
   courage.{''} Patients were the most frequent target (76\%), followed by
   students (14\%). Students reported informed consent (18\%) and
   inadequate care (17\%) as the most common types of dilemmas under the
   nature theme.
   Conclusions
   Clinical clerks' experiences of ethical dilemmas might be mitigated if
   residency education and professional development mirrored the increase
   in preclinical ethics education, if ethics training included encouraging
   students to discuss ethical issues as they arise, and if educators
   developed innovative models of student evaluation.}},

   Preventing progression to chronicity in first onset, subacute low back
   pain: an exploratory Study. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90:545-52.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a behavioral medicine
   intervention, relative to an attention control, in preventing chronic
   pain and disability in patients with first-onset, Subacute low back pain
   (LBP) with limitations in work-role function.
   Design: A 2-group, experimental design with randomization to behavioral
   medicine or attention control groups.
   Setting: Orthopedic clinic at a Naval Medical Center.
   Participants: Sixty-seven participants with first-onset LBP of 6 to 10
   weeks of duration and impairment in work function, of whom 50 completed
   all 4 therapy sessions and follow-up 6 months after pain onset.
   Intervention: Four 1-hour individual treatment sessions of either
   behavioral medicine, focused on back function and pain education,
   self-management training, graded activity increases, fear reduction, and
   pain belief change; or attention control condition, focused on empathy,
   support, and reassurance.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was proportion of
   participants classified as recovered, according to pre-established
   clinical cutoffs on standardized measures, signifying absence of chronic
   pain and disability at 6 months after pain onset. Secondary analyses
   were conducted on pain, disability, health status, and functional work
   category. Intervention credibility and pain belief manipulation checks
   were also evaluated.
   Results: Chi square analyses comparing proportions recovered at 6 months
   after pain onset for behavioral medicine and attention control
   participants found relative rates of 52\% versus 31\% in the modified
   intent-to-treat sample (P=.09) and 54\% versus 23\% for those completing
   all 4 sessions and 6-month follow-up (P=.02). At 12 months, 79\% of
   recovered and 68\% of chronic pain participants still met criteria for
   their respective groups (P<.0001). Recovered participants also had
   higher rates of functional work status recovery at 12 months (recovered:
   96\% full duty and 4\% light duty; chronic pain: 61\% full duty, 18\%
   light duty, and 21\% medical discharge, respectively; P=.03).
   Conclusions: Early intervention using a behavioral medicine
   rehabilitation approach may enhance recovery and reduce chronic pain and
   disability in patients with first-onset, subacute LBP. Effects are
   stronger for participants attending all 4 sessions and the follow-up
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine whether an educational intervention that focused
   on physician communication training influenced physician ernpathic

   Methods: This study used a quantitative research method to investigate
   the influence of communication training on physician-expressed empathy

   behavior.
   Results: The differences in global empathy scores in the physician
   training group from baseline to follow-up improved by 37\%, and
   hierarchical scores of physician empathic expression improved by up to
   51\% from baseline scores for the same group.
   Conclusions: The results strongly supported the hypotheses that training
   made a significant difference in physician empathic expression during
   patient interactions demonstrated by both outside observer measures of

Abstract = {{Objective: Communication skills, including patient-centered interviewing
   (PCI), have become a major priority for educational and licensing
   organizations in the United States. While patient-centered interviewing
   is associated with positive patient outcomes and improved diagnostic
   accuracy, it is unknown if an association exists between
   patient-centered interviewing and Student performance in high-stakes
   clinical skills assessment (CSA) examinations. The purpose of this study
   was to determine if generic communication skills and patient-centered
   interviewing skills were associated with students' overall student
   performance on a multi-station clinical skills assessment (CSA)
   examination.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study to assess student performance
   with standardized patients (SPs). We conducted a retrospective review of
   30 videotaped SP encounters of Third year medical students (class of
   2006) at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. We measured
   correlations between observed PCI scores, overall, CSA scores and CSA
   interpersonal and communication (ICS) skills Scores of student-SP
   encounters.
   Results: PCI scores, as measured with the Four-Habits Coding Scheme, a
   measurement tool of patient-centered communication, were not correlated
   with either overall CSA scores or ICS scores. Students' PCI scores were
   lower than the ICS scores (57\% vs. 85\% of correct items). The students
   performed poorly (30\% mean score of correct items) in eliciting patient
   perspectives, compared to three other domains (Invest in the beginning,
   Demonstrate empathy, and Invest in end) of patient-centered
   interviewing.
   Conclusions: Our study failed to demonstrate any association between
   student performance and patient-centered interviewing skills (PCI) in
   the setting of a comprehensive in-house CSA examination. Third-year
   medical students in our Study did not practice some elements of
   patient-centered interviewing. Practice implications: Given the
   increasing importance of patient-centered communication, the high-stakes
   in-house clinical skills examinations may consider assessing
   patient-centered interviewing using a more comprehensive and valid
   checklist. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The author outlines the cross-cultural and widespread expectation that
   the moral character of physicians is built on dual possession of skill
   and compassion. The details of the moral makeup of physicians are often
   hotly debated in the biomedical literature. Despite a lack of consensus
   regarding the required aspects of character, the author demonstrates
   that little debate exists that at a minimum physicians should possess
   not only knowledge but also a willingness to care for and comfort
   patients. The primacy of the patient in the physician's life is
   reflected in the panoply of oaths taken by new physicians despite great
   variability in other aspects of these oaths. The author details recent
   worrisome reports demonstrating the erosion of medical trainees' empathy
   and compassion by long work hours. Further, the continued linkage of
   these attitude changes and fatigue to poor medical outcomes is a call to
   action. Changes enacted by the Accreditation Council for Graduate
   Medical Education to reduce resident work hours are insufficient to
   achieve the goal of improved patient care while promoting moral
   development among resident physicians. The debate regarding resident
   work hours is often framed as an idealistic discussion of placing
   patients first. However, residents are used as an inexpensive labor
   force, and efforts to curtail this usage would have a significant
   economic impact. Economic concerns play a larger part in decision making
   than is generally discussed. The author calls for further alterations of
   resident work schedules to improve patient care and ensure the
   preservation of the moral ethos of medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Medical professionals are a community of highly educated individuals
   with a commitment to a core set of ideals and principles. This community
   provides both technical and ethical socialization. The development of
   ethical physicians is highly linked to experiences in the training
   period. Moral traits are situation-sensitive psychological and
   behavioral dispositions. The consequence of long duty hours on the moral
   development of physicians is less understood. The clinical environment
   of medical training programs can be so intense as to lead to conditions
   that may actually deprofessionalize trainees. The dynamic relationship
   between individual character traits and the situational dependence of
   their expression suggests that a systems approach will help promote and
   nurture moral development. Ethical behavior can be supported by systems
   that make it more difficult to veer from the ideal. Work hours limits
   are a structural change that will help preserve public safety by
   preventing physicians from taking the moral shortcuts that can occur
   with increasing work and time pressures. Work hours rules are beneficial
   but insufficient to optimize an ethical work and training environment.
   Additional measures need to be put in place to ensure that ethical
   tensions are not created between the patient's well-being and the
   resident's adherence to work hours rules. The ethical ideals of
   physician autonomy, selflessness, and accountability to the patient must
   be protected through the judicious and flexible use of work hours
   limits, physician extenders, census caps, nonteaching services, and
   high-quality handoffs.}},

   if the Sources of stress reported by medical and dental Students, both
   male and female, were due to common factors. A multivariate statistical
   analysis was also conducted to measure stress differences by year in
   school. Through factor analysis, the Survey question responses were
   grouped into five causal categories: academic performance. faculty
   relations, patient and clinic responsibilities, personal life issues,
   and professional identity. The overall findings show that dental
   Students had greater levels of stress than medical Students in three of
   the five categories. The only category in which medical Students
   demonstrated greater stress levels than dental Students was in
   professional identity. Measures of comparative levels of stress between
   male and female students for either profession did not demonstrate any
   significant differences. Stress levels related to clinical work varied

Abstract = {{Objective: To present a model of the medical consultation as a value
   chain, and to apply a neurobehavioral perspective to analyze each
   element in the chain with relevance for emotion regulation.
   Methods: Current knowledge on four elements in medical consultations and
   neuroscientific evidence on corresponding basic processes are
   selectively reviewed.
   Results: The four elements of communication behaviours presented as
   steps in a value chain model are: (1) establishing rapport, (2) patient
   disclosure of emotional Cues and concerns, (3) the doctor's expression
   of empathy, and (4) positive reappraisal of concerns.
   Conclusion: The metaphor of the value chain, with emphasis on goal
   orientation, helps to understand the impact of each communicative
   element on the outcome of the consultation. Added value at each step is
   proposed in terms of effects on outcome indicators; in this case
   patients affect regulation. Neurobehavioral mechanisms are suggested to
   explain the association between communication behaviour and affect
   regulation outcome.
   Practice implications: The value chain metaphor and the emphasis on
   behaviour-outcome-mechanisms associations may be of interest as
   conceptualizations for communications skills training. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: To establish sound empirical evidence that clinical empathy
   (abbreviated as CE) is a core element in the clinician-patient
   relationship with profound therapeutic potential, a substantial
   theoretical-based understanding of CE in medical care and medical
   education is still required. The two aims of the present paper are,
   therefore, (1) to give a multidisciplinary overview of the ``nature{''}
   and ``specific effectiveness{''} of CE, and (2) to use this base as a
   means of deriving relevant questions for a theory-based research agenda.
   Method: We made an effort to identify cut-rent and past literature about
   conceptual and empirical work focusing on empathy and CE, which derives
   from a Multiplicity of disciplines. We review the material in a
   structured fashion.
   Results: We describe the ``nature{''} of empathy by briefly Summarizing
   concepts and models from Sociology, psychology, social psychology,
   education, (social-)epidemiology, and neurosciences. To explain the
   ``specific effectiveness{''} of CE for patients, we develop the ``Effect
   model of empathic communication in the clinical encounter{''}, which
   demonstrates how an empathically communicating clinician can achieve
   improved patient outcomes. Both parts of theoretical findings are
   synthesized in a theory-based research agenda with the following key
   hypotheses: (1) CE is a determinant of quality in medical care, (2)
   clinicians biographical experiences influence their empathic behavior,
   and (3) CE is affected by situational factors.
   Conclusion: The main conclusions of our review are twofold. First of
   all, CE seems to be a fundamental determinant of quality in medical
   care, because it enables the clinician to fulfill key medical tasks more
   accurately, thereby achieving enhanced patient health outcomes. Second,
   the integration of biographical experiences and situational factors as
   determinants of CE in medical care and medical education appears to be
   crucial to develop and promote CE and ultimately ensuring high-quality
   patient care.
   Practice implications: Due to the complexity and multidimensionality of
   CE, evidence-based investigations of the derived hypotheses require both
   well-designed qualitative and quantitative studies as well as an
   interdisciplinary research approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Effective doctor-patient communication has been linked to
   numerous benefits for both patient and physician. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the University of Toronto's
   Therapeutic Communication Program (TCom) at improving first-year medical
   students' communication skills.
   Methods: Data were collected during the 1996/97, 1997/98, 1998/99 and
   1999/00 academic years. The study used a repeated measures design with a
   waiting list control group: students were randomly assigned to groups
   starting the educational intervention in either September (N = 38) or
   February (N = 41), with the latter being used as a control for the
   former. Communication skills were assessed at the pre-and
   post-intervention times and at the end of the academic year from the
   perspectives of student, standardized patient and external rater.
   Results: Only the external rater, using an instrument designed to assess
   the students' empathy based on their written responses, showed a time x
   group interaction effect (p = 0.039), thereby partially supporting the
   hypothesis that TCom improved the students' communication skills.
   Students rated themselves less positively after participation in the
   program (p = 0.038), suggesting that self-evaluation was an ineffective
   measure of actual performance or that the program helped them learn to
   more accurately assess their abilities.
   Conclusion: The lack of strong findings may be partly due to the study's
   small sample sizes. Further research at other medical or professional
   schools could assess the effectiveness of similar courses on students'
   communication skills and on other capacities that were not measured in
   this study, such as their understanding of and comfort with patients,
   their management of the doctor-patient relationship, and their ability
   to give and receive feedback.}},

Title = {{A qualitative study of patients' views on quality of primary care
   consultations in Hong Kong and comparison with the UK CARE Measure}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients' priorities and views on quality care are
   well-documented in Western countries but there is a dearth of research
   in this area in the East. The aim of the present study was to explore
   Chinese patients' views on quality of primary care consultations in Hong
   Kong and to compare these with the items in the CARE measure (a process
   measure of consultation quality widely used in the UK) in order to
   assess the potential utility of the CARE measure in a Chinese
   population.
   Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted on 21
   adult patients from 3 different primary care clinics (a public primary
   healthcare clinic, a University health centre, and a private family
   physician's clinic). Topics discussed included expectations,
   experiences, and views about quality of medical consultations.
   Interviews were typed verbatim, and a thematic approach was taken to
   identify key issues. These identified issues were then compared with the
   ten CARE measure items, using a CARE framework: Connecting (Care Measure
   items 1-3), Assessing (item 4), Responding (items 5,6), and Empowering
   (items 7-10).
   Results: Patients judged doctors in terms of both the process of the
   consultation and the perceived outcomes. Themes identified that related
   to the interpersonal process of the consultation fitted well under the
   CARE framework; Connecting and communicating (18/21 patients), Assessing
   holistically (10/21 patients), Responding (18/21 patients) and
   Empowering (19/21 patients). Patients from the public clinic, who were
   generally of lower socio-economic status, were least likely to expect
   holistic care or empowerment. Two-thirds of patients also judged doctors
   on whether they performed an adequate physical examination, and
   three-quarters on the later outcomes of consultation (in terms of relief
   or cure and/or side-effects of prescribed drugs).
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that Chinese patients in Hong Kong
   value engaged, empathic primary care doctors and judge the quality of
   consultations largely on these human skills and the attitudes and values
   that underpin them, as well as on the perceived outcomes of treatment.
   The match between themes relating to consultation process and the CARE
   Measure items suggests utility of this measure in this population, but
   further quantitative validation is required.}},

Abstract = {{The working alliance has been shown to be a consistent predictor of
   patient outcome and satisfaction in psychotherapy. This study examines
   the role of the working alliance and related behavioral indices in
   predicting medical outcome.
   Cognitive and emotional dimensions of the physician-patient relationship
   were examined in relation to patients' ratings of physician empathy,
   physician multicultural competence, perceived utility of treatment, and
   patients' adherence self-efficacy. These factors were then examined as
   part of a theoretical framework using path analyses to explain patient
   self-reported adherence to and satisfaction with treatment.
   The study was based on an ex-post facto field correlation design.
   One hundred fifty-two adult outpatients from a neurology clinic at
   Bellevue Hospital, a large municipal hospital in New York City,
   participated in the study.
   Surveys given to participants.
   We used the following measurements: Physician-Patient Working Alliance
   Scale, Perceived Utility Scale, Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale,
   Medical Outcome Study Adherence Scale, Physician Empathy Questionnaire,
   Physician Multicultural Competence Questionnaire, Medical Patient
   Satisfaction Questionnaire.
   The effect sizes for adherence are between 0.07 and 0.21 and for
   satisfaction between 0.10 to > 0.50. Regression and path analyses showed
   that ratings of physician multicultural competence and patient adherence
   self-efficacy beliefs predicted patient adherence (SB = 0.34) and (SB =
   0.30) and satisfaction (SB = 0.18) and (SB = 0.12), respectively.
   Working alliance ratings also predicted patient satisfaction (SB =
   0.49).
   Psychological and interpersonal dimensions of medical care are related
   to patient adherence and satisfaction. Medical care providers may be
   able to use these dimensions to target and improve health care outcomes.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Discussions of empathy in health care offer important ways of enabling
   communication and interpersonal connection that are therapeutic for the
   patient and satisfying for the physician. While the best of these
   discussions offer valuable insights into the patient-physician
   relationship, many of them lack an action component for alleviating the
   patient's suffering and emphasize the physician's experience of empathy
   rather than the patient's experience of illness.
   By examining educational methods, such as reflective writing exercises
   and the study of literary texts, and by analyzing theoretical approaches
   to empathy and suggestions for clinical practice, this article considers
   how to mindfully keep the focus on what the patient is going through.
   Clinical empathy can be improved by strategies that address (1) the
   patient's authority in providing first-person accounts of illness and
   disability, (2) expanding the concept of empathy to include an action
   component geared toward relieving patients' suffering, and (3) the
   potential value of extending empathy to include the social context of
   illness.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine how professional commitment influences patient
   safety and patient-perceived care quality.
   Design: Investigators for this Study used a cross-sectional design with
   questionnaires. A total of 348 pairs of nurses and inpatients were
   contacted at two medical centers in Taiwan during the period from August
   2007 to January 2008, yielding 284 pairs of completed questionnaires.
   Methods: Frequencies of six adverse patient events were used to measure
   patient safety; and the Service Quality Scale was used to measure
   patient-perceived care quality. Four items of the Professional
   Commitment Questionnaire were used to measure professional commitment.
   Regressions were used for the analyses.
   Findings: Professional commitment positively influenced overall patient
   safety (beta=.19, p=.00) and overall patient-perceived care quality
   (beta=.13, p=.03). Furthermore, professional commitment positively
   influenced all patient safety indicators (beta >=.12, p <=.04), except
   frequency of nosocomial infections, the coefficient of which reached
   borderline significance (beta=.11, p=.07). Professional commitment also
   positively influenced care quality ill terms of responsiveness(beta=.16,
   p=.01) and empathy (beta=.14, p=.03).
   Conclusions: Professional commitment may enhance patient safety and
   patient-perceived care quality. Clinical Relevance: This study indicates
   that nurse professional commitment can enhance patient safety and
   patient-perceived care quality.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{528-534}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient-centered communication skills, such as an empathic
   attitude towards patients and a holistic perspective on health, are
   difficult to acquire. Designing effective courses requires better
   understanding of the difficulties that students perceive with learning
   to talk with patients
   Aims: The study aimed at exploring students' common difficulties with
   learning patient-centered communication skills.
   Methods: Group discussions about student-patient interviews were
   videotaped and analyzed with regard to issues that students perceived as
   difficult and to their reflections about these difficulties.
   Results: The students reported feeling intrusive as they explored the
   patient's psychosocial situation. They avoided being empathic and felt
   insecure about coping adequately with emotionally loaded topics. Their
   difficulties were mainly due to insufficient understanding of the
   functional relations between psychosocial issues and health conditions.
   Moreover, students were insecure concerning the function of affective
   feedback in the diagnostic process. However, the group discussions
   generated a language for analyzing and structuring interviews that
   helped develop the students' professional identities.
   Conclusions: Students experienced moral qualms about applying major
   aspects of patient-centered interviewing. Instruction in communication
   skills should aim at filling the students' knowledge gaps and fostering
   their awareness and expression of emotional perceptions. Long-term
   relationships with patients could help develop patient-centered
   communication.}},

Title = {{Are medical students agreeable? An exploration of personality in
   relation to clinical skills training}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical competencies like trust, empathy, and cooperation
   are emphasized in medical school curricula. Agreeableness, a personality
   domain, reflects these competencies. It is unclear, however, whether
   medical student personality is intrinsically agreeable.
   Aim: We explored whether medical student personality reflects
   Agreeableness, and compared student Agreeableness with that of police
   officer recruits, a group in which high Agreeableness is not preferred.
   Methods: Students and recruits completed the Revised NEO Personality
   Inventory, which measures domains of the five-factor model: Neuroticism,
   Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.
   Results: Medical student Agreeableness was at average levels. Students
   were high in Extraversion and Openness, reflecting personal growth,
   leadership, problem solving, and influencing. Relative to recruits,
   students had higher Neuroticism and Openness and lower
   Conscientiousness. Agreeableness and Extraversion did not differ. Using
   discriminant analysis, Neuroticism, Openness, and Conscientiousness
   accurately classified 77\% of students and recruits.
   Conclusion: Medical students were not inordinately agreeable. They were
   ambitious, intellectually-creative problem solvers with a preference to
   direct/influence. Clinical skills training that acknowledges this style
   may enhance clinical education processes. Model-based methods for
   clinical skills-including agenda-setting, conflict resolution, and
   alliance making - that require mastery of techniques and have
   evidence-based relevance to patient care may be useful adjuncts to
   conventional clinical training.}},

Abstract = {{In ``Theory Is Personal,{''} Allen Siegel MD, a Chicago psychoanalyst
   and Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Rush University
   Medical Center, shares the very personal story of how he came to his
   theory. Sometimes we find our theory. Other times, Siegel argues, it is
   our theory that finds us. In this article Siegel catalogues his early
   encounters with figures-contemporary and real-from Sigmund Freud to
   influential department chairs to an analyst who would become legendary
   for introducing a bold new theory into the psychoanalytic canon.
   Charting key experiences that shaped his adoption of this new approach-a
   depression in response to his first patient, a clinical treatment with
   Heinz Kohut, and exposure to others who dared to challenge Freud-Siegel
   describes the theory that brought both himself and his patients to life.
   After outlining the principles that guide the new theory and practice
   known as self psychology, Siegel tells of the empathic ambiance that
   call now emerge in the consulting room. Finally, he shows how this new
   theory of human motivation provides not merely a rationale for
   psychotherapy but an explanatory apparatus for understanding human
   action ill the world beyond the consulting room. He turns to a brief
   study of aggression and war, as expressed in a 1932 correspondence
   between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, to illustrate how the
   understanding of aggression and war changes significantly when empathy
   is the field's data collecting instrument.}},

   Residents}},
Journal = {{TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{327-333}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   requires residency training programs to develop methods to teach and
   assess communication skills in residents to ensure competence as a
   practitioner. In response, we piloted a communication curriculum for
   emergency medicine residents. We describe the curriculum and suggest
   future directions for development based on the strengths and weaknesses
   of residents' performance and their reactions to the curriculum.
   Description: Twenty-six residents in a 3-year program at a
   university-affiliated county hospital participated. Curriculum
   components were an introductory session, a single standardized patient
   encounter using a locally written, unvalidated checklist assessing
   residents' communication skills, a videotape-facilitated
   self-assessment, and a private feedback session. Evaluation: Residents
   demonstrated greatest strengths in basic interpersonal skills and
   efficient information gathering and greatest weakness in empathy.
   Residents rated the curriculum favorably. Conclusion: The curriculum as
   implemented offers an initial foundation for teaching and learning
   critical care communication. Instruction in empathy requires
   improvement.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{723-733}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Narrative writing has been used to promote reflection and increased
   self-awareness among physicians. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the impact of prompted narrative writing on reflection.
   Thirty-two interns at 9 internal medicine residency programs
   participated in a year-long qualitative study about personal growth
   beginning in July of 2002. Interns wrote narratives every 8 weeks. At
   study completion, interns wrote a final narrative describing the affect
   that being in the study had on them. Responses were reviewed and
   organized into domains. Writing throughout the year resulted in
   reflection and encouraged interns to reconsider their core values and
   priorities. Some found that the exercise promoted greater self-awareness
   and provided an emotional outlet. Writing about difficult experiences
   coupled with reflection motivated some interns to want to improve.
   Prompted narrative writing led to reflection among interns and promoted
   self-awareness. Educators may consider incorporating narrative writing
   into residency education.}},
