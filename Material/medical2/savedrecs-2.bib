Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the effectiveness of motivational interviewing
   (MI) training among medical students.
   Methods: All students (n = 131) (year 5) at Lausanne Medical School,
   Switzerland were randomized into an experimental or a control group.
   After a training in basic communication skills (control condition), an
   8-h MI training was completed by 84.8\% students in the exprimental
   group. One week later, students in both groups were invited to meet with
   two standardized patients. MI skills were coded by blinded research
   assistants using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity 3.0.
   Results: Superior MI performance was shown for trained versus control
   students, as demonstrated by higher scores for ``Empathy{''} {[}p <
   0.001] and ``MI Spirit{''} {[}p < 0.001]. Scores were similar between
   groups for ``Direction{''}, indicating that students in both groups
   invited the patient to talk about behavior change. Behavior counts
   assessment demonstrated better performance in MI in trained versus
   untrained students regarding occurences of MI-adherent behavior {[}p <
   0.001], MI non-adherent behavior {[}p < 0.001], Closed questions {[}p <
   0.001], Open questions {[}p = 0.001], simple reflections {[}p = 0.03],
   and Complex reflections {[}p < 0.001]. Occurrences were similar between
   groups regarding ``Giving information{''}.
   Conclusion: An 8-h training workshop was associated with improved MI
   performance.
   Practice implications: These findings lend support for the
   implementation of MI training in medical schools. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose
   In addition to structural transformations, deeper changes are needed to
   enhance physicians' sense of meaning and satisfaction with their work
   and their ability to respond creatively to a dynamically changing
   practice environment. The purpose of this research was to understand
   what aspects of a successful continuing education program in mindful
   communication contributed to physicians' well-being and the care they
   provide.
   Method
   In 2008, the authors conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with
   primary care physicians who had recently completed a 52-hour mindful
   communication program demonstrated to reduce psychological distress and
   burnout while improving empathy. Interviews with a random sample of 20
   of the 46 physicians in the Rochester, New York, area who attended at
   least four of eight weekly sessions and four of eight monthly sessions
   were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively. The
   authors identified salient themes from the interviews.
   Results
   Participants reported three main themes: (1) sharing personal
   experiences from medical practice with colleagues reduced professional
   isolation, (2) mindfulness skills improved the participants' ability to
   be attentive and listen deeply to patients' concerns, respond to
   patients more effectively, and develop adaptive reserve, and (3)
   developing greater self-awareness was positive and transformative, yet
   participants struggled to give themselves permission to attend to their
   own personal growth.
   Conclusions
   Interventions to improve the quality of primary care practice and
   practitioner well-being should promote a sense of community, specific
   mindfulness skills, and permission and time devoted to personal growth.}},

   empathy in undergraduate nursing students Empathy and absence of
   prejudice and stigma are instrumental in facilitating effective
   nursepatient relations. This study assessed empathy levels and regard
   for specific medical conditions in undergraduate nursing students. A
   cross-sectional study was undertaken using paper-based versions of the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) and Medical Condition Regard
   Scale (MCRS), along with a brief set of demographic questions.
   Participants reported good empathy levels on JSPE. Attitudes towards
   intellectual disability, chronic pain, acute mental illness and terminal
   illness rated well on MCRS. Attitudes towards substance abuse, however,
   were lower. There were no significant differences between age groups,
   gender or year level of study. Overall results of this study were
   positive. Nursing students demonstrated acceptable empathy levels.
   Attitudes towards patients who abuse substances highlight an area that
   needs both further exploration and addressing. Attitudes towards mental
   health diagnoses were particularly favourable given that these often
   attract stigma and negative attitudes.}},

Title = {{Wish-fulfilling medicine in practice: a qualitative study of physician
   arguments}},

Abstract = {{There has been a move in medicine towards patient-centred care, leading
   to more demands from patients for particular therapies and treatments,
   and for wish-fulfilling medicine: the use of medical services according
   to the patient's wishes to enhance their subjective functioning,
   appearance or health. In contrast to conventional medicine, this use of
   medical services is not needed from a medical point of view. Boundaries
   in wish-fulfilling medicine are partly set by a physician's decision to
   fulfil or decline a patient's wish in practice. In order to develop a
   better understanding of how wish-fulfilling medicine occurs in practice
   in The Netherlands, a qualitative study (15 semistructured interviews
   and 1 focus group) was undertaken. The aim was to investigate the range
   and kind of arguments used by general practitioners and plastic surgeons
   in wish-fulfilling medicine. These groups represent the public funded
   realm of medicine as well as privately paid for services. Moreover, GPs
   and plastic surgeons can both be approached directly by patients in The
   Netherlands. The physicians studied raised many arguments that were
   expected: they used patient autonomy, risks and benefits, normality and
   justice to limit wish-fulfilling medicine. In addition, arguments new to
   this debate were uncovered, which were frequently used to justify
   compliance with a patient's request. Such arguments seem familiar from
   conventional medicine, including empathy, the patient-doctor
   relationship and reassurance. Moreover, certain arguments that play a
   significant role in the literature on wish-fulfilling medicine and
   enhancement were not mentioned, such as concepts of disease and the
   enhancement-treatment dichotomy and `suspect norms'.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical empathy is increasingly discussed in conventional and
   complementary medicine. Yet the term lacks an agreed conceptual base and
   definition. This article seeks to challenge preconceptions and stimulate
   conversation amongst the community of herbal practitioners, and beyond.
   It aims to contribute to consensus building around the meaning of
   clinical empathy and to the benefits it may offer practitioners,
   students and patients involved with the primary healthcare consultation.
   It is hoped that such an exploration will enable herbal practitioners to
   reflect on where they position themselves in a consultation and to what
   extent they integrate thoughts and feelings during their practice of the
   art and science of complementary medicine. The reading and experience as
   a medical herbalist and university learning facilitator led the author
   to the opinion that clinical empathy was a necessary clinical skill that
   has affective and cognitive aspects which can be developed, taught and
   integrated to improve the quality of patient healthcare. (C) 2012

Title = {{Comparative cross-sectional study of empathy among first year and final
   year medical students in Jimma University, Ethiopia: Steady state of the
   heart and opening of the eyes}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is general consent that empathy is crucial for the
   physician-patient relationship and thus an important issue in medical
   education. This comparative study was designed to examine the
   differences in empathy between first year and final year medical
   students in Jimma University, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study among 131 first year and
   106 final year medical students was conducted in Jimma University,
   Ethiopia on academic year 2010/11. The study subjects were selected
   using simple random sampling technique from the list of the students.
   Study participation was voluntary. The Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale
   (BEES) was used for the detection of ``heart-reading{''}, i.e. emotional
   empathy and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RME-R test) to
   evaluate ``mind-reading{''}, i.e. cognitive empathy. We performed t-test
   to compare the mean difference in empathy and RME-R scores between the
   two groups of students. A linear regression was computed to identify
   potential factors influencing the BEES and RME-R.
   Results: Out of the total 237 students, 207 (87.3\%) were males. The
   mean age of first year and final year students was 19.3 +/- 1.1 and 24.0
   +/- 1.4 years respectively. First year students have scored 40.6 +/-
   23.8 while final year students scored 41.5 +/- 20.8 mean in the BEES
   measuring emotional empathy score. However, this difference was not
   statistically significant (t = -0.30, df = 231, P-value >0.05). Final
   year students had significantly higher mean cognitive empathy score
   (17.8 +/- 4.5) than first year students (14.4 +/- 4.8) {[}beta = 2.7,
   95\%CI (1.20, 4.13)]. Males had scored lower cognitive {[}beta = -2.5,
   95\%CI (-4.37, -0.66)] and emotional empathy {[}beta = -12.0, 95\% CI
   (-21.66, -5.46)].
   Conclusions: Low emotional (BEES) and cognitive empathy sores were found
   in first year and final year students of Jimma University could have
   implications on the medical education curricula. Medical education
   targeted at enhancing emotional empathy and increasing cognitive empathy
   is required by segmenting with gender for effective physician-patient
   interaction. The influence of empathy on clinical competence should be
   studied using more rigorous design.}},

Title = {{``Explicitly implicit{''}: examining the importance of physician
   nonverbal involvement during error disclosures}},
Journal = {{SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{142}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY/PRINCIPLES: Medical errors are prevalent, but
   physicians commonly lack the training and skills to disclose them to
   their patients. Existing research has yielded a set of verbal messages
   physicians should communicate during error disclosures. However,
   considering the emotional message contents, patients likely derive much
   of the meaning from physicians' nonverbal behaviours. The purpose of
   this study was to test the causal effects of physicians' nonverbal
   communication on error disclosure outcomes.
   METHODS: At a university hospital in the Southeastern United States, 318
   patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. The first
   group watched a video vignette of a verbally and nonverbally competent
   error disclosure by a person acting as a physician. The second group was
   exposed to a verbally competent but nonverbally incompetent error
   disclosure. The third group read an error disclosure transcript. Then,
   all patients responded to measures of closeness, trust, forgiveness,
   satisfaction, distress, empathy, and avoidance.
   RESULTS: The results evidenced that holding the verbal message content
   constant, physician nonverbal involvement was significantly associated
   with higher patient ratings of closeness, trust, empathy, satisfaction,
   and forgiveness, and with lower ratings of patient emotional distress
   and avoidance. These associations were not affected by patient
   predispositions such as sex, ethnicity, religion and previous
   experiences with medical errors.
   CONCLUSION: The findings of this study imply that nonverbal
   communication has a significant impact on error disclosure outcomes and
   thus should be considered as an important component of future research
   and disclosure training efforts.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: In response to limitations in access to subspecialty care, I
   present personal observations and suggestions related to education of
   future pediatricians regarding development of critical thinking skills,
   care of complex and chronically ill patients, development of empathy,
   and restoration of responsibility that may help ameliorate this serious
   problem. Toward this end, I also offer 1 approach, a 24/7 telephone
   consultation network, for enriching interaction of primary care
   providers (PCPs) and subspecialists who can potentially provide rapid
   access to needed advice, reduce demand for subspecialty appointments,
   bolster decision-making and expertise, and realign resources with need.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from 579 requests by PCPs for telephone
   consultation by subspecialists in 8 areas (including child psychiatry).
   RESULTS: Of calls, 27\% took <5 minutes and 79\% took 5 to 15 minutes.
   Of calls, 28\% resulted in a clinic visit; 8\% prompted hospital
   transfer, hospital admission, or referral to an emergency department;
   and the remaining 64\% resulted in continued management by PCP with
   reinforcement of the plan. Assuming most inquiries would have resulted
   in referral to a subspecialist were there no telephone consultation, we
   estimated that 70\% (8+64\%) of consultations realigned resources with
   need, resulting in large saving of unnecessary clinic visits, travel,
   expense to families, lost days at work, or missed school.
   CONCLUSIONS: Development of rapid telephone consultation networks could
   provide increased access to care for those children in greatest need,
   use limited resources more efficiently, foster collegial and productive
   relationships between medical providers, and increase expertise of PCPs
   and subspecialists. Pediatrics 2012;129:961-967}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To use reflective writing to evaluate a new required palliative
   care experience for third year medical students.
   Method: The authors used a constant comparison method based on grounded
   theory to conduct a thematic analysis of reflective writings produced by
   third-year medical students completing a mandatory week-long clinical
   rotation in palliative care during academic year 2010 at the University
   of Louisville.
   Results: Two broad thematic categories were identified: what the
   students learned and what the students experienced. Student writings
   revealed learning about palliative care (pain management, family
   meetings, goals of care, patient-family centered care, timing of
   palliative care, and delivering bad news); being a doctor (knowledge,
   communication, presence, empathy, not giving false hope, and
   person-focused care); the patient (importance of family, the experience
   of dying, and the uniqueness of each patient); and themselves (need to
   be non-judgmental, ability to do palliative care, self-limitations,
   becoming a better physician, and dealing with death). Student
   reflections centered on encounters with patients and families, internal
   emotional responses, and self-transformation.
   Conclusions: Systematic analysis of reflective writing provides
   educators with valuable data about students' learning experiences. These
   results may inform the design and modification of the curriculum.}},

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Residency training is a challenging period in a physician's career owing
   to a multitude of stressors perhaps not previously encountered. In some
   cases, these stressors may culminate in a state of burnout. In response,
   much has been written about the issues of personal wellness during
   residency training. Recently, duty hours reform has been the major focus
   of addressing resident wellness; however, this intervention has
   established little benefit and has created unintended negative
   consequences. Alternatively, an emerging solution may be the
   implementation of resident wellness programs into residency training.
   Such programs are defined by a combination of active and passive
   initiatives targeting the various domains of physical, mental, social,
   and intellectual wellness. In contrast to duty hours reform, resident
   wellness programs are generally free from controversy and have been
   shown to improve resident wellness and enhance empathy.
   This article highlights the salient causes of burnout as it applies to
   present-day resident physicians and the patient care they provide.
   Moreover, in the wake of the controversy surrounding duty hours reform,
   a novel approach to resident wellness involving structured resident
   wellness programs is discussed. Specifically included are the
   fundamental components of a wellness program, the advantages held over
   duty hours reform, methods to evaluate program efficacy, and the current
   evidence to support these initiatives. Formal wellness curricula,
   including an evaluative process, should be an integral component of
   physician training. These programs represent a new hope in the solution
   to the long-debated issue of burnout and wellness during residency
   training.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, ``reflection{''} and ``reflective writing{''}
   have become familiar terms and practices in medical education. The
   authors of this article argue that the use of the terms requires more
   thoughtfulness and precision, particularly because medical educators ask
   students to do so much reflection and reflective writing. First, the
   authors discuss John Dewey's thoughts on the elements of reflection.
   Then the authors turn the discussion to composition studies in an effort
   to form a more robust conception of reflective writing. In particular,
   they examine what the discipline of composition studies refers to as the
   writing process. Next, they offer two approaches to teaching
   composition: the expressivist orientation and the critical/cultural
   studies orientation. The authors examine the vigorous debate over how to
   respond to reflective writing, and, finally, they offer a set of
   recommendations for incorporating reflection and reflective writing into
   the medical curriculum.}},

Title = {{Associations of Medical Student Personality and Health/Wellness
   Characteristics With Their Medical School Performance Across the
   Curriculum}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{476-485}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To assess the relationships of cognitive and noncognitive performance
   predictors to medical student preclinical and clinical performance
   indicators across medical school years 1 to 3 and to evaluate the
   association of psychological health/wellness factors with performance.
   Method
   In 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, correlational,
   retrospective study of all 175 students at the Saint Louis University
   School of Medicine who had just completed their third (first clinical)
   year. Students were asked to complete assessments of personality,
   stress, anxiety, depression, social support, and community cohesion.
   Performance measures included total Medical College Admission Test
   (MCAT) score, preclinical academic grades, National Board of Medical
   Examiners subject exam scores, United States Medical Licensing
   Examination Step 1 score, clinical evaluations, and Humanism in Medicine
   Honor Society nominations.
   Results
   A total of 152 students (87\%) participated. MCAT scores predicted
   cognitive performance indicators (academic tests), whereas personality
   variables (conscientiousness, extraversion, empathy) predicted
   noncognitive indicators (clinical evaluations, humanism nominations).
   Conscientiousness predicted all clinical skills, extraversion predicted
   clinical skills reflecting interpersonal behavior, and empathy predicted
   motivation. Health/wellness variables had limited associations with
   performance. In multivariate analyses that included control for shelf
   exam scores, conscientiousness predicted clinical evaluations, and
   extraversion and empathy predicted humanism nominations.
   Conclusions
   This study identified two sets of skills (cognitive, noncognitive) used
   during medical school, with minimal overlap across the types of
   performance (e.g., exam performance versus clinical interpersonal
   skills) they predict. Medical school admission and evaluation efforts
   may need to be modified to reflect the importance of personality and
   other noncognitive factors.}},

Title = {{General practitioners' management of mental disorders: A rewarding
   practice with considerable obstacles}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Primary care improvement is the cornerstone of current
   reforms. Mental disorders (MDs) are a leading cause of morbidity
   worldwide and widespread in industrialised countries. MDs are treated
   mainly in primary care by general practitioners (GPs), even though the
   latter ability to detect, diagnose, and treat patients with MDs is often
   considered unsatisfactory. This article examines GPs' management of MDs
   in an effort to acquire more information regarding means by which GPs
   deal with MD cases, impact of such cases on their practices, factors
   that enable or hinder MD management, and patient-management strategies.
   Methods: This study employs a mixed-method approach with emphasis on
   qualitative investigation. Based on a previous survey of 398 GPs in
   Quebec, Canada, 60 GPs representing a variety of practice settings were
   selected for further study. A 10-minute-long questionnaire comprising 27
   items was administered, and 70-minute-long interviews were conducted.
   Quantitative (SPSS) and qualitative (NVivo) analyses were performed.
   Results: At least 20\% of GP visits were MD-related. GPs were
   comfortable managing common MDs, but not serious MDs. GPs' based their
   treatment of MDs on pharmacotherapy, support therapy, and
   psycho-education. They used clinical intuition with few clinical tools,
   and closely followed their patients with MDs. Practice features (salary
   or hourly fees payment; psycho-social teams on-site; strong informal
   networks), and GPs' individual characteristics (continuing medical
   education; exposure and interest in MDs; traits like empathy) favoured
   MD management. Collaboration with psychologists and psychiatrists was
   considered key to good MD management. Limited access to specialists,
   system fragmentation, and underdeveloped group practice and shared-care
   models were impediments. MD management was seen as burdensome because it
   required more time, flexibility, and emotional investment. Strategies
   exist to reduce the burden (one-problem-per-visit rule; longer time
   slots). GPs found MD practice rewarding as patients were seen as
   grateful and more complying with medical recommendations compared to
   other patients, generally leading to positive outcomes.
   Conclusions: To improve MD management, this study highlights the
   importance of extending multidisciplinary GP practice settings with
   salary or hourly fee payment; access to psychotherapeutic and
   psychiatric expertise; and case-discussion training involving local
   networks of GPs and MD specialists that encourage both knowledge
   transfer and shared care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The interviews and interactions with patients are part of
   everyday health care provider. However, there is sometimes a difficulty
   in communication, linked to several factors. For this reason, the use of
   images to illustrate the medical conditions in the outpatient clinic can
   improve patient communication. We report our initial experience with the
   use of images to manage the quality of care to surigcal patients.
   Methodology: He used a computer to show pictures of the following
   conditions: surgery for an inguinal hernia, cholelithiasis,
   cholecystitis and the choledocholithiasis and finally thyroid pathology.
   Were randomized two groups of patients. Each of the affected patients in
   any stage of the disease, they explained their problems. In one of the
   groups also showed the patient was using the current image and continued
   to give appropriate explanations related to pathology. Thereafter,
   patients in both groups filled in an anonymous questionnaire in which
   they responded to what degree it was considered useful this methodology,
   and degree of satisfaction received outpatient treatment with or without
   the deployment of images by computer. We have analyzed the average time
   expected and made a visit.
   Results: 187 patients will be visited in the consultations over a period
   of 8 months. In 83 patients have been using images to give the
   explanations in external consultations. Of these, 24 patients suffering
   from thyroid, 24 hernias or incisional hernias and 35 patients with
   biliary tract pathology. Patients in the group were shown images of
   conditions have responded mostly be very satisfied with the use of
   images while the explanations are given on the patient's illness. Also,
   over 80\% of patients report being satisfied with this system. The
   visiting time was not lengthened.
   Discussion: Despite the existence of different variables that can
   influence patient satisfaction, use of images to illustrate surgical
   diseases to patients improves communication and flow of the explanations
   of the physician.
   Conclusions: The relationship doctor-patient communication is the key
   event in an outpatient setting. It determines a good overall result of
   the clinical interview. The use of images in an outpatient improves
   communication between patients and doctors. Moreover, the degree of
   satisfaction is high and the degree of understanding of the disease. It
   seems useful to incorporate in our outpatient clinic.}},

Title = {{Resident Physician Well-Being and Assessments of Their Knowledge and
   Clinical Performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Medical knowledge and clinical performance ratings are major
   criteria for assessing the competence of resident physicians. However,
   these assessments may be influenced by residents' mental health. The
   relationship between residents' well-being and empathy and assessments
   of their global performance remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether resident well-being and empathy are
   associated with assessments of their medical knowledge and clinical
   performance.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 730 clinical performance
   assessments completed by peers, supervising residents, and allied health
   professionals; 193 mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX)
   evaluations; and 260 in-training examinations (ITE) of Mayo Clinic
   internal medicine residents between January 2009 and August 2010.
   Multivariate generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate
   associations between residents' well-being and empathy and assessments
   of their knowledge and clinical performance.
   MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables were empathy using the Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index (IRI), burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory,
   depression using a standardized two-question screening instrument, and
   quality of life using a Linear Analog Self-Assessment item and the
   Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-8). Dependent variables were
   mini-CEX, ITE, and the validated six-item Mayo clinical performance
   assessment.
   RESULTS: 202 residents (64.7\%) provided both wellbeing and at least one
   category of assessment data. In multivariate models, residents' scores
   on the IRI empathy measure of ``the tendency to adopt the psychological
   view of others{''} were associated with higher peer ratings on
   ``desirability as a physician for a family member{''} (beta=0.023, 95\%
   CI=0.007-0.039, p=0.004). Additionally, burnout was associated with
   higher supervisor ratings of communication (beta=0.309, 95\%
   CI=0.100-0.517, p=0.004). There were no observed associations between
   ITE or mini-CEX scores and resident quality of life, burnout, fatigue,
   depression, or empathy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most dimensions of resident well-being were not associated
   with residents' knowledge scores and assessments of their clinical
   performance by other members of the health care team, which supports the
   trustworthiness of these measures. Nonetheless, correlations of resident
   empathy and burnout with assessments completed by peers and supervising
   residents suggest that some ratings of residents may be influenced by
   interpersonal factors.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT Empathy towards patients is associated with improved health
   outcomes. However, quantitative studies using self-reported data have
   not provided an in-depth opportunity to explore the lived experiences of
   medical students concerning empathy.
   OBJECTIVES This study was designed to investigate undergraduate medical
   students' experiences of the phenomenon of empathy during the course of
   their medical education and to explore the essence of their empathy.
   METHODS This was a descriptive, phenomenological study of medical
   student interviews conducted using the method of Colaizzi and Giorgi.
   The sample (n = 10) was drawn from medical students in Years 4 and 5.
   In-depth interviews were used to obtain a clear understanding of their
   experiences of empathy in the context of patient care. Interviews
   continued until no new information could be identified from transcripts.
   RESULTS Five themes were identified from analysis: the meaning of
   empathy; willingness to empathise; innate empathic ability; empathy
   decline or enhancement, and empathy education. Empathic ability was
   manifested through two factors: innate capacity for empathy, and
   barriers to displaying empathy. Different experiences and explanations
   concerning the decline or enhancement of empathy during medical
   education were explored.
   CONCLUSIONS Empathic ability was identified as an important innate
   attribute which nevertheless can be enhanced by educational
   interventions. Barriers to the expression of empathy with patients were
   identified. Role-modelling by clinical teachers was seen as the most
   important influence on empathy education for students engaged in
   experiential learning.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES This study aimed to examine concepts of altruism and empathy
   among medical students and professionals in conjunction with health care
   initiatives designed to support the maintenance of these qualities.
   METHODS We searched for the terms ` altruism', ` altruistic', `
   helping', ` prosocial behaviour' and ` empathy' in the Englishlanguage
   literature published from 1980 to the present within the Ovid MEDLINE,
   PsycInfo and PubMed databases. We used conceptual analysis to examine
   the relationships among altruism, empathy and related prosocial concepts
   in health care in order to understand how such factors may relate to
   emotional and career burnout, cynicism, decreased helping and decreased
   patient- centredness in care.
   RESULTS Altruistic ideals and qualities of empathy appear to decrease
   among some medical students as they progress through their education.
   During this process, students face increasingly heavy workloads, deal
   with strenuous demands and become more acquainted with non- humanistic
   informal practices inherent in the culture of medicine. In combination,
   these factors increase the likelihood that emotional suppression,
   detachment from patients, burnout and other negative consequences may
   result, perhaps as a means of self-preservation. Alternatively, by
   making a mindful and intentional choice to endeavour for self-care and a
   healthy work-life balance, medical students can uphold humanistic and
   prosocial attitudes and behaviours.
   CONCLUSIONS Promoting altruism in the context of a compensated health
   care career is contradictory and misguided. Instead, an approach to
   clinical care that is prosocial and empathic is recommended. Training in
   mindfulness, self-reflection and emotion skills may help medical
   students and professionals to recognise, regulate and behaviourally
   demonstrate empathy within clinical and professional encounters.
   However, health care initiatives to increase empathy and other
   humanistic qualities will be limited unless more practical and feasible
   emotion skills training is offered to and accepted by medical students.
   Success will be further moderated by the culture of medicine's full
   acceptance of empathy and humanism into its customs, beliefs, values,
   interactions and daily practices.}},

Abstract = {{When physicians interview patients with ambiguous or nonspecific
   symptoms, they often try to reassure them with the purpose of explaining
   that no dangerous illness or disease is causing the symptoms.
   Unfortunately the evidence suggests that patients with benign (back)
   pain instead feel misunderstood, frustrated and unsatisfied with the
   consultation. Validation is a communication method that focuses on
   understanding and empathy as a platform for problem solving and it may
   be applicable for interviews in medical settings. The aim of this study
   was to examine the effects of validation on patient satisfaction, pain
   and affect.
   To this end 28 nurses with (re) current back pain were recruited and
   randomly assigned to be interviewed in a validating or invalidating
   condition. Patient satisfaction, affect, pain, disability, pain
   catastrophizing, and fear of movement were assessed immediately after
   the interview.
   The results show that the participants in the validated group were more
   satisfied with the interview than participants in the invalidating
   condition. Moreover, they showed a significant decrease on all measures
   of negative affect as well as for pain. For example, there was a
   significant between group difference in frustration where frustration
   decreased in the validation group, while it increased in the
   invalidation condition.
   A validating communication style seems to be beneficial for enhancing
   patient satisfaction, as well as diminishing negative affect and pain
   intensity ratings. Our results suggest that validation might be a viable
   technique to use in clinical examinations of patients suffering pain.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Conceptualising the doctor-patient relationship as a `window
   mirror' exposes care delivery from doctor to self, doctor to patient,
   patient to self, and patient to doctor. These directions have not been
   measured concurrently. We aimed to develop and validate a patient
   questionnaire informed by this model.
   Methods: A modified-Delphi exercise was conducted to develop, and face
   and content validate, the questionnaire. Stage 2 surveyed 495 patients
   in general practice to assess the internal consistency and construct
   validity of the questionnaire.
   Results: The questionnaire is face and content valid. Its internal
   reliability and construct validity appear good. Patients who care more
   about their doctor also care more about themselves. A patient or doctor
   who cares about the other person is associated with increased self-care
   by that person.
   Conclusions: Further development and testing of the patient
   questionnaire is warranted to validate measurement of how patients
   perceive the caring they and their doctor give, and receive from, each
   other.
   Practice implications: From the patient perspective the questionnaire
   may increase awareness of the importance of family doctors and patients
   caring about each other and themselves. It may inform and evaluate
   medical students, educational programmes and caring in doctor-patient
   relationships. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In the German health system general practice has changed
   drastically in the past few years and patients' opportunities to get
   medical informations have increased significantly. In light of this,
   patients' needs in general practice should be reassessed.
   Patients and methods: 279 patients from 16 practices mainly in Hessen
   and Rhineland-Palatinate were interviewed. Using principal factor
   analysis, 51 questions about doctors were analyzed regarding possible
   dimensions of patient care needs.
   Results: The dimensions of patient care needs could be described with
   four scales: (1) social situation and emotional support, (2) the
   practitioner's expertise, explanations and information, (3) empathy and
   esteem for patients and (4) availability of the practitioner and care to
   chronic patients. In older age groups the importance of psychosocial
   care was emphasized as well as the practitioner's availability and care
   for patients with chronic diseases.
   Conclusion: Patient care needs are concentrated in four scales, which
   include psychosocial and continuous care and availability for patients
   with chronic diseases. These tasks should be further emphasized in
   medical education and also represented in the remuneration of
   practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Professionalism is a central tenet of the dental
   undergraduate curriculum. Dental undergraduate curricula and standards
   expect the dentist to put the patients interests first, and in this
   respect, an important attitude is empathy.
   Objective: This study examined the self-reported empathy levels of
   first-year dental students before and after an early analytical exposure
   to behavioural sciences and the clinical encounter.
   Method: First-year dental undergraduates were given an attitudinal
   questionnaire to complete before and after the behavioural science
   course. The questionnaire consisted of the HP version of the Jefferson
   Scale of Physician Empathy and the Patient-Practitioner Orientation
   Scale. Paired non-parametric tests and Spearman's Rho correlations,
   along with simple descriptive statistics, were used to test the
   statistical significance of observations.
   Results: A total of 66 paired questionnaires were returned, giving a
   response rate of 75\%. There were no correlations between age and total
   mean score of JSPE or PPOS, and no gender differences. There was a
   significant increase (P < 0.01) in empathy as measured by the JSPE
   between pre-and post-course scores. The PPOS did not record any
   significant change in the sharing, caring or total scale scores pre-to
   post-course.
   Conclusion: The modified JSPE has potential utility in assessing the
   cognitive-affective aspect of dental students' empathy. Using the JSPE,
   short-term measurable empathy changes can be detected in first-year
   dental undergraduates after the structured and assessed analytical
   introduction to the clinical encounter and environment.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. This article is a report of a study to determine the effect of an
   educational programme and to follow up weekly meetings on nurses and
   medical residents attitudes towards positive communication and
   collaboration. Background. Clear and appropriate communication and
   interdisciplinary collaboration is critical to the delivery of quality
   care. Collaborative practice among all healthcare professionals creates
   a positive work environment, decreases costs, improves job satisfaction
   among nurses and improves patient care, as well as decreasing patient
   morbidity and mortality. Poor communication and lack of teamwork or
   collaboration have been cited as persistent problems in healthcare.
   Method. The study was conducted in 2008 - 2009 at a hospital where a new
   medical residency programme was beginning and nurses had no prior
   experience working with medical residents. A quasi-experimental pre
   test, post-test design was used. The Jefferson Scale of Attitudes
   towards Physician-Nurse Collaboration and the Communication,
   Collaboration and Critical Thinking for Quality Patient Outcomes Survey
   tool measured the attitudes of 68 nurses and 47 medical residents in the
   areas of positive communication and collaboration. Results/Findings. The
   study demonstrates that a formal educational programme and follow-up
   discussions improved the attitudes of both nurses and medical residents
   on the Jefferson scale (medical residents t = 4.68, P = 0.001, nurses t
   = 4.37, P = 0.001) and on the communication scale (medical residents t =
   4.23, P = 0.001, nurses t = 4.13, P = 0.001). Conclusion. Continuing
   education for nurses, medical residents and other healthcare providers
   may assist in developing positive communication styles and promote
   collegiality and team work.}},

   exploratory, quantitative study conducted in a private hospital with a
   sample consisting of 288 users. Data collection occurred between April
   to July 2009, by means of a questionnaire and analysis using descriptive
   and inferential statistics. Results: We identified levels of user
   satisfaction, and the dimensions with the highest scores: security and
   reliability, and with lower scores, responsiveness and empathy. The
   nursing and medical teams had the highest scores. Conclusions: There is
   a need for intervention in the areas of nutrition and initial care.

Title = {{The trajectory to diagnosis with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a
   qualitative study}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the patient's experience of the trajectory to
   receiving a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and
   inform the provision of care for this patient group.
   Design: Qualitative study using in-depth one-to-one interviews and
   pictorial representations. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Setting: Participants were interviewed in their own homes across
   England.
   Participants: 30 patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (18
   participants were women, mean age 56 and range 26-80 years and time
   since diagnosis ranged from a few months to more than 12 years)
   participated.
   Results: All participants, regardless of the time since diagnosis,
   vividly described the process from manifestation of symptoms to
   receiving a confirmed diagnosis. The authors present data using three
   major themes: (i) making sense of symptoms, (ii) process of elimination
   and (iii) being diagnosed with PAH. Making sense of symptoms represented
   an early period of perseverance people tried to carry-on as usual
   despite `unexplained breathlessness'. As time progressed, this period
   was punctuated by critical events that triggered seeking medical advice.
   Once medical contact had been made, patients described a period of
   `elimination' and convoluted contact with the medical profession.
   Dyspnoea misdiagnosis was a key factor that delayed the PAH diagnosis.
   Diagnosis disclosure by some medical professionals was also viewed as
   lacking empathy. More positive experiences were relayed when the medical
   team disclosing the diagnosis acknowledged previous limitations.
   Conclusions: A lack of awareness of this illness from both the sufferer
   themselves and the medical profession emerged as a central theme and led
   to prolonged periods of being misdiagnosed. The application of a
   diagnostic pathway for unexplained dyspnoea that alerts practitioners to
   rare conditions could expedite the process of correct diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Interventions for providers to promote a patient-centred approach in
   clinical consultations}},
Journal = {{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{12}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Communication problems in health care may arise as a result of
   healthcare providers focusing on diseases and their management, rather
   than people, their lives and their health problems. Patient-centred
   approaches to care delivery in the patient encounter are increasingly
   advocated by consumers and clinicians and incorporated into training for
   healthcare providers. However, the impact of these interventions
   directly on clinical encounters and indirectly on patient satisfaction,
   healthcare behaviour and health status has not been adequately
   evaluated.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of interventions for healthcare providers that aim
   to promote patient-centred care (PCC) approaches in clinical
   consultations.
   Search methods
   For this update, we searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP),
   PsycINFO (OvidSP), and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) from January 2000 to June
   2010. The earlier version of this review searched MEDLINE (1966 to
   December 1999), EMBASE (1985 to December 1999), PsycLIT (1987 to
   December 1999), CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) and HEALTH STAR (1975 to
   December 1999). We searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for
   inclusion and contacted study authors to identify other relevant
   studies. Any study authors who were contacted for further information on
   their studies were also asked if they were aware of any other published
   or ongoing studies that would meet our inclusion criteria.
   Selection criteria
   In the original review, study designs included randomized controlled
   trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies,
   and interrupted time series studies of interventions for healthcare
   providers that promote patient-centred care in clinical consultations.
   In the present update, we were able to limit the studies to randomized
   controlled trials, thus limiting the likelihood of sampling error. This
   is especially important because the providers who volunteer for studies
   of PCC methods are likely to be different from the general population of
   providers. Patient-centred care was defined as a philosophy of care that
   encourages: (a) shared control of the consultation, decisions about
   interventions or management of the health problems with the patient,
   and/or (b) a focus in the consultation on the patient as a whole person
   who has individual preferences situated within social contexts (in
   contrast to a focus in the consultation on a body part or disease).
   Within our definition, shared treatment decision-making was a sufficient
   indicator of PCC. The participants were healthcare providers, including
   those in training.
   Data collection and analysis
   We classified interventions by whether they focused only on training
   providers or on training providers and patients, with and without
   condition-specific educational materials. We grouped outcome data from
   the studies to evaluate both direct effects on patient encounters
   (consultation process variables) and effects on patient outcomes
   (satisfaction, healthcare behaviour change, health status). We pooled
   results of RCTs using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative
   risks (RR) applying a fixed-effect model.
   Main results
   Forty-three randomized trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 29
   are new in this update. Inmost of the studies, training interventions
   were directed at primary care physicians (general practitioners,
   internists, paediatricians or family doctors) or nurses practising in
   community or hospital outpatient settings. Some studies trained
   specialists. Patients were predominantly adults with general medical
   problems, though two studies included children with asthma. Descriptive
   and pooled analyses showed generally positive effects on consultation
   processes on a range of measures relating to clarifying patients'
   concerns and beliefs; communicating about treatment options; levels of
   empathy; and patients' perception of providers' attentiveness to them
   and their concerns as well as their diseases. A new finding for this
   update is that short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful
   as longer training.
   The analyses showed mixed results on satisfaction, behaviour and health
   status. Studies using complex interventions that focused on providers
   and patients with condition-specific materials generally showed benefit
   in health behaviour and satisfaction, as well as consultation processes,
   with mixed effects on health status. Pooled analysis of the fewer than
   half of included studies with adequate data suggests moderate beneficial
   effects from interventions on the consultation process; and mixed
   effects on behaviour and patient satisfaction, with small positive
   effects on health status. Risk of bias varied across studies. Studies
   that focused only on provider behaviour frequently did not collect data
   on patient outcomes, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about
   the relative effect of intervention focus on providers compared with
   providers and patients.
   Authors' conclusions
   Interventions to promote patient-centred care within clinical
   consultations are effective across studies in transferring
   patient-centred skills to providers. However the effects on patient
   satisfaction, health behaviour and health status are mixed. There is
   some indication that complex interventions directed at providers and
   patients that include condition-specific educational materials have
   beneficial effects on health behaviour and health status, outcomes not
   assessed in studies reviewed previously. The latter conclusion is
   tentative at this time and requires more data. The heterogeneity of
   outcomes, and the use of single item consultation and health behaviour
   measures limit the strength of the conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Necker Hospital for Sick Children
   cares for severely ill newborn infants and children. Ethical dilemmas
   about whether to continue care, reduce or abandon treatment occur daily.
   A partnership with the parents represents an essential aspect of the
   medical and paramedical care provided. A psychologist intervenes in this
   context to support the health care personnel and to analyse the
   functioning of the system. A study was carried out to assess how useful
   family interviews were when announcing the worsening condition of the
   hospitalized child. The idea of re-enacting these interviews with the
   medical team which had been involved, led to a new way of conducting
   such interviews. The work of the staff members who had taken part in
   this re-enacting was assessed. Analysing these practices as well as
   listening to what the staff had to say during informal exchanges enabled
   the team to express their unvoiced concerns. Using such techniques,
   practices have been improved and in this paper, we propose to offer one
   theoretical elaboration of this point. The original role played here by
   a psychologist who is specifically devoted to listening to the staff of
   a highly specialised hospital service, dealing daily with vital, ethical
   questions, could well be continued and assessed at regular intervals.}},

Title = {{An exploration of empathy and correlates among Taiwanese nurses}},
Journal = {{JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{169-176}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Empathy is essential to optimal health care. The empathy of nurses,
   who make up the front line in patient care, merits particular attention.
   However, information on empathy among nurses is still limited. This
   study aimed to examine the nurses' empathy and correlates in Taiwan.
   Methods: The study used a cross-sectional correlational design with a
   convenience sampling method to recruit full-time nurses from a hospital
   in southern Taiwan between May and November of 2010. A structured
   questionnaire was used to gather data on respondents' demographic and
   job characteristics and included a Chinese version of the Jefferson
   Scale of Empathy. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, Pearson correlations,
   analysis of variance, and stepwise linear regression were used for
   analysis.
   Results: Of a total of 740 questionnaires that were distributed, 675
   valid copies were returned, for a response rate of 91.2\%. After the
   exclusion of 15 cases because of missing data, 660 participants were
   included for data analysis. The mean empathy score for entire
   participants was 110.66. Those who received empathy-related training,
   worked on a psychiatric ward, had children, and had more years of
   nursing work experience demonstrated significantly higher empathy
   scores. These four variables accounted for 22.0\% of the variance in
   empathy among participants.
   Conclusions: Our findings may help hospital administrators better
   understand the empathy level of nurses, and can serve as a reference in
   the design of appropriate in-service training to improve empathy among
   nurses.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{503-507}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many religions underline the value of merciful acts,
   especially the care of the sick. The aim of the survey was to verify the
   hypothesis that a higher religiosity correlates with a more desirable
   ethical attitude towards patients.
   Method: An anonymous questionnaire consisting of standardized tools:
   Scale of Attitudes towards the Patient (SAtP) (four dimensions: respect
   for autonomy, altruism, empathy and holistic approach to a patient), the
   Scale of Religious Attitudes (SReAt) evaluating the religiosity, and
   some questions related to the role of religious beliefs in respondents'
   professional lives. The research was carried out on a group of 528
   Polish physicians, 324 of whom returned the questionnaire (return =
   61\%); 51\% women, 49\% men; average work experience: 17.03 years; 93\%
   Catholics.
   Results: Religiosity correlates positively with altruism (r=0.12;
   p<0.05), holistic approach (r=0.18; p<0.01) and empathy (r=0.20;
   p<0.01), but not with respect for autonomy. For the majority of
   physicians, religious faith is an important supportive factor,
   especially in making difficult decisions. Surgeons are less religious
   (M=5.32; SD=1.06) than non-surgeons (M=5.61; SD=0.93); (t=-2.59,
   p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Physicians' religiosity is an essential factor shaping their
   attitude towards patients. The majority of physicians declared that
   their religious faith influences their professional decisions,
   especially in difficult situations. The religiosity variable explains
   physicians' moral attitude better than the denomination (religious
   affiliation) variable. Physician-patient relation frameworks should take
   into account not only patients' but also physicians' cultural and
   religious beliefs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To measure changes in pharmacy and medical students'
   physician-pharmacist collaboration scores resulting from a workshop
   designed to promote understanding of the others' roles in health care.
   Methods. More than 88\% of first-year pharmacy (n = 215) and medical (n
   = 205) students completed the Scale of Attitudes Toward
   Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration on 3 occasions in order to establish
   a baseline of median scores and to determine whether the scores were
   influenced by an interprofessional workshop.
   Results. Participation in the interprofessional workshop increased
   pharmacy students' collaboration scores above baseline (p=0.02) and
   raised the scores of medical students on the education component of the
   collaboration survey instrument (p=0.015). The collaboration scores of
   pharmacy students greatly exceeded those of medical students (p<0.0001).
   Conclusion. A workshop designed to foster interprofessional
   understanding between pharmacy and medical students raised the
   physician-pharmacist collaboration scores of both. Crucial practical
   goals for the future include raising the collaboration scores of medical
   students to those of pharmacy students.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between nurses and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients
   begins from the time of the selection of medical treatment for renal
   replacement therapy. There are various roles in this field that involve
   nurses, not only in providing technical guidance to patients but also in
   relaying dietary restrictions including those on fluid and diet, in
   providing information on public welfare for dialysis patients and in
   fostering interactions between the patient and doctors, nutritionists,
   social workers and medical support staff. The nurse plays an important
   role in the success of a PD training program. Only highly trained nurses
   should carry out PD training. The nurse trains the patient or a family
   member as a helper to perform PD. The ultimate goal is to make a plan to
   help the patient maintain his or her general condition and expand the
   quality of life by self-care. However, the most important role of nurses
   is to display empathy to the patient, that is, to put themselves in the
   patient's position, to foster an ongoing interaction between themselves
   and the patient and to listen to the patient and understand what is in
   the mind of the patient.}},

Title = {{Development of emotional intelligence in a team-based learning internal
   medicine clerkship}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{802-806}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although increasing number of articles have been published
   on team-based learning (TBL), none has explored team emotional
   intelligence.
   Aim: We extend the literature by examining changes in team emotional
   intelligence during a third year clerkship where TBL is a primary
   instructional strategy. We hypothesized that team emotional intelligence
   will change in a positive direction (i.e., increase) during the
   clerkship.
   Method: With IRB approval, during the 2009-2010 academic year third-year
   students in their internal medicine clerkship (N = 105, 100\% response
   rate) completed the Workgroup Emotional Intelligence Profile - Short
   Version (WEIP-S) at the beginning and at the end of their 12-week
   clerkship. TBL is an instructional strategy utilized during the internal
   medicine clerkship.
   Results: Paired t-tests showed that team emotional intelligence
   increased significantly pre to post clerkship for three of the four
   areas: awareness of own emotions (p = 0.018), recognizing emotions in
   others (p = 0.031), and ability to manage other's emotions (p = 0.013).
   There was no change for ability to control own emotions (p = 0.570).
   Conclusion: In an internal medicine clerkship, where TBL is utilized as
   an instructional strategy, team emotional intelligence increases. This
   supports TBL as an adjunctive tool to traditional medical education
   pedagogy.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to test hypothetical associations between
   personality dimensions and empathy scores in medical students. The
   Portuguese version of NEO-FFI was administered in order to characterize
   participants in terms of five personality traits: Neuroticism,
   Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, and
   Conscientiousness. Self-reported empathy measures were obtained with the
   Portuguese version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE-spv), a Likert-type questionnaire specifically developed for
   administration in health sciences settings that measures domains, such
   as compassionate care and perspective taking. Correlation analysis,
   multivariate analysis of covariance, and logistic regression analysis
   were conducted. The results confirmed positive associations between
   agreeableness, openness to experience and empathy, and did not support
   our hypothesis of negative associations between neuroticism and empathy.
   It is suggested that that the personality of students should be taken
   into account in programs to enhance empathy in undergraduate medical
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the meaning of
   ``positive attitude{''} for medical surgical nurses in caring for cancer
   patients. Methods: A qualitative method was used in this qualitative
   descriptive study with data from nurses who had volunteered to
   participate in an in-depth interview that was conducted between January
   and February 2012. A total of 10 nurses in general medical and surgical
   wards of a district hospital were interviewed. Results: The study used
   three broad themes to describe this multifaceted construct: showing
   empathy, seeing positively and behaving positively. The nurses were
   aware of their attitudes towards being positive with cancer patients and
   its significance in support for cancer patients. Conclusions: The
   findings of this study can serve as a platform upon which educational
   and other support programmes can be developed in order to meet the needs
   of those general nurses working with cancer patients. Future studies are
   recommended to examine nurses' beliefs about cancer that are thought to
   affect positive attitudes toward cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is an important element of professionalism in
   medicine. Thus, evaluation and enhancement empathy in physicians is
   important, regardless of geographical boundaries.
   Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the psychometrics of a Korean
   version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) among Korean
   physicians.
   Methods: The Korean version of JSPE was completed by 229 physicians in
   Korea.
   Results: Item-total score correlations were all positive and
   statistically significant. Cronbach's coefficient alpha was 0.84. The
   mean score was 98.2 (SD = 12.0), which was lower than that reported for
   American and Italian physicians. The emerged factor structure of the
   translated version was somewhat similar to that reported for American
   physicians, although the order was different. Significant differences in
   the mean empathy scores were observed between men and women and among
   physicians in different specialties.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence in support of reliability and
   construct validity of the Korean version of JSPE for assessing empathy
   among Korean physicians. The disparity between Korean physicians and
   physicians from other countries may be explained by differences in the
   culture of medical education and medical practice. It suggests an
   exploration of cross-cultural differences in physician empathy.}},

   communication skills training}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{E338-E348}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although communication skills training (CST) enhances
   patient-centred skills and attitudes, the literature indicates a
   problematic transfer of these from education into practice.
   Aim: We explored `lived' experiences of medical students and doctors to
   gain a better understanding of the impact of CST on patient-centredness
   in the transition to real practice.
   Methods: From a phenomenological perspective, we conducted 15 interviews
   and 11 focus groups with 4-9 participants/group (n=67) at two
   universities and carried out constant comparative analysis.
   Results: The gap between education and practice is the central
   phenomenon. Although CST raises students' communication awareness and
   self-efficacy in an `ideal' context, this paradoxically seems to
   jeopardize their ability to bridge the gulf. In addition, CST does not
   come to grips with students' attitudes. However, CST appears to be
   successful in equipping students with long-lasting `handles'. Yet
   students need more support to mould the provided `ideal' models into
   their own unique style of context-specific patient-centred behaviour.
   This implies: raising students' awareness of own attitudes and
   communication styles, offering a more realistic training ground,
   integrating CST with clinical experience and translating the
   primary-care-rooted concept of patient-centredness into various
   specialization contexts.
   Conclusion: CST could raise its impact by supporting students' recycling
   processes towards a personal style of context-sensitive
   patient-centredness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about medical students' perceptions of the
   factors that influence their academic performance.
   Aim: To detect factors medical students, in the final years of their
   undergraduate medical studies, believe affect their academic
   performance.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with high-achieving and
   re-sitting students in the final two years of their studies in a London
   medical school. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic
   content analysis was conducted. Similarities and differences in factors
   perceived to affect the academic performance of high-achieving and
   re-sitting students were identified.
   Results: Eight re-sitting and ten high-achieving students were
   interviewed. Three core themes were identified: engagement with
   learning; reflections on learning methods and experiences and the
   application of learning to future practice. High-achieving students
   showed a greater awareness of what worked in terms of their approaches
   to learning and coping with difficulty than re-sitting students. There
   were also differences in the degree of positive engagement with peers,
   suggesting the positive contribution of socialising with other medical
   students.
   Conclusions: This exploratory qualitative study identified attitudes,
   behaviours and motivations that appeared to contribute to success or
   failure at medical school. Our findings suggest ways to improve
   appraisal, remediation and support mechanisms for students.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Human dissection commonly occurs early in the undergraduate
   medical school curriculum, thus presenting an immediate opportunity for
   educators to teach and encourage humanistic qualities of respect,
   empathy, and compassion. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to
   measure the impact of the Donor Luncheon, a unique program in which
   medical students meet the families of the anatomical donor prior to
   dissection in the anatomy course at the University of Oklahoma College
   of Medicine. Methods: Students were randomized into groups of 8 to
   attend the luncheon and either met with family of the donor or attended
   the luncheon with no donor family present. A questionnaire measured
   students' attitudes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and at the conclusion of the
   anatomy course. Results: Factor analysis revealed 5 scales. Analysis
   revealed statistically significant differences across time for Donor as
   Person, Dissection Process, and Donor as Patient and statistically
   significant differences between groups for Donor as Person and Donor as
   Patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that this program can
   provide students with the opportunity to maintain more humanistic
   attitudes at the beginning of their medical education career.}},

   Results. Nursing and pharmacy students had significantly more empathy
   than did law students. Third-year pharmacy students scored higher on
   empathy than did first-year pharmacy students, whereas the converse was
   true for nurses. There was no significant difference in empathy between
   first-and third-year law students. Across the study years, empathy
   increased among pharmacy students, decreased among nurses, and remained
   the same among law students. Women scored higher on empathy than did
   males.
   Conclusions. Empathy scores among university students vary depending on

Title = {{Characterizing changes in student empathy throughout medical school}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{305-311}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important in the physician-patient relationship.
   Prior studies suggest that medical student empathy declines with
   clinical training.
   Aims: We examined the trend of empathy longitudinally; determined
   differences in empathy according to gender and medical specialty
   preferences; and determined empathy and career preference differences
   among students admitted through different medical school admission
   pathways.
   Method: The data for this study were collected using a longitudinal
   cohort design and included 2652 observations nested within 1162
   individuals. Participants were medical students at a university-based
   medical school surveyed yearly from 2007 through 2010. Empathy was
   measured by the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version
   (JSPE-S), a validated, 20-item self-administered questionnaire.
   Predictors of JSPE-S scores included gender, age, anticipated financial
   debt upon graduation and future career interest.
   Results: Empathy scores of students in preclinical years were higher
   than in clinical years. Gender was a significant predictor of empathy,
   with women having higher empathy scores than men. Students preferring
   technology-oriented specialties had lower empathy scores. When career
   preference was controlled, higher levels of debt were significantly
   associated with greater empathy. Students with high baseline empathy
   decreased less than students with low baseline empathy during medical
   school. Students in traditional four-year medical school programs had
   higher baseline empathy than those in early pathway programs.
   Conclusions: Self-reported empathy for patients, a possibly critical
   factor in high-quality patient-centered care, wanes as students advance
   in clinical training, particularly among those entering
   technology-oriented specialties. In the era of new health care policy
   and primary care shortages, our research may have implications for the
   medical education system and admission policy.}},

Abstract = {{Burnout is a psychological syndrome of emotional exhaustion,
   depersonalization, and impaired personal accomplishment induced by
   repeated workplace stressors. Current research suggests that physician
   burnout may have its origins in medical school. The consequences of
   medical student burnout include both personal and professional distress,
   loss of empathy, and poor health. We hypothesized that burnout occurs
   prior to the initiation of the clinical years of medical education. This
   was a cross-sectional survey administered to third-year medical students
   at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) in New York, New York (a
   traditional-style medical school with a marked division between
   pre-clinical and clinical training occurring at the beginning of the
   third year). Survey included an instrument used to measure job burnout,
   a sleep deprivation screen, and questions related to demographic
   information, current rotation, psychiatric history, time spent working/
   studying, participation in extracurricular activities, social support
   network, autonomy and isolation. Of the 86 medical students who
   participated, 71\% met criteria for burnout. Burnt out students were
   significantly more likely to suffer from sleep deprivation (p = 0.0359).
   They were also more likely to disagree with the following statements:
   ``I have control over my daily schedule'' (p = 0.0286) and ``I am
   confident that I will have the knowledge and skills necessary to become
   an intern when I graduate'' (p = 0.0263). Our findings show that burnout
   is present at the beginning of the third year of medical school, prior
   to the initiation of the clinical years of medical training. Medical
   student burnout is quite common, and early efforts should be made to
   empower medical students to both build the knowledge and skills
   necessary to become capable physicians, as well as withstand the
   emotional, mental, and physical challenges inherent to medical school.}},

   Medical Students}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To measure changes in pharmacy and medical students' empathy
   scores after a 40-minute workshop during which students observed and
   discussed a theatrical performance about the challenges of aging.
   Methods. First-year pharmacy and medical students (n = 187 and n = 183,
   respectively) participating in the workshop observed and discussed a
   10-minute performance in which students enacted problems and concerns
   faced by elderly patients. The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) was
   administered just prior to the workshop (pretest), immediately afterward
   (posttest 1), and 7 or 26 days afterward (posttest 2).
   Results. Empathy increased significantly from pretest to posttest 1 for
   students of each profession (p < 0.01). Improvement in empathy scores
   declined by the time the JSE was readministered to pharmacy students 7
   days later and to medical students 26 days later (posttest 2). Similar
   patterns of improved and declining empathy were found when the data were
   analyzed by gender and medical student specialty interest (ie, primary
   vs non-primary care specialties).
   Conclusion. Empathy scores increased but were not sustained for both
   pharmacy and medical students after a brief workshop on aging that
   required limited personnel resources.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although medical student specialty choices shape the future
   of the healthcare workforce, factors influencing changes in specialty
   preference during training remain poorly understood.
   Aim: To explore if medical student distress and empathy predicts changes
   in students' specialty preference.
   Methods: A total of 858/1321 medical students attending five medical
   schools responded to surveys in 2006 and 2007. The survey included
   questions about specialty choice, burnout, depression, quality of life,
   and empathy.
   Results: A total of 26\% (205/799) changed their specialty preference
   over 1 year. Depersonalization - an aspect of burnout - was the only
   distress variable associated with change in specialty preference (OR,
   odds ratio 0.962 for each 1-point increase in score, p=0.03). Empathy at
   baseline and changes in empathy over the course of 1 year did not
   predict change in specialty preference (all p>0.05). On multi-variable
   analysis, being a third year (OR 1.92), being male (OR 1.48), and
   depersonalization score (OR 0.962 for each point increase) independently
   predicted a change in specialty preference. Distress and empathy did not
   independently predict students' losing interest in primary care whereas
   being a fourth-year student (OR 1.83) and being female (OR 1.83) did.
   Conclusion: Among those who did have a major change in their specialty
   preference, distress and empathy did not play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To find out the views of the patient on their participation
   in decision making (DM) when visiting their family physician.
   Design: A cross-sectional, qualitative and quantitative study.
   Setting and participants: Patients attending their family doctors in
   diverse geographical Health Centres.
   Measurements: Personal interviewing using different kinds of questions
   (close-ended, close-ended with options and open-ended questions).
   Results: Patients participation: 658 (52+/-17.4 years, 62\% females,
   consulting with 97 doctors (from urban centres: 36 (458); rural centres:
   22 (200). Most patients (94\%; 620) declared to be satisfied with DM and
   up to 41\% (266) thought that DM should be taken only by the doctor.
   Nevertheless, after the consultation 60\% of patients (360) confirmed
   that they would have liked the physician to have asked them for their
   opinion, but the doctor did not encourage them to do this. Furthermore,
   patients considered information, discussion about options, ways to make
   decisions, medical advice, active listening and empathy as key aspects
   to encourage them to participate.
   Conclusions: After a medical consultation, most patients wanted to give
   their opinion about the proposals of treatment. Nevertheless, they felt
   that their doctors offered them these opportunities on very few
   occasions. Some types of questions are better than others in detecting
   of these kinds of needs, and are more useful to design strategies for
   involving patients in the DM process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All

Abstract = {{Background: Short-term medical missions are common in medical
   educational settings and could possibly affect student learning. Little
   research has been conducted about the potential of these missions on
   students' transformative learning, in particular as it relates to
   empathy and multicultural awareness.
   Methods: Eight podiatric medical students who participated in short-term
   medical missions in 2008 and 2009 completed an electronic survey to
   investigate the effect of their experience as it relates to their
   learning. The empathy and multicultural awareness impact of the mission
   experience was emphasized. Qualitative questions in the survey were
   coded, themed, and triangulated with the quantitative responses.
   Results: Six students (75\%) ``strongly agreed{''} that participating in
   the medical mission was a significant positive experience in their
   podiatric medical training. Six students felt that their experiences in
   serving these communities increased their personal awareness of
   multicultural/diversity needs in general. All of the students agreed
   that they will become better podiatric physicians because of their
   experiences in the medical missions. The qualitative data also indicate
   that the experience had an effect on the students' views of health care
   and increased empathy toward their patients.
   Conclusions: Short-term medical missions could play a significant role
   in the transformative learning experience in podiatric medical
   education. This could affect the empathy and multicultural awareness of
   podiatric medical students. Further and more extensive evaluations of
   the potential impact of short-term medical missions in podiatric medical
   education should be explored because it could influence curriculum and
   global health in the field of podiatric medicine. (J Am Podiatr Med

Title = {{Verbal and non-verbal behavior of doctors and patients in primary care
   consultations - How this relates to patient enablement}},
Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the relationship between observable patient and
   doctor verbal and non-verbal behaviors and the degree of enablement in
   consultations according to the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) (a
   patient-reported consultation outcome measure).
   Methods: We analyzed 88 recorded routine primary care consultations.
   Verbal and non-verbal communications were analyzed using the Roter
   Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) and the Medical Interaction Process
   System, respectively. Consultations were categorized as patient- or
   doctor-centered and by whether the patient or doctor was verbally
   dominant using the RIAS categorizations.
   Results: Consultations that were regarded as patient-centered or
   verbally dominated by the patient on RIAS coding were considered
   enabling. Socio-emotional interchange (agreements, approvals, laughter,
   legitimization) was associated with enablement. These features, together
   with task-related behavior explain up to 33\% of the variance of
   enablement, leaving 67\% unexplained. Thus, enablement appears to
   include aspects beyond those expressed as observable behavior.
   Conclusion: For enablement consultations should be patient-centered and
   doctors should facilitate socio-emotional interchange. Observable
   behavior included in communication skills training probably contributes
   to only about a third of the factors that engender enablement in
   consultations.
   Practice implications: To support patient enablement in consultations,
   clinicians should focus on agreements, approvals and legitimization
   whilst attending to patient agendas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An empathic relationship between caregiver and patient not only defines
   the quality of the patient's experience as a recipient of care, it also
   contributes to patient outcomes. This longitudinal study was designed to
   examine changes in empathy during an academic year among undergraduate
   nursing students. Participants were 214 undergraduate nursing students
   who completed the Jefferson Scale of Empathy at the beginning and at the
   end of 2006-2007 academic year. Statistical analyses showed a
   statistically significant decline of empathy for nursing students who
   were exposed more than others to patient encounters during study period
   (F(2, 211)= 4.2, p < 0.01). Findings are consistent with those found
   among medical students in that nursing students' encounters with
   patients which ironically are supposed to strengthen empathic engagement
   have shown a decline in student empathy. Suggestions for improving
   empathic behaviors in nursing students are discussed.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) is a type of social intelligence
   that involves monitoring, discriminating between and using emotions to
   guide thinking and actions. EI is related to interpersonal and
   communication skills, and is important in the assessment and training of
   medical undergraduates.
   Aim: This review aimed to determine the impact of structured educational
   interventions on the EI of medical students.
   Methods: We systematically searched 14 electronic databases and hand
   searched high yield journals. We looked at changes in EI and related
   behaviour of medical students, assessed using Kirkpatrick's hierarchy,
   provided they could be directly related to the content of the
   educational intervention.
   Results: A total of 1947 articles were reviewed, of which 14 articles
   met the inclusion criteria.
   Conclusions: The use of simulated patients is beneficial in improving EI
   when introduced in interventions later rather than earlier in
   undergraduate medical education. Regardless of duration of intervention,
   interventions have the best effects when delivered: (1) over a short
   space of time; (2) to students later in their undergraduate education
   and; (3) to female students. This should be taken into account when
   designing and delivering interventions. Emphasising the importance of
   empathetic qualities, such as empathetic communication style should be
   made explicit during teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To demonstrate a quantitative abstraction method for
   Communication Quality Assurance projects to assess physicians'
   communication about hidden emotions after newborn genetic screening.
   Design: Communication quality indicator analysis.
   Setting: Standardized parent encounters performed in practicing
   physicians' clinics or during educational workshops for residents.
   Participants: Fifty-nine pediatrics residents, 53 pediatricians, and 31
   family physicians.
   Intervention: Participants were asked to counsel standardized parents
   about a screening result; counseling was recorded, transcribed, and
   parsed into statements (each with 1 subject and 1 predicate). Pairs of
   abstractors independently compared statements with a data dictionary
   containing explicit-criteria definitions.
   Outcome Measures: Four groups of ``precautionary empathy{''} behaviors
   (assessment of emotion, anticipation/validation of emotion, instruction
   about emotion, and caution about future emotion), with definitions
   developed for both ``definite{''} and ``partial{''} instances.
   Results: Only 38 of 143 transcripts (26.6\%) met definite criteria for
   at least 1 of the precautionary empathy behaviors. When partial criteria
   were counted, this number increased to 80 of 143 transcripts (55.9\%).
   The most common type of precautionary empathy was the ``instruction
   about emotion{''} behavior (eg, ``don't be worried{''}), which may
   sometimes be leading or premature.
   Conclusions: Precautionary empathy behaviors were rare in this analysis.
   Further study is needed, but this study should raise concerns about the
   quality of communication services after newborn screening.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of emotional intelligence (EI), a model that encompasses all
   of the skills in the patient-doctor relationship, has been applied to
   medical education in recent years. Doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology
   (O\&G) often deal with emotionally demanding situations for themselves
   and for their patients, and therefore, EI skills may be vital and should
   be part of any training curriculum. Using novel methodology, 16 O\&G
   consultants from across the North-West of England were asked to
   investigate (using a coding manual) randomly allocated modules of the
   RCOG O\&G training curriculum, to look for constructs of EI and these
   were found both implicitly and explicitly, highlighting the importance
   of EI to O\&G. By focussing on EI training within the curriculum, to
   improve the patient-doctor relationship, patient satisfaction may be
   increased and litigation reduced in a specialty that is already highly
   litigious.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Little is known about the frequency and occurrence of
   patients' negative emotional cues and concerns (NECC) across specialties
   in hospital departments.
   Methods: Ninety-six consultations were videotaped in a general hospital.
   The VR-CoDES (Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences) were
   used to code the patients' NECC. Cohen's kappa was used to establish
   reliability between coders.
   Results: Cohen's kappa was above 0.60. NECC were observed in more than
   half of the consultations. The number of NECC in the consultations was
   163, with 109 negative emotional cues and 54 concerns. The mean number
   of NECC in the consultations was 1.69, with a median of 1. The first
   NECC in consultations were stated after a median duration of 5 min 21 s.
   We could not find significant differences related to the gender and age
   of the patient or the physician, or the specialty of the physician.
   Conclusions: More than half of the concerns were not preceded by a
   negative emotional cue. Few consultations contained more than 3 NECC,
   and NECC tended to be expressed relatively early. Practice implications:
   Patients' expressions of emotional issues are few, and most of them are
   subtle. Physicians should be thoroughly trained to identify and respond
   to them. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is a substantial body of research on inter-human empathy
   and inter-animal empathy, there is a dearth of research competing
   humans' empathic reactions to humans and animals. To address this issue,
   three experiments were conducted in which participants read a scenario
   about a human or animal abuse victim in need of medical attention, and
   indicated the degree of empathy they had on an emotional response scale.
   In Experiment 1, women had significantly more empathy for animals than
   for humans, whereas men tended to express more empathy for humans than
   for animals. In Experiment 2, adult women expressed the same degree of
   empathy for a child as for a puppy. Similarly, in Experiment 3, adult
   men and women expressed the same degree of empathy for a baby as for a
   puppy. Overall, results indicated that people feel at least as much
   empathy for animals as for humans. We suggest that an animal target
   elicits a great deal of empathy partly because it is perceived as not
   being responsible for having caused the need situation. Future research
   will show whether empathy for animals translates to prosocial behavior
   toward them as well.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effects and challenges of being a
   simulated patient (SP) in a high-stakes clinical examination context in
   a regional setting.
   Design: Mixed methods, using a written survey, focus groups, and a
   retrospective postal survey.
   Setting: A university clinical school in a Victorian regional city.
   Participants: Nineteen SP volunteers (from an existing database of 55
   people) who had been involved in midyear, summative Objective Structured
   Clinical Examination (OSCE) role-play performances.
   Main outcome measures: Challenges of the OSCE roleplay experience and
   the reported effects on SPs. The implications of these factors have an
   impact on the sustainability of SP programs in regional settings.
   Results: Physical and emotional effects like exhaustion were reported,
   as well as empathy and concern for the medical students. The
   retrospective postal survey indicated that the SPs had no long-term
   negative effects from their high-stakes examination experiences.
   Participants also reported that a level of decision making and
   improvisation was needed in the performance of their OSCE role plays.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals the complexity and demands on SPs in
   performing in high-stakes clinical examinations. The results highlight
   that SP roles involve more than the transfer of scripted information.
   SPs should be considered as members of the examination team when
   preparing and implementing high-stakes examinations to assist in
   maintaining standardised performance during and across OSCE role plays.
   Relationships between SPs and educational institutes need to be nurtured
   to ensure that the ability to continue highstakes OSCEs in a regional
   setting is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is prevalent in clinical settings, and yet it is relatively
   under-represented in the education of most students in the health
   professions. Because pain includes both sensory-discriminative and
   affective features, teaching students about pain presents unique
   challenges and opportunities. The present article describes the
   evolution of a new blueprint for clinical excellence that, among other
   competencies, incorporates a need for the emotional development of
   clinical trainees. The framework has been applied to the development and
   implementation of two new courses in pain. The first course is designed
   to provide a comprehensive foundation of medical knowledge regarding
   pain, while integratively introducing students to the affective
   dimensions of pain. The second course is designed to enhance students'
   appreciation for the protean effects of pain through use of the
   humanities to represent medical experience. It is concluded that, to be
   most effective, fostering the emotional development of trainees in the
   health professions necessitates the incorporation of affect-focused
   learning objectives, educational tasks and assessment methods.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study evaluated a Web-based tool to help patients with
   schizophrenia communicate with clinicians about evidence-based
   treatments. Methods: Fifty patients used an interactive Web-based
   intervention featuring actors simulating a patient discussing treatment
   concerns (intervention group; N=24) or were shown an educational video
   about schizophrenia treatment before an appointment for routine
   follow-up care (control group; N=26). The visits were recorded and
   analyzed by using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Results: Visits
   by patients in the intervention group were longer (24 versus 19 minutes,
   p<.05) and had a proportionately greater patient contribution to the
   dialogue (288 versus 229 statements, p<.05) and a smaller ratio of
   clinician to patient talk (1.1 versus 1.4, p<.05) compared with visits
   by the control group. Patients in the intervention group asked more
   questions about treatment (2 versus .9, p<.05), disclosed more lifestyle
   information (76 versus 53 statements, p<.005), and more often checked
   that they understood information (3.6 versus 2.1 checks, p<.05).
   Clinicians asked more questions about treatment (7.5 versus 5.1, p<.05)
   and the medical condition (7.8 versus 4.7, p<.05) to control group
   patients but made more statements of empathy (1.3 versus .4, p<.03) and
   cues of interest (48 versus 22, p<.05) with the intervention group. The
   patient-centeredness ratio was greater for visits by patients in the
   intervention group than by the control group (8.5 versus 3.2, p<.05).
   Patients' tone was more dominant and respectful (p<.05) and clinicians'
   tone was more sympathetic (p<.05) during visits by patients in the
   intervention. Conclusions: The Web-based tool empowered persons with

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In the primary care setting, use of the BATHE (Background,
   Affect, Trouble, Handling, and Empathy) method of interviewing has been
   shown to increase patient satisfaction. This technique is a brief
   psychotherapeutic method used to address patients' physical and
   psychosocial problems. The BATHE technique has not been evaluated in the
   perioperative setting as a way of improving patient satisfaction. In
   this study, we sought to determine whether satisfaction could be
   enhanced by use of the BATHE technique during the preoperative
   evaluation by anesthesiologists.
   METHODS: Fifty cardiac and 50 general surgery patients were interviewed
   in the preanesthesia clinic (PAC) of an academic hospital. They were
   randomly enrolled in the BATHE group or the control group and asked to
   complete an anonymous satisfaction survey after their visit. This survey
   was modified from current studies and not validated elsewhere. The
   relative influence of the BATHE condition was examined as it pertained
   to interview duration, patient satisfaction, and patient report of the
   BATHE items being asked.
   RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of patients approached by the study group
   voluntarily enrolled. Patients interviewed using the BATHE method
   reported being asked about all BATHE questions significantly more often
   than control patients: t(98) = 19.10, P = 0.001 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 2.59, 3.20). Patients in the BATHE group were more
   satisfied with their visit to the PAC than those in the control group:
   t(98) = 5.37, P = 0.001 (95\% CI = 0.19, 0.41). The use of the BATHE
   method did not significantly increase the amount of time physicians
   spent evaluating patients: t(98) = 0.110, P = 0.912 (95\% CI = -1.519,
   1.359).
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of the BATHE method in an academic medical center's
   cardiac and general PAC showed promising results in this preliminary
   study. A validated and fully developed survey instrument is needed
   before we can convincingly conclude that the BATHE method is an
   effective way of improving patient satisfaction. (Anesth Analg

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The study of narrative has become increasingly important in the
   humanities and social sciences and there is a growing use of narrative
   in the clinical domains of medicine and psychotherapy. Narrative
   psychiatry is also on the rise and promises to help psychiatry be
   responsive to increasing critical concerns from inside and outside the
   field.
   Recent findings
   The field of narrative is vast and cuts across a variety of disciplines.
   Contemporary scholars in narrative medicine build on 30 years of work in
   medical humanities and bioethics to rigorously understand human
   variables in medicine and to improve physician empathy. Narrative
   psychotherapists have developed a new model of psychotherapy and a
   meta-narrative theory of diverse mental health interventions.
   Psychiatrists have picked up these insights and are finding them
   invaluable for navigating contemporary issues in psychiatry.
   Summary Narrative theory has become important in the humanities, social
   sciences, medicine, and psychotherapy for understanding human meaning
   making. Increasingly, the tools of narrative are proving valuable for
   psychiatry as well. Narrative psychiatry does not negate or supersede
   other knowledge and research in psychiatry, but it can help psychiatry
   understand how people use psychiatric knowledge, among other cultural
   resources, for making sense of psychic difficulties and psychic
   differences.}},

Title = {{Stability of empathy among undergraduate medical students: A
   longitudinal study at one UK medical school}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important to patient care. The prevailing view is
   that empathy declines during university medical education. The
   significance of that decline has been debated.
   This paper reports the findings in respect of two questions relating to
   university medical education:
   1. Do men and women medical students differ in empathy?
   2. Does empathy change amongst men and women over time?
   Methods: The medical course at the University of Cambridge comprises two
   components: Core Science (Years 1-3) and Clinical (Years 4-6). Data were
   obtained from repeated questionnaire surveys of medical students from
   each component over a period of four years: 2007-2010. Participation in
   the study was voluntary.
   Empathy was measured using two subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index: IRI-EC (affective empathy) and IRI-PT (cognitive empathy). We
   analysed data separately for men and women from the Core Science and
   Clinical components. We undertook missing value analyses using logistic
   regression separately, for each measure of empathy, to examine
   non-response bias. We used Student's t-tests to examine gender
   differences and linear mixed effects regression analyses to examine
   changes over time. To assess the influence of outliers, we repeated the
   linear mixed effects regression analyses having excluded them.
   Results: Women displayed statistically significant higher mean scores
   than men for affective empathy in all 6 years of medical training and
   for cognitive empathy in 4 out of 6 years - Years 1 and 2 (Core Science
   component) and Years 4 and 5 (Clinical component).
   Amongst men, affective empathy declined slightly during both Core
   Science and Clinical components. Although statistically significant,
   both of these changes were extremely small. Cognitive empathy was
   unchanged during either component. Amongst women, neither affective
   empathy nor cognitive empathy changed during either component of the
   course.
   Analysis following removal of outliers showed a statistically
   significant slight increase in men's cognitive empathy during the Core
   Science component and slight decline in women's affective empathy during
   the Clinical component. Again, although statistically significant, these
   changes were extremely small and do not influence the study's overall
   conclusions.
   Conclusions: Amongst medical students at the University of Cambridge,
   women are more empathetic than men (a generally observed phenomenon).
   Men's affective empathy declined slightly across the course overall,
   whilst women's affective empathy showed no change. Neither men nor women
   showed any change in cognitive empathy during the course. Although
   statistically significant, the size of such changes as occurred makes
   their practical significance questionable. Neither men nor women appear
   to become meaningfully less empathetic during their medical education at
   the University of Cambridge.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. A number of milestones in the treatment of premature
   ejaculation (PE) have occurred over the past five decades, including the
   development of various behavioral and cognitive techniques as well as
   pharmacotherapies that modify neurophysiological processes involved in
   ejaculation. Nevertheless, the notion that sexual responses such as PE
   are influenced by physiological, psychobehavioral, cultural, and
   relationship factors is as valid now as it was 50 years ago, and
   therefore, interventions should consider all such domains in the
   development of effective treatment strategies.
   Aim. Provide an overview of which patients with PE are suitable to
   receive psychosexual treatment and the psychological approaches for
   managing this disorder.
   Methods. Review of the literature.
   Main Outcome Measure. Psychosexual treatments that integrate behavioral,
   psychological, and relationship functioning.
   Results. PE is typically a couple's problem and, therefore,
   psychotherapy is best when the partner is involved. Before embarking on
   psychotherapy, the clinician should obtain a medical history pertaining
   to sexual-, psychological-, and relationship-related factors, so that
   the treatment strategy can be tailored to the needs of the individual.
   General strategies underpinning integrative, ``process-oriented{''}
   elements of psychotherapy most relevant to PE are: developing the
   therapist-patient relationship; expressing empathy, genuineness, and
   positive regard; motivational interviewing, i.e., developing motivation
   to change; developing discrepancy; working through resistance;
   identifying PE-related affect, cognitions, and behaviors (including
   interaction with partners); and supporting self-efficacy. The four main
   domains that encompass psychotherapy techniques specific to the
   treatment of PE are: behavioral; cognitive; affective; and relational.
   Sustained positive outcomes in PE may be obtained using a combination
   treatment strategy that addresses all elements of PE, including
   psychological and biological factors.
   Conclusions. Psychosexual treatments may help the patient with PE and
   his partner to address their sexual problems and improve their overall
   relationship. The effects of psychosexual therapy may be augmented by
   combining this intervention with pharmacotherapy. Rowland D and Cooper

Abstract = {{Many medical schools have incorporated experiences with representational
   or figurative art into the curriculum in an effort to improve learners'
   powers of observation, visual diagnostic skills, and pattern recognition
   skills or to enhance communication skills, foster teamwork, and/or
   improve empathy. The Keck School of Medicine of the University of
   Southern California has partnered with Los Angeles' Museum of
   Contemporary Art to design an educational experience with the goal of
   honing students' abilities to observe, describe, and interpret complex
   information. The authors discovered that through a constructivist
   approach to viewing and discussing nonrepresentational, contemporary
   art, students were able not only to apply their observational and
   interpretive skills in a safe, nonclinical setting but also to accept
   the facts that ambiguity is inherent to art, life, and clinical
   experience and that there can be more than one answer to many questions.
   This intervention, entailing extensive guided inquiry, collaborative
   thinking, and process work, has allowed students and faculty to reflect
   on the parallel processes at work in clinical practice and art
   interpretation. In patient encounters, physicians (and
   physicians-in-training) begin with attention and observation, continue
   with multiple interpretations of that which they observe, move to
   sorting through often ambiguous evidence, proceed to collaboration
   within a community of observers, and finally move to consensus and
   direction for action. In the worlds of both art and medicine,
   individuals imagine experiences beyond their own and test hypotheses by
   integrating their own prior knowledge and intuition and by comparing
   their evidence with that of others.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Job burnout is prevalent among U. S. internal medicine (IM) residents
   and may lead to depression, suboptimal patient care, and medical errors.
   This study sought to identify factors predicting new burnout to better
   identify at-risk residents.
   Method
   The authors administered surveys to first-year IM residents at five
   institutions twice between June 2008 and June 2009, linking individual
   pre- and postresponses. Surveys measured job burnout, sleepiness,
   personality traits, and other characteristics. Burnout was defined using
   the most commonly identified definition and another stricter definition.
   Results
   Of 263 eligible residents, 185 (70\%) completed both surveys. Among 114
   residents who began free of burnout and completed both surveys, 86
   (75\%) developed burnout, with no differences across institutions. They
   were significantly more likely to report a disorganized personality
   style (9 versus 0; 11\% versus 0\%; P = .019) and less likely to report
   receiving regular performance feedback (34 versus 13; 63\% versus 87\%;
   P = .057). Using a stricter definition, 50\% (78/156) of residents
   developed burnout. They were less likely to plan to pursue subspecialty
   training (49 versus 63; 78\% versus 93\%; P = .016) or have a calm
   personality style (59 versus 70; 77\% versus 90\%; P = .029). There were
   no significant associations between burnout incidence and duty hours,
   clinical rotation, demographics, social supports, loan debt, or
   psychiatric history.
   Conclusions
   This study identified a high burnout incidence. The associations
   observed between burnout incidence and personality style, lack of
   feedback, and career choice uncertainty may inform interventions to
   prevent burnout and associated hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Student participation in service activities during medical school is
   believed to enhance student professionalism and empathy. Yet, there are
   no studies that measure medical student empathy levels in relation to
   service activities.
   Method
   Medical students from four classes (2007-2010) were surveyed at
   graduation using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student
   Version and questions about service activity during medical school. For
   two classes, empathy scores were also obtained at orientation. The data
   were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Means
   comparison tests were performed.
   Results
   Mean empathy scores at graduation were higher for students who
   participated in service activities compared with those who reported no
   service (115.18 versus 107.97, P < .001). At orientation, students with
   no service had lower empathy scores, and those with any service had
   higher empathy scores.
   Conclusions
   Student empathy and service activities during medical school are
   related. This may have implications for admissions committees.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates patients' expectations and perceptions of
   service quality in public dental health care and measures their
   ``satisfaction gap.{''} This descriptive study involved 481 dental
   outpatients in Kelantan, Malaysia. A modified SERVQUAL 20-item
   instrument was used to assess patients' expectations before and
   perceptions after receiving dental treatment. The ``satisfaction gap{''}
   was then measured. Results showed that patients visiting for management
   of dental pain were more satisfied (P = .007) than those visiting with
   appointment. The most significant service quality dimensions were
   related to responsiveness, assurance, and empathy of the dental health
   care providers. There was a significant difference between the patients'
   expectations and their perceptions of service provided (P < .01) with
   regard to all dimensions. In conclusion, dental service providers should
   give emphasis to the compassionate and emotional aspects of care and to
   remember that they are integral components of quality service.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the contribution of agency to neural processing involved
   in aggression and morality, participants viewed in the MRI scanner a
   series of short visual scenarios in which an individual was either
   intentionally harming another person or easing the other's pain. They
   were required to mentally simulate being the perpetrator or the
   recipient of those actions. Functional connectivity analyses demonstrate
   that positive agency (easing the pain of another) was associated with
   increased activity in ventral striatum, while negative agency (harming
   the other) resulted in a strong signal decrease in the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and activation in the amygdala. Overall, our data show
   that explicit perspective taking strategy has profound impact on the
   neural recruitment associated with distinct behaviors as well as their
   moral consequences. Results from this study can inform new strategies
   both for therapeutic interventions for patients with socioemotional
   disorders and the education of medical practitioners. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study is to generate empirically based `tips'
   from lay people on how medical consultations could become more
   successful from a patient perspective.
   Methods: 258 Lay people in the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium and the
   Netherlands, distributed over 32 focus groups, were invited to formulate
   `tips' for doctors as well as patients after rating the quality of
   communication from videotaped consultations and discussing their
   arguments in focus groups.
   Results: Tips were remarkably similar across the four countries. Most
   tips reflect the professional literature, such as the importance of
   nonverbal communication, personal attention and empathy, but also
   addressed issues as how to deal with new technologies and new
   accessibility arrangements (triage). The tips were targeted to the
   consultation itself, its preparation and the aftercare. Tips for doctors
   were mirrored in tips for patients.
   Conclusion: Lay people seem to be competent in participating in
   quality-of-care debates. They are well aware of patients' own
   responsibilities. Besides, they have clear opinions about novel
   technology and healthcare arrangements (triage).
   Practice implications: Listening to patients, showing empathy and
   personal attention seem to have a universal value. Doctors should be
   trained to practice these behaviors, healthcare managers in involving
   patients in practice reorganisations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Literature indicates a decline in patient-centredness in
   medical students, especially during clinical clerkships. We examined the
   impact of preclinical communication skills training (CST) on students'
   development of patient-centred attitudes and attitudes toward CST during
   clerkships.
   Methods: We prospectively compared two cohorts before and after
   clerkships: one cohort (n = 48) had not received CST, whereas the other
   (n = 37) had received a five-year CST. We assessed the impact using five
   validated questionnaires.
   Results: Communication trained students slightly but significantly
   declined in patient-centred attitudes (3/4 scales) and attitudes toward
   CST during clerkships, whereas the scores of the untrained students
   remained stable (5/5 scales). Both cohorts did not differ in attitudes
   before clerkships. In the trained cohort, males mostly showed a sharper
   decline than females. In the total group (n = 85), females demonstrated
   higher attitude scores toward CST, and in 1/4 scales measuring
   patient-centred attitudes.
   Conclusion: This cohort study suggests that CST might make students more
   vulnerable to decline in attitude scores during clerkships.
   Practice implications: These remarkable findings, contrary to what
   educators would expect to result from their efforts, challenge medical
   education to address the new questions that are raised about the
   validity of the questionnaires, the impact of CST and the learning
   processes involved in the development of patient-centredness. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Objective: A relatively unexplored aspect of clinicians' communication
   skill is their interpersonal sensitivity, or ability to perceive their
   patients accurately with regard to patients' feelings, desires,
   intentions, needs, physical states, personality, attitudes, beliefs, and
   values. The present article argues for the importance of this skill in
   clinical interactions and summarizes supportive research.
   Methods: Reviews approaches to measuring interpersonal sensitivity and
   research on correlates of clinicians' and laypersons' interpersonal
   sensitivity.
   Results: Studies on clinicians' interpersonal sensitivity suggest that
   this skill could be improved. Furthermore, there are important
   correlates of clinicians' interpersonal sensitivity, including, on the
   patient's side, satisfaction, appointment-keeping adherence, and
   learning of conveyed information, and, on the clinician's side,
   awareness of patients' cues of anxiety and distress, commitment to
   patient-centered values, self-reported awareness of own emotions, and
   female gender. Furthermore, a very large non-clinical literature points
   to many other correlates of interpersonal sensitivity that are relevant
   to the clinical situation, including empathy, prosocial behavior, skill
   in negotiating, selling, teaching, and managing, better personal
   adjustment, and better interpersonal relationships. Research also
   suggests that interpersonal sensitivity is a trainable skill that could
   realistically be included in clinical education.
   Conclusion: Clinicians' interpersonal sensitivity is an important
   component of quality of care and deserves further research.
   Practice implications: This important skill should be incorporated into
   training programs to improve clinician-patient communication. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Objective: Patients express their negative emotions in medical
   consultations either implicitly as cue to an underlying unpleasant
   emotion or explicitly as a clear, unambiguous concern. The health
   provider's response to such cues and concerns is important for the
   outcome of consultations. Yet, physicians often neglect patient's
   negative emotions. Most studies of this subject are from primary health
   care. We aimed to describe how physicians in a hospital respond to
   negative emotions in an outpatient setting.
   Methods: Ninety six consultations were videotaped in a general teaching
   hospital. The Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences was used
   to identify patients' expression of negative emotions in terms of cue
   and concern and to code physicians' subsequent responses. Cohen's kappa
   was used as interrater reliability measure. Acceptable kappa level was
   set to .60.
   Results: We observed 163 expressions of negative emotions. In general,
   the physician responses to patients' cues and concerns did not include
   follow up or exploration. Concerns more often than cues led to lack of
   emotional exploration.
   Conclusions: When patients expressed negative emotions or cues to such,
   hospital physicians tended to move away from emotional communication,
   particularly if the emotion was expressed as an explicit concern.
   Practice implications: Medical training should enable physicians' to
   explore the patients' emotions in situations where it will improve the
   medical treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Medical communication is goal oriented behavior. As such, it
   can be modeled as a chain of decisions, resulting from cognitive and
   emotional processes each potentially associated with psychophysiological
   reactions. Psychophysiological may be helpful to detect small changes in
   affect or arousal in the course of a consultation that would be
   difficult to detect by other evaluations of the process, like
   self-reports.
   The question is how psychophysiological communication research should be
   modeled for unraveling in more detail the cognitive, emotional and
   interpersonal processes which underlie physician and patient behavior.
   Methods: In the world of medical communication research the six-function
   model of medical communication reveals a number of fundamental
   perceptual, cognitive and emotional processes which may evoke
   psychophysiological responses. The world of psychophysiological research
   encompasses domains of perception, mental imagery, anticipation and
   action which all have close connections with fundamental tasks in
   communication.
   Conclusion: This paper discusses ten methodological issues in linking
   continuous psychophysiological data to verbal and nonverbal events in a
   medical consultation observed with the Verona coding system.
   Practice implications: When linking the two worlds of research, the
   methodological challenges discussed need to be solved to obtain a valid
   and reliable application of psychophysiological measures in medical
   communication research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Leadership is the ability to guide a team adequately, to ensure that it
   will be able to completely develop a given project. Being a leader means
   having the capacity of active Listening and exercising a wide variety of
   communicational aptitudes. Leading means working together, and
   facilitating that work. A leader needs to have in-depth self-knowledge
   as well as a good share of humility and internal coherence. The
   development of many of these features is essential to ameliorate both
   patient-doctor relationships and professional relationships in the
   modern day-to-day medical practice. Even though not all of us are
   destined to lead work teams, there is a common obligation to exercise
   many of the skills that a leader should have. (C) 2011 Elsevier Espana,

Title = {{Vocation and avocation: leisure activities correlate with professional
   engagement, but not burnout, in a cross-sectional survey of UK doctors}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sir William Osler suggested in 1899 that avocations (leisure
   activities) in doctors are related to an increased sense of vocation
   (professional engagement) and a decreased level of burnout. This study
   evaluated those claims in a large group of doctors practicing in the UK
   while taking into account a wide range of background variables.
   Methods: A follow-up questionnaire was sent to 4,457 UK-qualified
   doctors who had been included in four previous studies of medical school
   selection and training, beginning in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1989/1991. A
   total of 2,845 (63.8\%) doctors returned the questionnaire. Questions
   particularly asked about work engagement, satisfaction with medicine as
   a career, and personal achievement (Vocation/engagement), stress,
   emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (BurnedOut), and 29
   different leisure activities (Avocation/Leisure), as well as questions
   on personality, empathy, work experience, and demography.
   Results: Doctors reporting more Avocation/Leisure activities tended to
   be women, to have older children, to be less surface-rational, more
   extravert, more open to experience, less agreeable, and to fantasize
   more. Doctors who were more BurnedOut tended to be men, to be more
   sleep-deprived, to report a greater workload and less choice and
   independence in their work, to have higher neuroticism, lower
   extraversion and lower agreeableness scores, and to have lower
   self-esteem. In contrast, doctors with a greater sense of
   Vocation/engagement, tended to see more patients, to have greater choice
   and independence at work, to have a deep approach to work, to have a
   more supportive-receptive work environment, to be more extravert and
   more conscientious, and to report greater self-esteem. Avocation/Leisure
   activities correlated significantly with Vocation/engagement, even after
   taking into account 25 background variables describing demography, work,
   and personality, whereas BurnedOut showed no significant correlation
   with Avocation/Leisure activities. Popular Culture and High Culture did
   not differ in their influence on Vocation/engagement, although there was
   a suggestion that Depersonalization was correlated with more interest in
   Popular Culture and less interest in High Culture.
   Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study there is evidence, even after
   taking into account a wide range of individual difference measures, that
   doctors with greater Avocation/Leisure activities also have a greater
   sense of Vocation/Engagement. In contrast, being BurnedOut did not
   relate to Avocation/Leisure activities (but did relate to many other
   measures). Osler was probably correct in recommending to doctors that,
   `While medicine is to be your vocation, or calling, see to it that you
   also have an avocation'.}},

Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Professionalism topics are usually not covered as a separate
   lesson within formal curriculum, but in subtler and less officially
   recognized educational activities, which makes them difficult to teach
   and assess. Interactive methods (e. g. movies) could be efficient
   teaching methods but are rarely studied. The aims of this study were: 1)
   to test the relevance and usefulness of movies in teaching
   professionalism to fourth year medical students and, 2) to assess the
   impact of this teaching method on students' attitudes towards some
   professionalism topics.
   Method: This was an education study with qualitative data analysis in a
   group of eleven fourth year medical students from the Medical School of
   University Maribor who attended an elective four month course on
   professionalism. There were 8 (66.7\%) female students in the group. The
   mean age of the students was 21.9 +/- 0.9 years. The authors used
   students' written reports and oral presentations as the basis for
   qualitative analysis using thematic codes.
   Results: Students recognised the following dimensions in the movie:
   communication, empathy, doctors' personal interests and palliative care.
   It also made them think about their attitudes towards life, death and
   dying.
   Conclusions: The controlled environment of movies successfully enables
   students to explore their values, beliefs, and attitudes towards
   features of professionalism without feeling that their personal
   integrity had been threatened. Interactive teaching methods could become
   an indispensible aid in teaching professionalism to new generations.}},

Title = {{Psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis of the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy towards patients is considered to be associated with
   improved health outcomes. Many scales have been developed to measure
   empathy in health care professionals and students. The Jefferson Scale
   of Physician Empathy (JSPE) has been widely used. This study was
   designed to examine the psychometric properties and the theoretical
   structure of the JSPE.
   Methods: A total of 853 medical students responded to the JSPE
   questionnaire. A hypothetical model was evaluated by structural equation
   modelling to determine the adequacy of goodness-of-fit to sample data.
   Results: The model showed excellent goodness-of-fit. Further analysis
   showed that the hypothesised three-factor model of the JSPE structure
   fits well across the gender differences of medical students.
   Conclusions: The results supported scale multi-dimensionality. The 20
   item JSPE provides a valid and reliable scale to measure empathy among
   not only undergraduate and graduate medical education programmes, but
   also practising doctors. The limitations of the study are discussed and
   some recommendations are made for future practice.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We hypothesized that patients' ratings of physician empathy
   (PE) would be higher among those with private health insurance (PHI,
   referring to financial incentive) than among patients with statutory
   health insurance (SHI).
   Methods: A postal survey was administered to 710 cancer patients. PE was
   assessed using the Consultation-and-Relational-Empathy measure. T-tests
   were conducted to analyse whether PHI and SHI-patients differ in their
   ratings of PE and variables relating to contact time with the physician.
   Structural-equation-modelling (SEM) verified mediating effects.
   Results: PHI-patients rated physician empathy higher. SEM revealed that
   PHI-status has a strong significant effect on frequency of talking with
   the physician, which has a strong significant effect (1) on PE and (2)
   has a moderate effect on patients' perception of medical staff stress,
   thereby also affecting patients' ratings of PE.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PHI-status is one necessary
   precondition for physicians spending more time with the patient.
   Spending more time with the PHI-patient has two major effects: it
   results in a more positive perception of PE and positively impacts
   PHI-patients' perception of medical staff stress, which in turn, again
   influences PE.
   Practical implications: Health policy should discuss these findings in
   terms of equality in receiving high-quality care. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Medical Students' Self-Reported Empathy and Simulated Patients'
   Assessments of Student Empathy: An Analysis by Gender and Ethnicity}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine the contribution of students' gender and ethnicity to
   assessments by simulated patients (SPs) of medical students' empathy,
   and to compare the results with students' self-assessments of their own
   empathy.
   Method
   In 2008, the authors used three different tools to assess the empathy of
   248 third-year medical students. Students completed the Jefferson Scale
   of Physician Empathy (JSPE), and SPs completed the Jefferson Scale of
   Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE) and a global rating of
   empathy (GRE) in 10 objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)
   encounters.
   Results
   Of the 248 students who completed an end-of-third-year OSCE, 176 (71\%)
   also completed the JSPE. Results showed that women scored higher than
   men on all three measures of empathy. The authors detected no
   significant difference between white and Asian American students on
   their self-report JSPE scores. However, the SPs' assessments on the
   JSPPPE and on the GRE were significantly lower, indicating less empathy,
   for Asian American students.
   Conclusions
   A tool for SPs to assess students' empathy during an OSCE could be
   helpful for unmasking some deficits in empathy in students during the
   third year of medical school. Because the authors found no significant
   differences on self-reported empathy, the differences they observed in
   the SPs' assessments of white and Asian American students were
   unexpected and need further exploration. These findings call for
   investigation into the reasons for such differences so that OSCEs and
   other examinations comply with the guidelines for fairness in
   educational and psychological testing as recommended by professional
   testing organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To develop instruments for measuring empathic and sympathetic
   orientations in patient care and to provide evidence in support of their
   psychometrics.
   Method
   Third-year medical students at Jefferson Medical College responded to
   four clinical vignettes in 2010. For each vignette, students indicated
   the extent of their agreement with an empathic response (conveying their
   understanding of patients' concerns) and with a sympathetic response
   (sharing patients' feelings). The authors calculated, based on students'
   responses to the clinical vignettes, two measures of empathic and
   sympathetic orientation. Students also completed the Jefferson Scale of
   Empathy (JSE) and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).
   Results
   Of the 258 students in the class, 201 (78\%) responded to all four
   vignettes and completed the JSE and IRI. The authors confirmed construct
   validity of the measures of empathic and sympathetic orientation through
   factor analysis. The empathic orientation was significantly associated
   with the measure of empathy (as measured by the JSE) but not with
   measures of sympathy (as measured by specific scales of the IRI).
   Conversely, sympathetic orientation was significantly associated with
   measures of sympathy. Thus, these results support the validity of the
   empathic and sympathetic orientation measures as assessed by four
   clinical vignettes. Coefficient alphas for the two measures were,
   respectively, 0.79 and 0.84.
   Conclusions
   The validated measures of empathic and sympathetic orientation provide
   research opportunities to enhance the understanding of the contributions
   of empathy and sympathy to physicians' competence and patient outcomes.}},

Title = {{Empathy Decline and Its Reasons: A Systematic Review of Studies With
   Medical Students and Residents}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Empathy is a key element of patient-physician communication; it is
   relevant to and positively influences patients' health. The authors
   systematically reviewed the literature to investigate changes in trainee
   empathy and reasons for those changes during medical school and
   residency.
   Method
   The authors conducted a systematic search of studies concerning trainee
   empathy published from January 1990 to January 2010, using manual
   methods and the PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. They
   independently reviewed and selected quantitative and qualitative studies
   for inclusion. Intervention studies, those that evaluated psychometric
   properties of self-assessment tools, and those with a sample size <30
   were excluded.
   Results
   Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria: 11 on medical students and
   7 on residents. Three longitudinal and six cross-sectional studies of
   medical students demonstrated a significant decrease in empathy during
   medical school; one cross-sectional study found a tendency toward a
   decrease, and another suggested stable scores. The five longitudinal and
   two cross-sectional studies of residents showed a decrease in empathy
   during residency. The studies pointed to the clinical practice phase of
   training and the distress produced by aspects of the ``hidden,{''}
   ``formal,{''} and ``informal{''} curricula as main reasons for empathy
   decline.
   Conclusions
   The results of the reviewed studies, especially those with longitudinal
   data, suggest that empathy decline during medical school and residency
   compromises striving toward professionalism and may threaten health care
   quality. Theory-based investigations of the factors that contribute to
   empathy decline among trainees and improvement of the validity of
   self-assessment methods are necessary for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Understanding how the information needs of cancer patients
   (CaPts) vary is important because met information needs affect health
   outcomes and CaPts' satisfaction. The goals of the study were to
   identify subgroups of CaPts based on self-reported cancer-and
   treatment-related information needs and to determine whether subgroups
   could be predicted on the basis of selected sociodemographic, clinical
   and clinician-patient relationship variables.
   Methods Three hundred twenty-three CaPts participated in a survey using
   the ``Cancer Patients Information Needs{''} scale, which is a new tool
   for measuring cancer-related information needs. The number of
   information need subgroups and need profiles within each subgroup was
   identified using latent class analysis (LCA). Multinomial logistic
   regression was applied to predict class membership.
   Results LCA identified a model of five subgroups exhibiting differences
   in type and extent of CaPts' unmet information needs: a subgroup with
   ``no unmet needs{''} (31.4\% of the sample), two subgroups with ``high
   level of psychosocial unmet information needs{''} (27.0\% and 12.0\%), a
   subgroup with ``high level of purely medical unmet information needs{''}
   (16.0\%) and a subgroup with ``high level of medical and psychosocial
   unmet information needs{''} (13.6\%). An assessment of sociodemographic
   and clinical characteristics revealed that younger CaPts and CaPts'
   requiring psychological support seem to belong to subgroups with a
   higher level of unmet information needs. However, the most significant
   predictor for the subgroups with unmet information needs is a good
   clinician-patient relationship, i.e. subjective perception of high level
   of trust in and caring attention from nurses together with high degree
   of physician empathy seems to be predictive for inclusion in the
   subgroup with no unmet information needs.
   Conclusions The results of our study can be used by oncology nurses and
   physicians to increase their awareness of the complexity and
   heterogeneity of information needs among CaPts and of clinically
   significant subgroups of CaPts. Moreover, regression analyses indicate
   the following association: Nurses and physicians seem to be able to
   reduce CaPts' unmet information needs by establishing a relationship
   with the patient, which is trusting, caring and empathic.}},

Title = {{Empathy in senior year and first year medical students: a
   cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: The importance of fostering the development of empathy in
   undergraduate students is continuously emphasized in international
   recommendations for medical education. Paradoxically, some studies in
   the North American context using self-reported measures have found that
   empathy declines during undergraduate medical training. Empathy is also
   known to be gender dependent- (highest for female medical students) and
   related to specialty preference - (higher in patient-oriented than
   technology-oriented specialties). This factor has not been studied in
   Portuguese medical schools.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of undergraduate medical
   students on self-rated measures of empathy collected at entrance and at
   the conclusion of the medical degree, and on the association of empathy
   measures with gender and specialty preferences in one medical school in
   Portugal. Empathy was assessed using the Portuguese adaptation of the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-students version (JSPE-spv) among
   three cohorts of undergraduate medical students in the first (N = 356)
   and last (N = 120) year. The construct validity of JSPE-spv was
   cross-validated with Principal Component Analysis and Confirmatory
   Factor Analysis. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach' Alpha. Global
   JSPE-spv score differences were examined by year of medical school,
   gender and specialty preferences (people-oriented vs technology-oriented
   specialties).
   Results: The empathy scores of students in the final year were higher as
   compared to first year students (F (1,387) = 19.33, p < .001, boxed
   times(2)(p) = 0.48; pi = 0.99). Female students had higher empathy
   scores than male students (F (1,387) = 8.82, p < .01, boxed times(2)(p)
   = 0.23; pi = 0.84). Significant differences in empathy were not found
   between the students who prefer people-oriented specialties compared to
   those who favor the technology-oriented specialties (F (1,387) = 2.44, p
   = .12, boxed times(2)(p) = 0.06; pi = 0.06).
   Conclusions: This cross-sectional study in one medical school in
   Portugal showed that the empathy measures of senior year students were
   higher than the scores of freshmen. A longitudinal cohort study is
   needed to test variations in students' empathy measures throughout
   medical school.}},

Title = {{The Patient Enablement Instrument-French version in a family practice
   setting: a reliability study}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient enablement can be defined as the extent to which a
   patient is capable of understanding and coping with his or her health
   issues. This concept is linked to a number of health outcomes such as
   self-management of chronic diseases and quality of life. The Patient
   Enablement Instrument (PEI) was designed to measure this concept after a
   medical consultation. The instrument, in its original form and its
   translations into several languages, has proven to be reliable and
   valid. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the
   French version of the PEI (PEI-Fv) in a family practice setting.
   Methods: One hundred and ten participants were recruited in a family
   medicine clinic in the Saguenay region of Quebec (Canada). The PEI-Fv
   was completed twice, immediately after consultation with a physician
   (T1) and 2 weeks after the consultation (T2). The internal consistency
   of the tool was assessed with Cronbach's alpha and test-retest
   reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient.
   Results: The mean score for the PEI-Fv was 5.06 +/- 3.97 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 4.30-5.81) at T1 and 4.63 +/- 3.90 (95\% CI:
   3.82-5.44) at T2. Cronbach's a was high at T1 (alpha(1) = 0.93; 95\% CI:
   0.91-0.95) and T2 (alpha(2) = 0.93; 95\% CI: 0.91-0.95). The intraclass
   correlation coefficient was 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.48-0.74), indicating a
   moderate test-retest reliability.
   Conclusions: The internal consistency of the PEI-Fv is excellent.
   Test-retest reliability was moderate to good. Test-retest reliability
   should be examined in further studies at a less than 2-week interval to
   reduce maturation bias. This instrument can be used to measure
   enablement after consultation in a French-speaking family practice
   setting.}},

Title = {{A Pilot Study of Motivational Interviewing Training in a Virtual World}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based,
   patient-centered counseling strategy proven to support patients seeking
   health behavior change. Yet the time and travel commitment for MI
   training is often a barrier to the adoption of MI by health care
   professionals. Virtual worlds such as Second Life (SL) are rapidly
   becoming part of the educational technology landscape and offer not only
   the potential to improve access to MI training but also to deepen the MI
   training experience through the use of immersive online environments.
   Despite SL's potential for medical education applications, little work
   is published studying its use for this purpose and still less is known
   of educational outcomes for physician training in MI using a
   virtual-world platform.
   Objective: Our aims were to (1) explore the feasibility, acceptability,
   and effectiveness of a virtual-world platform for delivering MI training
   designed for physicians and (2) pilot test instructional designs using
   SL for MI training.
   Methods: We designed and pilot tested an MI training program in the SL
   virtual world. We trained and enrolled 13 primary care physicians in a
   two-session, interactive program in SL on the use of MI for counseling
   patients about colorectal cancer screening. We measured self-reported
   changes in confidence and clinical practice patterns for counseling on
   colorectal cancer screening, and acceptability of the virtual-world
   learning environment and the MI instructional design. Effectiveness of
   the MI training was assessed by coding and scoring tape-recorded
   interviews with a blinded mock patient conducted pre- and post-training.
   Results: A total of 13 physicians completed the training. Acceptability
   ratings for the MI training ranged from 4.1 to 4.7 on a 5-point scale.
   The SL learning environment was also highly rated, with 77\% (n = 10) of
   the doctors reporting SL to be an effective educational medium.
   Learners' confidence and clinical practice patterns for colorectal
   cancer screening improved after training. Pre- to post-training mean
   confidence scores for the ability to elicit and address barriers to
   colorectal cancer screening (4.5 to 6.2, P = .004) and knowledge of
   decision-making psychology (4.5 to 5.7, P = .02) and behavior change
   psychology (4.9 to 6.2, P = .02) increased significantly. Global MI
   skills scores increased significantly and component scores for the MI
   skills also increased, with statistically significant improvements in 4
   of the 5 component skills: empathy (3.12 to 3.85, P = .001), autonomy
   (3.07 to 3.85, P < .001), collaboration (2.88 to 3.46, P = .02), and
   evocative response (2.80 to 3.61, P = .008).
   Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that virtual worlds
   offer the potential for a new medical education pedagogy that will
   enhance learning outcomes for patient-centered communication skills
   training.}},

Title = {{Examining nurse empathy for infant procedural pain: Testing a new video
   measure}},
Journal = {{PAIN RESEARCH \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Research reporting effective pain care strategies exists,
   yet it is not translated to care. Little is known about how repeated
   pain exposure has affected nurses' ability to be empathetic and use
   their knowledge to provide evidence-based care. Concerns have been
   raised regarding the validity of self-report empathy instruments;
   therefore, a novel video program was developed for testing. It was
   hypothesized that those who viewed infants in painful and nonpainful
   states would have a measureable empathy (pain rating) response
   correlating to the level of pain expressed by the infants.
   OBJECTIVE: To validate the newly developed Empathy for Infant Pain video
   program (EIPvp) by determining whether nurse and non-nurse control
   groups' pain scores of 24 video clips showing infants undergoing real
   medical procedures were equal.
   DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional video judgement study.
   METHODS: Fifty female participants (25 nurses and 25 allied health
   controls) were asked to score the infant procedural pain level displayed
   in the EIPvp using a visual analogue scale and a composite score of
   known infant pain cues. Participants also scored their own sensitivity
   to painful events.
   RESULTS: Participants rated the videos contained in the EIPvp similarly
   in three categories (no, low or high pain); however, there were
   consistent differences between groups within the categories. Nurses
   scored facial cues for all categories higher than the control group.
   Nurses scored their own pain in hypothetical situations and that of the
   infants consistently higher than the control group.
   CONCLUSION: The EIPvp yielded predictable responses from both the nurse
   and non-nurse control groups when scoring the pain expressed in the
   video clips. Nurses' detection of pain more often than controls may have
   been an indication that they have greater knowledge of pain cues, or
   their empathy levels may have been different as a result of their
   exposure to, or their perceived relationship with, patients. The EIPvp
   was validated and has promising potential for training and research
   purposes.}},

   second- and third-year residents at the University of New Mexico School
   of Medicine regarding their views of the relationship of personal life
   experience with illness to compassion and empathy for patients. Results:
   Residents believe that experience with personal health issues enhances
   physician compassion for patients. Residents who report more personal
   health concerns, such as physical or mental health problems and family
   health problems, endorse the connection between direct experience with
   illness and empathy. Conclusion: Health care trainees' own illness
   experiences may increase compassionate patient care practices and foster
   empathy. (Psychosomatics 2011; 52:367-374)}},

Abstract = {{University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS) students attending a
   seminar on the history and ethics of anatomical dissection were
   fascinated by a report on the dissection room experience in Thailand
   that relates the body donor's status as a teacher. The students felt
   that they had naturally adopted the ``body as teacher{''} approach in
   their dissection course, rather than the ``body as first patient{''}
   approach that is encouraged by faculty. It was decided to explore the
   question whether other medical students shared these perceptions. A
   questionnaire was sent out to all UMMS students who had finished the
   anatomical dissection course. One hundred twenty-eight responses from a
   population of 500 students were received. Results indicate that students
   believe the ``body as teacher{''} approach is more effective in
   engendering respect and empathy towards the body and towards future
   patients, and in facilitating students' emotional development. Students
   also reported wanting a more personal relationship with their donors.
   Eighty four percent of students preferred the ``body as teacher{''}
   approach to the currently taught ``body as first patient{''} approach.
   The results support the hypothesis that students' desired closer
   personal relationship with donors might be better facilitated by the
   ``body as teacher{''} approach, and that this closer relationship
   engenders empathy and respect towards the donor and future patients. A
   new model for anatomy programs could introduce the donor first as a
   teacher and later transition into viewing the donor as a patient. Anat

Title = {{Iranian staff nurses' attitudes toward nursing students}},
Journal = {{NURSE EDUCATION TODAY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{477-481}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Clinical education is an indispensible part of the nursing
   education. Clinical nurses play an important role in this teaching
   learning process. The quality and quantity of student-nurse interactions
   in the clinical area can either facilitate or hamper students' learning.
   The rationale of this research was to probe into staff nurses' attitudes
   toward nursing students within the context of clinical education in
   Iran. The nursing literature seems wanting in issues related to staff
   nurses' attitudes toward nursing students. Thus, we draw on Peplau's
   interpersonal relations in nursing to address staff-student
   relationship. That is, the nursing student was taken as the client.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was selected for this
   study. The entire staff nurses of Medical and Surgical units (n = 82)
   employed at Dr Fatemi and Imam Khomeini hospitals of Ardabil medical
   sciences university were selected. Stagg's questionnaire and a
   demographic tool were used to gather data. Attitudes were measured using
   a five-point Likert scale. Attitudes of staff nurses were inspected
   using cross tabulations and frequencies.
   Findings: The results demonstrated that attitude scores toward nursing
   students were low and moderate. Some nurses (45.71\%) believed that
   working with students is pleasant and most (98.57\%) have thought that
   staff should have a good relationship with nursing students.
   Furthermore, staff nurses pointed out that the there is a need to
   overhaul the educational system of nursing students (94.3\%), that
   nursing students do not acquire the sufficient clinical skill (67.14\%),
   and that the students are not prepared enough for the clinical task
   (51.43\%).
   Conclusion: According to the results of the staffs' feelings on the
   relationship between nurse and student, it seems that nurses should
   cultivate an atmosphere which ends to empathy, assurance and sincerity
   of nursing students. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Studies have found a high prevalence of psychological distress among
   medical students both in the United States and abroad. Distress among
   medical students has serious professional ramifications, including
   damaging effects on empathy, ethical conduct, and professionalism, as
   well as personal consequences such as substance abuse, broken
   relationships, and suicidal ideation. Given the effect of physician
   distress on quality of care, self-care (including personal appraisal of
   wellbeing, wellness promotion, and recognition of when help is needed)
   should be recognized as a core competency for physicians. In this issue
   of Academic Medicine, investigators at the Northwestern University
   Feinberg School of Medicine explore the benefits of teaching students to
   employ a cognitive behavioral approach to improving self-care. Beyond
   its demonstrated short-term efficacy, the approach they propose also has
   potential to help students develop the skills necessary to assess and
   promote resilience throughout their careers. Medical schools'
   responsibility to promote student wellness, however, goes beyond
   teaching students self-care skills and includes establishing an
   appropriate organizational culture and learning environment to promote
   student health. Achieving competency in self-care is a shared
   responsibility of the individual physician/resident/medical student and
   the organizational environment in which he or she functions.}},

Title = {{The Association Between Intolerance of Ambiguity and Decline in Medical
   Students' Attitudes Toward the Underserved}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Little published research details the risk factors for the decline in
   students' attitudes toward underserved populations during medical
   school. The authors assessed the association between this attitude
   change and intolerance of ambiguity (the tendency to perceive novel or
   complex situations as sources of threat), since treating underserved
   populations often involves a high level of complexity.
   Method
   The University of New Mexico School of Medicine administered a survey
   assessing attitudes toward underserved populations at matriculation and
   at graduation to seven consecutive medical school classes (matriculation
   years 1999 to 2005). The university also administered a survey measuring
   tolerance of ambiguity at matriculation. Five hundred twenty-nine
   students were eligible to complete both surveys between 1999 and 2009.
   Results
   Three hundred thirteen (59\%) students completed the attitude survey at
   matriculation and graduation. Attitude scores for a majority of students
   (69\%) decreased from matriculation to graduation. Changes in scores
   ranged from +25 to -35; the average change was -4.5. Linear regression
   analysis showed that those who were tolerant of ambiguity (top 20\% of
   tolerance of ambiguity scores) were significantly less likely to have
   declines in attitudes toward the underserved; the coefficient was 3.69
   (P=.003). Other factors independently associated with maintaining high
   attitude scores were being female and starting medical school at age 24
   or younger.
   Conclusions
   Attention to, and practice with, ambiguous situations may help moderate
   decreases in attitudes toward underserved populations. Medical education
   should address the fact that physicians face much ambiguity and should
   offer students tools to help them respond to ambiguous clinical
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To determine whether the Medical Student Well-Being Index (MSWBI) can
   serve as a brief assessment tool to identify medical students in severe
   psychological distress.
   Method
   The authors used data from 2,248 medical students at seven U.S. medical
   schools who responded to a 2007 survey to explore the accuracy of the
   MSWBI in identifying medical students with three outcomes: low mental
   quality of life (QOL; defined by having a Medical Outcomes Study
   Short-Form Health Survey mental component summary score >= 1/2 standard
   deviation below that of the age-and gender-matched population norm),
   suicidal ideation, or serious thoughts of dropping out. The authors
   confirmed their analyses using data from a separate sample of 2,682
   students evaluated in 2009.
   Results
   Students with low mental QOL, suicidal ideation, or serious thoughts of
   dropping out were more likely to endorse each individual MSWBI item and
   a greater number of total items than were students without such distress
   (all P < .001). The likelihood ratio for low mental QOL among students
   with MSWBI scores <4 was 0.47 as compared with 4.79 for those with
   scores >= 4. At an MSWBI threshold score of >= 4, the MSWBI's
   sensitivity and specificity for identifying students with low mental QOL
   or recent suicidal ideation/serious thoughts of dropping out were both
   >= 90\%. On multivariable logistic regression, all MSWBI items were
   independently associated with at least one outcome.
   Conclusions
   The MSWBI is a useful brief screening tool to help identify students
   with severe distress.}},

Abstract = {{While empathy is commonly accepted as a mutually beneficial aspect of
   the health provider--patient relationship, evidence exists that many
   health profession students are unable to demonstrate this important
   skill. This study, the initial phase of a 2-year longitudinal series,
   examined measurement properties of the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy (JSPE) adapted for administration to health profession students
   (JSE-HPS version), and investigated group differences of empathy scores
   in the baccalaureate nursing (BSN) program within the College of Health
   Professions at a public university in the southeastern part of the USA.
   The 20-item survey and a demographic questionnaire were completed by 265
   BSN students. Correlational analyses, t-test, and analysis of variance
   were used to examine internal relationships and group differences.
   Results showed the median item-total score correlation was statistically
   significant (0.42). The internal consistency of the scale (Cronbach''s
   coefficient alpha alpha) was 0.78, falling within the generally agreed
   standard. Test-retest reliability coefficients were acceptable at 0.58
   (within 3 months interval) and 0.69 (within 6 months interval) between
   testing. Women scored higher than men and older students outscored
   younger classmates. No significant relationship was found between
   empathy scores and ethnicity, previous non-nursing degree, or importance
   of religion to the participant. These findings support measurement
   properties of the JSE-HPS version, and can bolster the confidence of
   researchers in using the Scale for measuring empathy in diverse health
   profession students, as one component of program evaluation as well as
   evaluating interprofessional learning activities among diverse
   healthcare professional students and interprofessional collaboration.</.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT Early clinical experience is thought to contribute to the
   professional development of medical students, but little is known about
   the kind of learning processes that actually take place. Learning in
   practice is highly informal and may be difficult to direct by predefined
   learning outcomes. Learning in medical practice includes a socialisation
   process in which some learning outcomes may be valued, but others
   neglected or discouraged.
   OBJECTIVES This study describes students' learning goals (prior to a
   Year 1 nursing attachment) and learning outcomes (after the attachment)
   in relation to institutional educational goals, and evaluates
   associations between learning outcomes, student characteristics and
   place of attachment.
   METHODS A questionnaire containing open-ended questions about learning
   goals and learning outcomes was administered to all Year 1 medical
   students (n = 347) before and directly after a 4-week nursing attachment
   in either a hospital or a nursing home. Two confirmatory focus group
   interviews were conducted and data were analysed using qualitative and
   quantitative content analyses.
   RESULTS Students' learning goals corresponded with educational goals
   with a main emphasis on communication and empathy. Other learning goals
   included gaining insight into the organisation of health care and
   learning to deal with emotions. Self-reported learning outcomes were the
   same, but students additionally mentioned reflection on professional
   behaviour and their own future development. Women and younger students
   mentioned communication and empathy more often than men and older
   students. Individual learning goals, with the exception of communicating
   and empathising with patients, did not predict learning outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS Students' learning goals closely match educational goals,
   which are adequately met in early nursing attachments in both hospitals
   and nursing homes. Learning to deal with emotions was under-represented
   as a learning goal and learning outcome, which may indicate that
   emotional aspects of medical students' professional development are
   neglected in the first year of medical education.}},

Abstract = {{The field of placebo research has made considerable progress in the last
   years and it has become a major focus of interest. We know now that the
   placebo effect is a real neurobiological phenomenon and that the brain's
   `inner pharmacy' is a critical determinant for the occurrence of
   psychobiological and behavioural changes relevant to healing processes
   and well-being. However, harnessing the advantages of placebo effects in
   healthcare is still a challenge. The first part of the theme issue
   summarizes and discusses the various kinds of placebo mechanisms across
   medical fields, thereby not only focusing on two main explanatory
   models-expectation and conditioning theory-but also taking into account
   empathy and social learning, emotion and motivation, spirituality and
   the healing ritual. The second part of the issue focuses on questions
   related to transferring knowledge from placebo research into clinical
   practice and discusses implications for the design and interpretation of
   clinical trials, for the therapeutic settings in daily patient care, and
   for future translational placebo research.}},

   technolgies for diagnosis, treatment and data processing. Paradoxically,
   however, this progress, which should have favored the doctor-patient
   relationship, has often resulted in a poorer bedside manner (listening,
   dialogue, physical examination, etc.). Many foctors are responsible for
   this situation. The French National Academy of Medicine emphasizes that
   today as in the past, humanism is an essential aspect of medicine and
   that clinical practice is complementary to and inseparable from the
   technolgies it uses.}},

Abstract = {{Voice and person form a unity and consequently, psychological factors
   always play a role in the treatment of voice disorders, especially in
   the area of the arts. This fact has to be taken into account in
   musician's medicine and it leads to integrating psychosomatic principles
   within the medical consultation, such as sufficient time, open
   structured communication, as well as empathy in the doctor-patient
   relationship. Furthermore, another important aspect of the treatment of
   singers is the understanding, based on musical expertise, towards the
   emotional requirements of the profession. If there is a distinct
   psychological component in the voice disorder it has to be included as a
   cofactor in the diagnostics. In such a case, the decision of the
   otorhinolaryngologist should be to include the treatment of the
   psychological factors within the voice therapy or to initiate parallel
   treatment in close cooperation with a specialist in psychosomatic
   medicine or a clinical psychologist specialized in musician's medicine.
   For singers, performance anxiety represents the additional frequent
   diagnosis and it should also be treated in this cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, U.S. dental schools report pass/fail grades and do not

   Examinations will report National Board Dental Examination (NBDE) scores
   as pass/fail after January 1, 2012. This article discusses how these
   changes will force postdoctoral dental program directors to modify how
   they assess candidates and how noncognitive evaluations might enhance
   those assessments. The authors propose developing a national qualifying
   examination for postdoctoral dental programs that will measure
   knowledge, decision making, and noncognitive traits including empathy,
   self-confidence, integrity, and emotional intelligence. Without NBDE
   scores, class rank, and GPA as a basis for decision making, a single
   national qualifying examination would assist postdoctoral programs in
   selecting high-quality candidates based on knowledge, critical thinking
   skills, and noncognitive traits.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{747-751}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To test the hypotheses that peer nomination is associated with measures
   of (1) academic performance, (2) empathy, (3) personality, and (4)
   specialty interest.
   Method
   In 2007-2008, 255 third-year medical students at Jefferson Medical
   College were asked to nominate classmates they considered the best in
   six areas of clinical and humanistic excellence. The authors compared
   students who received nominations with those who did not, analyzing
   differences in academic performance, personality factors (empathy as
   measured by the Jefferson Scale of Empathy and personality qualities as
   measured by the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire), and
   specialty interests.
   Results
   A comparison of the 155 students who received at least one peer
   nomination with the 100 students who received none found no significant
   difference in scores on objective examinations; nominated students,
   however, were rated significantly higher in clinical competence by
   faculty in six core third-year clerkships. Nominated students were also
   significantly more empathic and ``active.{''} In addition, a larger
   proportion of nominated students choose ``people-oriented{''} (rather
   than ``technology- or procedure-oriented{''}) specialties.
   Conclusions
   These results confirmed the hypotheses that peer nomination can predict
   clinical competence, empathy and other positive personal qualities, and
   interest in people-oriented specialties. Thus, in the assessment of
   medical students, peer nomination holds promise as a valid indicator of
   positive dimensions of professionalism.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is commonly regarded as an essential attribute for doctors and
   there is a conviction that empathy must be taught to medical students.
   Yet it is not clear exactly what empathy is, from a philosophical or
   sociological point of view, or whether it can be taught. The meaning,
   role and relevance of empathy in medical education have tended to be
   unquestioningly assumed; there is a need to examine and contextualise
   these assumptions. This paper opens up that debate, arguing that
   `empathy', as it is commonly understood, is neither necessary nor
   sufficient to guarantee good medical or ethical practice.}},

   coalition, represents 22 national, autonomous patient support groups.
   Its aim includes increasing the awareness of prostate diseases, support
   individualized treatment as a balance between optimal medical treatment
   and personalized care delivered by a multiprofessional team. We expect
   our information/education from dedicated professional societies while in
   return we share care for properly informed members as well as a fast,
   unbiased and cheap distribution of information/innovation across the
   European continent. The role of a patient group. Our advocacy role is
   focused on quality of life, tailored treatment, knowledge of risk
   factors, support for research and last but not least active
   partnerships. We believe that we can play a modest but basic role in
   common actions to overcome inequalities in treatment and care in Europe.
   Our responsibilities range from defining patient obligations to
   facilitating translational research and saving scarce health resources.
   The horizon of the patient. Our hope is to plead for a treatment policy
   on the man first and then on his cancer and to improve treatment
   outcomes by multiprofessional collaboration and the development of
   expert Prostate Units. Future expectations. A transparent, open
   communication line between the multiprofessional team and the patient is
   mandatory. The existing uncertainties should be discussed with common
   sense but always leave a factor of hope in survival or quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   This study investigated the relationship between empathy and grades,
   marital status and personality in psychiatric residents.
   Methods
   We sent a questionnaire package to 592 psychiatric residents in 82
   psychiatric residency training hospitals. The questionnaire package
   collected socio-demographic data, and included the Jefferson Scale of
   Empathy, HP-version, Korean edition (JSE-HP-K), and Temperament and
   Character Inventory (TCI).
   Results
   Fourth-year residents had significantly higher scores on the JSE-HP-K
   than 1st-year residents. Marital status and empathy had significant
   correlation. Married residents showed significantly higher scores on the
   JSE-HP-K. There were no significant differences in empathy with regard
   to age, sex, motivation towards medical science (entering medical school
   and psychiatry) and club activity. There was no significant correlation
   between subscales of the TCI and JSE-HP-K score.
   Discussion
   These results suggest that empathy is associated with marital status and
   that psychiatry residency program contributes incrementally to empathy
   for residents.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop and evaluate an intervention for final year
   medical students to reduce stigma against people with schizophrenia.
   Method: A total of 87 students participated in a 3-h workshop that
   included both a contact component (a DVD of a young man with
   schizophrenia) and an experience of simulated auditory hallucinations.
   Attitudes to schizophrenia were evaluated using the Attitudes to Mental
   Illness Questionnaire (AMIQ), completed at the beginning and end of the
   workshop.
   Results: There was a significant improvement in mean AMIQ scores after
   participating in the workshop. Students with more negative attitudes
   before the workshop showed the most significant improvement, whilst
   there was little change for students who held more positive attitudes.
   Conclusion: A workshop combining a DVD narrative by a young person with
   schizophrenia and simulated auditory hallucinations is an effective
   teaching tool to improve medical students' attitudes to people with
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A brief and psychometrically sound scale to
   measure patients' overall satisfaction with their primary care
   physicians would be useful in studies where a longer instrument is
   impractical. The purpose of this study was to develop and examine the
   psychometrics of a brief instrument to measure patients' overall
   satisfaction with their primary care physicians.
   METHODS: Research participants included 535 outpatients (between 18-75
   years old, 66\% female) who completed a mailed survey that included 10
   items for measuring overall satisfaction with their primary care
   physician who was named on the survey. Patients were also asked about
   their perceptions of physician empathy, preventive tests recommended by
   the physician (colonoscopy, mammogram, and prostate-specific antigen
   (PSA) for age and gender appropriate patients) and demographic
   information.
   RESULTS: Factor analysis of the patient satisfaction items resulted in
   one prominent component. Corrected item-total score correlations of the
   patient satisfaction scale ranged from 0.85 to 0.96; correlation between
   patient satisfaction scores and patient perception of physician empathy
   was 0.93, and correlation with recommending the physician to family and
   friends was 0.92. Criterion-related validity coefficients were mostly in
   the 0.80s and 0.90s. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly
   higher for those whose physicians recommended preventive tests
   (colonoscopy, mammogram, and PSA-compliance rates >.80). Cronbach's
   coefficient alpha for patient satisfaction scale was 0.98.
   CONCLUSIONS: Empirical evidence supported the validity and reliability
   of a brief patient satisfaction scale that has utility in the
   assessments of educational programs aimed at improving patient
   satisfaction, medical services, and patient outcomes in primary care
   settings.}},

Title = {{Levels of empathy in undergraduate midwifery students: An Australian

Abstract = {{Objective: This exploratory study investigated empathy and attitudes
   towards specific medical conditions, two important aspects of the
   midwife-woman relationship, amongst undergraduate midwifery students at
   one university.
   Method: Fifty-two Bachelor of Midwifery students across three years of
   the course completed questionnaires, the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy-Health Professional (JSPE-HP) version and the Medical Condition
   Regard Scale (MCRS). Both the JSPE-HP and the MCRS are standardised,
   self-report questionnaires with established reliability and validity.
   Findings: An overall respectable level of empathy was measured, which
   was shown to increase consistently and substantially with each year
   level of the student undergraduate program. Attitudes to selected
   diagnoses were very good with the exception being substance abuse, which
   received a significantly lower mean.
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the Bachelor of
   Midwifery course, or studying midwifery, has a positive effect on
   students' empathy. Low results in participants' attitudes towards
   patients presenting with substance abuse raises concern that students
   may harbour prejudice that could impinge upon their professional
   practice and the way in which they care for these mothers. Hence, this
   aspect in particular may need further development within midwifery
   curriculum development. Further research around other conditions may
   extend on our understandings of empathy and attitudes in midwifery
   students and practitioners. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe how psychology and
   medical students assess their own competency and skills before and after
   training, in which role-play was used to teach interpersonal and
   communication skills.
   Method: Interpersonal and communication skills were assessed with a
   semi-structured questionnaire before and after the training.
   Results: The students of both medicine and psychology estimated their
   skill levels to be higher after the course. The psychology students
   estimated their skills for communication, motivating interviewing,
   empathy and reflection, and change orientation to be better at the end
   of the course. Medical students estimated their communication skills,
   motivating interviewing skills, and change orientation skills to be
   better at the end of the course.
   Conclusion: Even a short period of training in interpersonal and
   communication skills can positively affect the self-assessed skills of
   the medical students.
   Practice implications: In the future, it would be worthwhile to pay
   attention to reflective teaching practices in the training of both
   medical and psychology students. The cognitive and emotional components
   of these practices help students to develop their own communication
   skills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pediatric oncology is a medical specialty, which implies strong
   emotions. Because of the huge clinical variety of diseases, the
   multi-disciplinary aspects of this specialty and the innovative
   therapies used, paediatric oncology is definitely an attractive
   specialty. Care and empathy that follows creates a special relationship
   between them and the child with his family. These emotions might be
   pleasant or unpleasant but are always at the centre of the resident's
   day to day life. The resident's route is sometimes difficult since it
   includes not only diagnostic announcement and various therapeutic
   strategies, but also relapses, palliative care and child's death, which
   is sometimes unavoidable. This article sheds light on the personal
   experience throughout various departments of pediatric oncology and

   impact on patients' perceived empathy}},

Abstract = {{Objective Many healthcare organizations (HCOs) including Kaiser
   Permanente, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Medical Center, and MD Anderson
   Cancer Center, provide access to online health communities as part of
   their overall patient support services. The key objective in
   establishing and running these online health communities is to offer
   empathic support to patients. Patients' perceived empathy is considered
   to be critical in patient recovery, specifically, by enhancing patient's
   compliance with treatment protocols and the pace of healing. Most online
   health communities are characterized by two main functions:
   informational support and social support. This study examines the
   relative impact of these two distinct functions that is, as an
   information seeking forum and as a social support forum on patients'
   perceived empathy in online health communities.
   Design This study tests the impact of two variables that reflect the
   above functions of online health communities information seeking
   effectiveness and perceived social support on perceived empathy. The
   model also incorporates the potential moderating effect of homophily on
   these relationships.
   Measurements A web-based survey was used to collect data from members of
   the online health communities provided by three major healthcare
   centers. A regression technique was used to analyze the data to test the
   hypotheses.
   Results The study finds that it is the information seeking effectiveness
   rather than the social support which affects patient's perceived empathy
   in online health communities run by HCOs. The results indicate that HCOs
   that provide online health communities for their patients need to focus
   more on developing tools that will make information seeking more
   effective and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Contemporary educational approaches to professionalism do
   not take into account the dominant influence that the culture of
   academic medicine has on the nascent professional attitudes, beliefs,
   and behaviors of medical learners. This article examines formation as an
   organizing principle for professionalism in medical education. Virtue,
   the foundation to understanding professionalism, is the habits and
   dispositions that are fostered in individuals but that are embedded in
   learning environments. Formation, the ongoing integration of an
   individual, growing in self-awareness and in recognition of a life of
   service, with others who share in the common mission of a larger group,
   depicts this process. One model of formation considers a continuum from
   novice to more advance stages that is predicated on rules that must be
   applied in greater contextually shaped situations. Within medical
   education, formation is the process by which lives of service are
   created and sustained by learning communities that promote human
   capacities for intuition, empathy, and compassion. An imagined
   curriculum in formation would link the lived experiences of mentors and
   learners with an interdisciplinary set of didactic materials in an
   intentionally progressive fashion.}},

Journal = {{FAMILY MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Most studies showed that patients would first go to their
   primary care physicians (PCPs) when depressed. This choice is probably
   due to PCP being the entry point into the health care system. We studied
   the general population's initial choice of mental care in Hong Kong,
   where patients were unclear about family medicine and free to choose
   doctors of any specialty.
   METHODS: A combined qualitative and quantitative approach was adopted.
   We held focus groups with participants recruited from community centers
   and a telephone survey with adults ages 18 or above randomly selected
   from the domestic telephone directory.
   RESULTS: Of 1,647 adults successfully interviewed, 49.0\% would seek
   help from their regular PCP, 19.3\% from psychiatrists, 4.8\% from any
   doctors, 16.5\% from non-medical resources; 6.9\% would not seek any
   help, and 3.5\% were uncertain of what to do. Those who did not seek any
   help were more likely to be male or without regular doctors. The focus
   group participants highlighted the stigmatizing effect of consulting
   psychiatrists and expressed strong expectation of empathic relationship,
   time, and communication skills from their care providers. Some
   participants were not aware that PCP could manage mental illness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given free choice of health care service, most people would
   first consult their regular doctors for treatment of depression
   specifically because of better relationship and no stigmatization. To
   draw depressed patients to seek help, especially from primary care,
   public education of the PCPs role in mental health should be promoted,
   and the PCPs could demonstrate their empathy and listening skills to
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological evidence indicates that African Americans receive lower
   quality pain treatment than European Americans. However, the factors
   causing these disparities remain unidentified, and solutions to this
   problem remain elusive. Across three laboratory experiments, we examined
   the hypotheses that empathy is not only causing pain treatment
   disparities but that empathy-inducing interventions can reduce these
   disparities. Undergraduates (Experiments 1 and 2) and nursing
   professionals (Experiment 3) watched videos of real Black and White
   patients' genuine facial expressions of pain, provided pain treatment
   decisions, and reported their feelings of empathy for each patient. The
   efficacy of an empathy-inducing, perspective-taking intervention at
   reducing pain treatment disparities was also examined (Experiments 2 and
   3). When instructed to attempt to provide patients with the best care,
   participants exhibited significant pro-White pain treatment biases.
   However, participants engaged in an empathy-inducing, perspective-taking
   intervention that instructed them to imagine how patients' pain affected
   patients' lives exhibited upwards of a 55\% reduction in pain treatment
   bias in comparison to controls. Furthermore, Pro-White empathy biases
   were highly predictive of pro-White pain treatment biases. The magnitude
   of the empathy bias experienced predicted the magnitude of the treatment
   bias exhibited. These findings suggest that empathy plays a crucial role
   in racial pain treatment disparities in that it appears not only to be
   one likely cause of pain treatment disparities but also is an important
   means for reducing racial disparities in pain treatment. (C) 2010

Title = {{Physicians' messages in problematic sickness certification: a narrative
   analysis of case reports}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many physicians find sickness certification tasks
   problematic. There is some knowledge about situations that are
   experienced as problematic, whereas less is understood about how
   physicians respond to the problems they face. One way to acquire such
   knowledge is to consider ``reflection-in-action{''}, aspects of which
   are expressed in the physician's interpretation of the patient's story.
   The aim of this study was to gain knowledge about the meaning content of
   case reports about problematic sickness certification. Specifically, we
   looked for possible messages to the colleagues intended to read the
   reports.
   Methods: A narrative approach was used to analyse reports about
   problematic sickness certification cases that had been written by GPs
   and occupational health service physicians as part of a sickness
   insurance course. The analysis included elements from both thematic and
   structural analysis. Nineteen case reports were used in the actual
   analysis and 25 in the validation of the results. Main narrative
   qualities and structural features of the written case reports were
   explored.
   Results: Five types of messages were identified in the case reports,
   here classified as ``a call for help{''}, ``a call for
   understanding{''}, ``hidden worries{''}, ``in my opinion{''}, and
   ``appearing neutral{''}. In the reports, the physicians tried to achieve
   neutrality in their writing, and the patients' stories tended to be
   interpreted within a traditional biomedical framework. In some cases
   there was an open request for help, in others it was not obvious that
   the physician had any problems. Overall, the messages were about having
   problems as such, rather than the specific features of the problems.
   Conclusions: The case reports clearly demonstrated different ways of
   writing about problems that arise during sickness certification, from
   being neutral and not mentioning the problems to being emotionally
   involved and asking for help. The general character of the messages
   suggests that they are also relevant for case reports in problematic
   areas other than sickness certification. If pertinent relationships can
   be found between reflection-in-practice and the narrative writing about
   practice, they will provide an approach to further research concerning
   consultations perceived as problematic and also to medical education.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   The disclosure of harmful errors to patients is recommended, but appears
   to be uncommon. Understanding how trainees disclose errors and how their
   practices evolve during training could help educators design programmes
   to address this gap. This study was conducted to determine how trainees
   would disclose medical errors.
   Methods
   We surveyed 758 trainees (488 students and 270 residents) in internal
   medicine at two academic medical centres. Surveys depicted one of two
   harmful error scenarios that varied by how apparent the error would be
   to the patient. We measured attitudes and disclosure content using
   scripted responses.
   Results
   Trainees reported their intent to disclose the error as `definitely'
   (43\%), `probably' (47\%), `only if asked by patient' (9\%), and
   `definitely not' (1\%). Trainees were more likely to disclose obvious
   errors than errors that patients were unlikely to recognise (55\% versus
   30\%; p < 0.01). Respondents varied widely in the type of information
   they would disclose. Overall, 50\% of trainees chose to use statements
   that explicitly stated that an error rather than only an adverse event
   had occurred. Regarding apologies, trainees were split between conveying
   a general expression of regret (52\%) and making an explicit apology
   (46\%). Respondents at higher levels of training were less likely to use
   explicit apologies (trend p < 0.01). Prior disclosure training was
   associated with increased willingness to disclose errors (odds ratio
   1.40, p = 0.03).
   Conclusions
   Trainees may not be prepared to disclose medical errors to patients and
   worrisome trends in trainee apology practices were observed across
   levels of training. Medical educators should intensify efforts to
   enhance trainees' skills in meeting patients' expectations for the open
   disclosure of harmful medical errors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To categorize physician communication demonstrating
   understanding of what patients want to know and skill in conveying that
   information. Physicians underestimate how much information patients want
   and patients rarely seek information during clinic visits. Transparent
   communication is advocated to facilitate patient understanding and
   support autonomy, informed decision-making and relationship development.
   Methods: Analysis and coding of 263 audiotaped interactions between 33
   primary care physicians and their patients in eight community-based,
   primary care clinics in Washington State, USA.
   Results: Physicians proactively used five types of process transparency
   to preview speech and actions. Four types of content transparency were
   used to explicate diagnosis and treatment, demystify medical language
   and concepts, and interpret biomedical information. Physicians spent the
   greatest proportion of clinic time explicating medical content.
   Conclusion: The primacy of information exchange over process-oriented,
   relational communication was demonstrated. Proactive transparency
   appears promising to increase understanding and collaboration.
   Practice implications: In patient-centered care where collaboration is
   the ideal, transparency in its various forms is a critical ingredient.
   Without much communicative effort, physicians who proactively
   communicated that an examination was over, that they were leaving the
   exam room briefly so patients could dress provided information that
   appeared to address patient uncertainty and demonstrated empathy and
   respect. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{On November 2, 2010, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of
   Schwarzenegger v Entertainment Merchants Association, with a ruling
   expected in 2011. This case addressed whether states have the right to
   restrict freedom of speech by limiting the sale of violent video games
   to minors. To date, 8 states have tried to pass legislation to this
   effect, with all attempts being found unconstitutional by lower courts.
   In large part, the Supreme Court's decision will be determined by its
   review and interpretation of the medical and social science literature
   addressing the effects of violent video games on children. Those on both
   sides of the violent video game debate claim that the scientific
   literature supports their opinions. Some involved in the debate have
   proclaimed that the debate is scientifically settled and that only
   people holding personal Interests and biases oppose these ``established
   truths.{''} We review the historical similarities found in the 1950s
   comic book debate and studies identified from a Pub Med search of the
   term violent video games showing both the harmful and beneficial effects
   of these video games. We define factors that physicians need to consider
   when reading and stating opinions about this literature. Opinions from
   past court rulings are discussed to provide Insight Into how judges may
   approach the application of these social science studies to the current
   legal Issue. Although on the surface the case of Schwarzenegger v
   Entertainment Merchants Association pertains only to the restriction of
   violent video games, It may establish principles about how medical and
   public health testimony can affect fundamental constitutional rights and
   how much and on what basis the courts will defer to legislators'
   reliance on unsettled science.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   This paper considers in outline the complexity of the empathic process
   from subjective, philosophical and psychological perspectives, and
   suggests that compassionate empathy is a core requirement of a
   person-centred approach to health care delivery. Empathy is facilitated
   by secure attachments in infancy (intersubjectivity) and a subsequent
   firm sense of self and personal identity. Empathic understanding is
   enhanced by the medical humanities, but the neglect of musical
   appreciation in this regard is surprising.
   Conclusions
   The biopsychosocial model is reviewed, and a body-mind-spirit paradigm
   is proposed as a more optimal framework for health care delivery in a
   multicultural society.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing interviews with students and a key administrator, analyses of
   academic schedules, and observations of courses, labs, and small groups,
   this study examines if and how elements of the explicit preclinical
   curriculum may have deleterious effects on medical students'
   humanitarian attributes, namely empathy. Findings from this case-study
   of a medical school in the United States suggest that the lack of
   frequent formal testing in the psycho-social aspects of patient care
   during the preclinical years, as well as a general reduction in
   curriculum hours devoted to teaching the social aspects of medicine, may
   serve as mechanisms behind the diminution of medical students' levels of
   empathy and other positive attributes as found by previous research.
   Following the basic tenets of the Testing Effect and the assumption that
   assessment drives learning, it is argued that a feasible way to maintain
   and potentially cultivate these traits among medical students, without
   saturating an overwhelmed medical curriculum, would be to install
   periodic, formally graded exams into preclinical curriculums that
   evaluate empathy and the psycho-social aspects of care.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the factors that
   make a good doctor, both from a patient and a physician perspective. Is
   there a connection between practicing homeopathy and being a good
   doctor?
   Methods: This was a qualitative study of homeopathically trained
   physicians and their patients, using observation of patient-physician
   interactions (n = 29) and interviews with patients (n = 20) and with
   physicians (n = 4).
   Results: Patients identified the availability of time, both in itself
   and as a prerequisite for other physician characteristics, as the single
   most important factor. Other factors include scope of diagnosis/holistic
   approach, patient-centeredness/empathy, and perceived
   competence/therapeutic success. Patients did not link these factors to
   the homeopathic orientation of their physician, while physicians clearly
   made this connection.
   Conclusions: The findings confirm other studies of patient satisfaction
   and physician characteristics. The availability of time, a holistic
   approach, and high physician empathy lead to high patient satisfaction.
   Homeopathic physicians probably are more likely to exhibit these
   characteristics.
   Practice implications: Health care policy should create conditions that
   enable individual physicians to be ``good doctors.{''} For medical
   education, a stronger emphasis on interpersonal skills and practitioner
   empathy could lead to higher patient satisfaction and potentially better
   treatment outcomes. Homeopathy might provide a good role model for this
   type of education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the preferences of children with cancer, their
   parents, and survivors of childhood cancer regarding medical
   communication with child patients and variables associated with these
   preferences.
   Methods: Preferences regarding health-care provider empathy in
   consultations, and children's involvement in information exchange and
   medical decision making were investigated by means of vignettes.
   Vignettes are brief descriptions of hypothetical situations, in which
   important factors are systematically varied following an experimental
   design. In total, 1440 vignettes were evaluated by 34 children with
   cancer (aged 8-16), 59 parents, and 51 survivors (aged 8-16 at
   diagnosis, currently aged 10-30). Recruitment of participants took place
   in three Dutch university-based pediatric oncology centers. Data were
   analyzed by multilevel analyses.
   Results: Patients, parents, and survivors indicated the importance of
   health-care providers' empathy in 81\% of the described situations. In
   most situations (70\%), the three respondent groups preferred
   information about illness and treatment to be given to patients and
   parents simultaneously. Preferences regarding the amount of information
   provided to patients varied. The preference whether or not to shield
   patients from information was mainly associated with patients' age and
   emotionality. In most situations (71\%), the three respondent groups
   preferred children to participate in medical decision making. This
   preference was mainly associated with patients' age.
   Conclusions: To be able to adapt communication to parents' and patients'
   preferences, health-care providers should repeatedly assess the
   preferences of both groups. Future studies should investigate how
   health-care providers balance their communication between the sometimes
   conflicting preferences of patients and parents. Copyright (C) 2010 John

Abstract = {{Emotions-one's own and others'-play a large role in the lives of medical
   students. Students must deal with their emotional reactions to
   intellectual and physical stress, the demanding clinical situations to
   which they are witness, as well as patients' and patients' family
   members' often intense feelings. Yet, currently few components in formal
   medical training-in either direct curricular instruction or physician
   role modeling-focus on the emotional lives of students. In this article,
   the author examines patients', medical students', and physician role
   models' emotions in the clinical context, highlighting challenges in all
   three of these arenas. Next, the author asserts that the preponderance
   of medical education continues to address the emotional realm through
   ignoring, detaching from, and distancing from emotions. Finally, she
   presents not only possible theoretical and conceptual models for
   developing ways of understanding, attending to, and ultimately ``working
   with{''} emotions in medical education but also examples of innovative
   curricular efforts to incorporate emotional awareness into medical
   student training. The author concludes with the hope that medical
   educators will consider making a concerted effort to acknowledge
   emotions and their importance in medicine and medical training.}},

Title = {{Humanism at Heart: Preserving Empathy in Third-Year Medical Students}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Research suggests that medical student empathy erodes during
   undergraduate medical education. The authors evaluated the Jefferson
   Scale of Physician Empathy Medical Student Version (JSPE-MS) scores of
   two consecutive medical school classes to assess the impact of an
   educational intervention on the preservation of empathy.
   Method
   The authors conducted a before-and-after study of 209 Robert Wood
   Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) students enrolled in the classes of 2009
   and 2010. Students' clerkships included a mandatory, longitudinal
   ``Humanism and Professionalism{''} (H\&P) component, which included
   blogging about clerkship experiences, debriefing after significant
   events, and discussing journal articles, fiction, and film. Students
   completed the JSPE-MS during their first and last clerkships.
   Results
   The results showed that (1) contrary to previous studies' findings,
   third-year students did not show significant decline in empathy as
   measured by the JSPE-MS (these students, from two consecutive RWJMS
   classes, experienced the H\&P intervention), (2) students selected for
   the Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) were significantly different from
   their peers in empathy scores as measured by JSPE-MS, and (3) knowledge
   of selection for the GHHS seems to positively influence students'
   JSPE-MS scores.
   Conclusions
   Maintaining empathy during the third year of medical school is possible
   through educational intervention. A curriculum that includes safe,
   protected time for third-year students to discuss their reactions to
   patient care situations during clerkships may have contributed to the
   preservation of empathy. Programs designed to validate humanism in

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To test the hypothesis that physicians' empathy is associated with
   positive clinical outcomes for diabetic patients.
   Method
   A correlational study design was used in a university-affiliated
   outpatient setting. Participants were 891 diabetic patients, treated
   between July 2006 and June 2009, by 29 family physicians. Results of the
   most recent hemoglobin A1c and LDL-C tests were extracted from the
   patients' electronic records. The results of hemoglobin A1c tests were
   categorized into good control (< 7.0\%) and poor control (> 9.0\%).
   Similarly, the results of the LDL-C tests were grouped into good control
   (< 100) and poor control (> 130). The physicians, who completed the
   Jefferson Scale of Empathy in 2009, were grouped into high, moderate,
   and low empathy scorers. Associations between physicians' level of
   empathy scores and patient outcomes were examined.
   Results
   Patients of physicians with high empathy scores were significantly more
   likely to have good control of hemoglobin A1c (56\%) than were patients
   of physicians with low empathy scores (40\%, P < .001). Similarly, the
   proportion of patients with good LDL-C control was significantly higher
   for physicians with high empathy scores (59\%) than physicians with low
   scores (44\%, P < .001). Logistic regression analyses indicated that
   physicians' empathy had a unique contribution to the prediction of
   optimal clinical outcomes after controlling for physicians' and
   patients' gender and age, and patients' health insurance.
   Conclusions
   The hypothesis of a positive relationship between physicians' empathy
   and patients' clinical outcomes was confirmed, suggesting that
   physicians' empathy is an important factor associated with clinical
   competence and patient outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to determine perceived quality of care (PQC) in
   patients with multiple chronic conditions, whose care is structured in
   Andalusia (Spain) under polypathological patients (PP) care process, and
   identifying aspects for its improvement. The study was a community-based
   cross-sectional survey carried out in 4 primary care centers (which
   attended a total of 62,702 adults, of them, 662 were actively identified
   as PP). Finally, 461 PP and their caregivers were interviewed (69\% of
   eligible population) including assessment of PQC following SERVQUAL
   model, clinical and demographical data. On a five-point Likert scale
   (from 1, `much worse than expected'; to 5, `much better'), PQC rated
   3.68 +/- 0.59 (+/- S.D.). Independent PQC predictors were: empathy for
   family physician, identifying nurses, presence of peripheral artery
   disease or diabetes mellitus with vascular complications, and not having
   functional limitations. In this population-based survey, PP attended at
   primary care have an acceptable PQC. Measures aimed to lessening
   functional deterioration, supporting dependent patients, and improving
   relationship between PP and their healthcare professionals could
   increase PQC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Do not attempt resuscitation: the importance of consensual decisions A
   qualitative study}},
Journal = {{SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{AIMS: To describe the involvement and input of physicians and nurses in
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR / do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR)
   decisions; to analyse decision patterns; and understand the practical
   implications.
   DESIGN: A Qualitative Grounded Theory study using one-time open-ended
   interviews with 40 volunteer physicians and 52 nurses drawn from acute
   care wards with mixes of heterogeneous cases in seven different
   hospitals in German-speaking Switzerland.
   RESULTS: Establishing DNAR orders in the best interests of patients was
   described as a challenging task requiring the leadership of senior
   physicians and nurses. Implicit decisions in favour of CPR predominated
   at the beginning of hospitalisation; depending on the context, they were
   relieved/superseded by explicit DNAR decisions. Explicit decisions were
   the result of hierarchical medical expertise, of multilateral
   interdisciplinary expertise, of patient autonomy and/or of negotiated
   patient autonomy. Each type of decision, implicit or explicit,
   potentially represented a team consensus. Non-consensual decisions were
   prone to precipitate personal or team conflicts, and, occasionally, led
   to non-compliance.
   CONCLUSION: Establishing DNAR orders is a demanding task. Reaching a
   consensus is of crucial importance in guaranteeing teamwork and good
   patient care. Communication and negotiation skills, professional and
   personal life experience and empathy for patients and colleagues are
   pivotal. Therefore, leadership by experienced senior physicians and
   nurses is needed and great efforts should be made with regard to
   multidisciplinary education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Patient-centered interviewing is an increasingly important
   aspect of medical education. One way to quantify this skill is the Four
   Habits Model, which helps to organize medical interviewing. The Four
   Habits are: invest in the beginning, elicit the patient's perspective,
   demonstrate empathy and invest in the end. In a previous study at our
   institution, students were competent in all of the habits but
   ``eliciting the patient's perspective{''} during a standardized patient
   case. Based on this study, we hypothesized that the students' poor
   performance could be related to the type of case or to clinical
   experience.
   Methods: We placed three ``eliciting the patient's perspective{''} items
   on the checklist for two standardized patients, one with and one without
   a clear diagnosis. We planned to compare group performance between cases
   and semesters of the third year. We hypothesized that students would be
   more patient-centered earlier in the year and with an ambiguous
   diagnosis.
   Results: Students were more patient-centered with the ambiguous
   diagnosis and later in their third year. Patient-centeredness was
   measured by an eliciting the patient's perspective (EPP) score based on
   the checklist items.
   Conclusion: Our results provide information that may help guide
   curriculum development and future study to advance patient-centered
   interviewing skills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Psychiatric training was once synonymous with learning
   psychotherapy, but current psychiatric trainees face many options for
   integrating psychopharmacology and psychotherapy into their future
   practices, including providing primarily medication-focused visits. We
   examined psychiatry residents' attitudes towards learning psychotherapy,
   practicing psychotherapy in the future, and overall identification as
   psychotherapists.
   METHODS: We surveyed residents from 15 US residency programs during
   2006-2007. The survey included 36 Likert-scaled items inquiring about
   residents' attitudes towards their psychotherapy training and
   supervision, their level of psychotherapy competence, the role of
   psychotherapy in their psychiatric identity, and their future practice
   plans. Four items asked about personal psychotherapy experience. Here we
   describe findings related to attitudes concerning being a
   psychotherapist and future practice plans.
   RESULTS: Among 249 respondents, most (82\%) viewed becoming a
   psychotherapist as integral to their psychiatric identity. Fifty-four
   percent planned to provide formal psychotherapy, whereas 62\%
   anticipated psychopharmacology would be the foundation of treatment for
   most patients. Residents with personal psychotherapy experience and
   first-year postgraduate residents (PGY-1) were more likely to identify
   as psychotherapists, plan to pursue further psychotherapy training
   postresidency, and anticipate psychotherapy being central to their
   future practice.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns about the diminishing role of
   psychotherapy in the practice of psychiatry and in psychiatrists'
   professional identity, most psychiatric residents view psychotherapy as
   integral to their professional identities and future practice plans.}},

Title = {{Is pain patients' psychophysiological arousal while watching their
   videotaped medical interview similar to their arousal during
   participation in this medical interview?}},

Abstract = {{Showing videos of medical consultation as a proxy for participation is
   being increasingly applied in research in order to let patients
   (re-)experience social interaction in medical settings. If subjects do
   indeed experience the interaction process when watching this on video,
   then they should show similar patterns in physiological arousal as when
   actually participating. We assessed whether watching one's own
   interaction in a medical setting on video lead to the same skin
   conductance activity (SC) as when participating in that interaction.
   Fifteen women with fibromyalgia participated in a medical interview and,
   after a break, watched the video of this interview. Skin conductance
   activity was measured throughout the medical interview and, again, while
   the participants watched their own video. Coherence in SC between these
   two conditions was assessed. In eleven subjects (73\%) a significant
   positive coherence between the two measurements was found, indicating
   that watching your own videotaped consultations evokes comparable
   psychophysiological arousal in most but not all participants. This
   physiological coherence might be an indication that people are capable
   of re-experiencing their interaction process by watching replays of
   these situations, although further research is needed. The positive
   coherence also supports skin conductance as a reliable moment-to-moment
   measure for physiological arousal throughout the doctor-patient
   interaction process. The next step should be linking the changes in
   physiological arousal to what exactly is happening at that moment in the
   interaction between doctor and patient This could provide support for
   the validity of experimental designs in which standardized videotaped
   medical visits are shown to patients. More research is needed on
   predictors of (non-) coherence in certain subjects. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is growing interest to understand the role of
   positive psychological features on the outcomes of medical illnesses.
   Unfortunately this topic is less studied in relation to mental health,
   and almost completely neglected in relation to one of the most common
   severe psychiatric illnesses, bipolar disorder. Certain specific
   psychological characteristics, that are generally viewed as valuable and
   beneficial morally or socially, may grow out of the experience of having
   this affective disorder.
   Objective: We describe the sources, research and impact of these
   positive psychological traits in the lives of persons with bipolar
   disorder based on the few published literature available to date. These
   include, but are not limited to: spirituality, empathy, creativity,
   realism, and resilience. Methods: After an extensive search in the
   literature, we found 81 articles that involve descriptions of positive
   psychological characteristics of bipolar disorder.
   Results: We found evidence for enhancement of the five above positive
   psychological traits in persons with bipolar disorder.
   Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is associated with the positive
   psychological traits of spirituality, empathy, creativity, realism, and
   resilience. Clinical and research attention to preserving and enhancing
   these traits may improve outcomes in bipolar disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: A challenging but main task for clinicians is to identify
   patients' concerns related to their medical conditions. The study aim
   was to validate a new coding scheme for identifying patients' cues and
   concerns.
   Methods: 12 videotaped consultations between nurses and pain patients
   were coded according to the Verona Coding Scheme for Emotional Sequences
   (VR-CoDES). During a metainterview each patient watched his/her own
   video interview with the researcher to confirm or disconfirm the
   identified cues and concerns. A directive or an open format was applied.
   Quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed.
   Results: Patients' confirmation in relation to the coding gave a
   sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.99 in the directive format and
   a sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.70 applying the open format.
   Through a qualitative analysis 83\% of researcher-identified cues and
   concerns were validated. 17\% were not confirmed or uncertain.
   Conclusion: The VR-CoDES seems to capture what are experienced as real
   concerns to patients, and proves to be a coding scheme with a high
   degree of ecological validity.
   Practice implications: The VR-CoDES provides a valid framework for
   detecting patients' cues and concerns, and should be explored as a
   training tool to develop clinicians' empathic accuracy. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective: This qualitative study of health care clinicians serving
   women at heightened risk of sexually transmitted infections and
   unintended pregnancy was undertaken to explore concepts underlying
   reproductive health counseling messages in clinical encounters.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 clinicians,
   including physicians and advanced practice nurses serving primarily
   low-income patients in high-risk communities throughout the U.S.
   Results: Most of the clinicians describe their influence on patients and
   protective behaviors as derived from medical authority and the
   presentation of information. The use of a parental style of authority,
   particularly for young or vulnerable patients, and emotional appeals to
   evoke negative emotions, such as fear, were also used to motivate
   protective behaviors. Many clinicians highlighted the importance of
   empathy, and understanding the cultural and social context of health
   behaviors. A few clinicians described innovative efforts to empower
   women to protect themselves and exert more control in relationships.
   Conclusion: Some of the reproductive health counseling approaches
   described by clinicians are not consistent with leading health behavior
   change theories or patient-centered counseling.
   Practical implications: To improve counseling, these messages and
   concepts need to be evaluated for effectiveness, and possibly used to
   inform the development of novel theories for use in reproductive health
   counseling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Methods: In a prospective observational study we documented existing
   anaesthesiological pre-information and previous experience of 461
   patients (255w/206m) individually. In addition, we recorded the
   affective emotional condition of each patient before and after the
   premedication visit via a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a test of
   current stress (KAB).
   Results: 248 patients had previous anaesthesiological pre-information.
   Of those 61 were of a negative nature. These patients showed a
   significantly higher level of stress and anxiety compared to those with
   positive information. 41 of 388 patients reported bad experiences with
   increased anxiety and stress. The premedication visits caused a
   significant attenuation of the overall stress level in patients with
   negative experience/information.
   Conclusion: During the individual premedication visit, patients should
   be asked directly about negative pre-information and perioperative
   experience. Thus the conversation can be customised to the individual
   stress factors and show empathy as well. Independent of any medical
   intervention, this approach can be an effective contribution to stress
   reduction.}},

Title = {{Looking for winds of change with a PBL scenario about communication and
   empathy}},
Journal = {{HEALTHMED}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{515-521}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Good communication is associated with improved health of patients
   and empathy is a cornerstone of physician-patient communication. Medical
   education seems to be ineffective in helping students to maintain or
   increase their empathy. Some of benefits of Problem Based Learning (PBL)
   are about communication and interpersonal skills. This study aims to
   determine the effect of a PBL scenario on attitudes towards
   communication skills, the empathic tendency and the empathic skills of
   1st year medical students.
   Materials and Methods: Attitude changes after the PBL scenario were
   evaluated via Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS), Empathic
   Tendency Scale (ETS) and Empathic Skill Scale (ESS).
   Results: The positive attitude change was significant for male students
   (p=0.03). The means of ETS scores were 68.42 +/- 8.28 and 69.18 +/- 8.53
   (p=0.36) and the means of ESS scores were 131.16 +/- 17.28 and 133.30
   +/- 18.35 in the pre and post-tests, respectively (p=0.22). The ESS
   scores of male students both in pre and post tests were significantly
   higher than female students (p=0.00). A significant negative correlation
   between NAS and ETS and a positive correlation between PAS and ETS in
   both tests were determined.
   Conclusion: This scenario significantly increased positive attitudes
   (PAS) of students towards communication skills. There was also an
   increase in empathic tendency and skills.}},

Title = {{Qualitative Analysis of Medical Student Impressions of a Narrative
   Exercise in the Third-Year Psychiatry Clerkship}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Clinical clerkship directors and faculty undertake the challenge of
   teaching patient-centered communication to students who face the
   enormous doctor-centered task of learning diagnostic medicine. The
   authors examined students' written reactions to the narrative exercise,
   which, drawing from narrative medicine and narrative therapy, challenges
   students to be more patient-centered by writing a patient's life story
   and sharing it with that patient.
   Method
   During one-half of an academic year (2008-2009), the authors used
   qualitative methods to explore the range of medical student experiences
   with the narrative exercise in the psychiatry clerkship.
   Results
   During the study period, 46 medical students completed the exercise, and
   44 (96\%) submitted 367 comments for the research team to analyze. Four
   broad categories emerged: (1) communication, (2) insight, (3) hope, and
   (4) mixed or negative reactions. The most common theme was improved
   communication, which comprised the subcategories of enhanced active
   listening, opening up, and relationship building. Improved insights
   included student insights into their patients, as well as the
   facilitation of patient insights into themselves, especially regarding
   their own strengths and relationships. The exercise was well received by
   students: Only five comments were categorized as negative, and all of
   these related to difficulties selecting patients.
   Conclusions
   Students reported many examples of improved patient-centered
   communication facilitated by the exercise. The narrative exercise may
   also promote a greater understanding of patients as complete human
   beings rather than diagnostic entities. The approach may be useful in
   educational settings beyond the psychiatry clerkship.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To validate the Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Health Profession
   Students version (JSE-HPS) in pharmacy students.
   Methods. The JSE-HPS (20 items), adapted from the original Jefferson
   Scale of Empathy for use among students in the healthcare professions,
   was completed by 187 first-year pharmacy students at Midwestern
   University Chicago College of Pharmacy.
   Results. Two factors, ``perspective-taking{''} and ``compassionate
   care,{''} emerged from factor analysis in this study, accounting for
   31\% and 8\% of the variance, respectively. These factors are similar to
   the prominent ones reported in previous research involving physicians
   and medical students, supporting the construct validity of this
   instrument for pharmacy students. In the current study, mean JSE-HPS
   score was comparable to those reported for medical students, and
   consistent with previous findings with medical students and physicians.
   Women scored significantly higher than men.
   Conclusions. Findings support the construct validity and reliability of
   the JSE-HPS for measuring empathy in pharmacy students.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in cognitive psychology inform us that the recall of information
   and its application are best when it is taught and rehearsed in
   environments similar to workplace. The healthcare professions are
   heavily task- and performance-based where non-technical skills, decision
   making and clinical reasoning are important alongside integrity, empathy
   and compassion. Most of these attributes are difficult to teach and
   assess in the traditional classrooms. Enhanced patient safety on one
   hand has to be the ultimate outcome of any medical curriculum while on
   the other hand, it itself can be potentially compromised in an
   apprenticeship-based model of medical education. A range of simulation
   techniques are very well placed to be used alongside clinical
   placements. These can be employed to enhance learning of healthcare
   professionals in safe environments, without compromising the patient
   safety, while maintaining a high degree of realism. This article builds
   an argument for the use of simulation techniques to enhance patient
   safety and points the readers to the AMEE Guide No. 50<SU1</SU on
   simulation, which is written as a practical manual on building a
   simulation programme in healthcare education.</.}},

Title = {{Wooden's pyramid: Building a hierarchy of skills for successful
   communication}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-43}},
Abstract = {{Background: John Wooden, the legendary college basketball coach, created
   the ``Pyramid of Success{''}, which he constructed from 14 timeless
   character traits and interpersonal skills that are critical to
   competitive greatness. Wooden's pyramid is a powerful symbol that he and
   others have used for several decades as an educational tool to promote
   leadership and teamwork.
   Aim: This article proposes the ``Pyramid of Relational Excellence
   (PRE){''}, patterned after Wooden's pyramid, as a mnemonic-based
   educational symbol for communication skills training.
   Method: Literature review, personal reflection.
   Results: The PRE is constructed of four tiers with a total of 12
   building blocks, with each successive tier built upon the one beneath
   it. The building blocks represent fundamental elements that are known to
   be critical to successful communication.
   Conclusions: The PRE is process oriented rather than task oriented and
   focuses exclusively on the face-to-face encounter. It therefore
   complements established communications curricula, such as the UK
   communication wheel and others, which are more comprehensive and task
   oriented. The PRE is constructed of timeless, fundamental principles. It
   is therefore particularly well suited for training medical students and
   residents.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is necessary for communication between patients and
   physicians to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.
   Aim: To examine associations between Simulated Patients' (SPs)
   assessment of medical students' empathy and the students' self-reported
   empathy.
   Methods: A total of 248 third-year medical students completed the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE). SPs completed the Jefferson
   Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE), and a global
   rating of empathy in 10 objective clinical skills examination encounters
   during a comprehensive end of third-year clinical skills examination.
   Results: High correlation was found between the scores on the JSPPPE and
   the global ratings of empathy completed by the SPs (r=0.87, p<0.01). A
   moderate but statistically significant correlation was observed between
   scores of the JSPE and the JSPPPE (r=0.19, p<0.05). Significant
   differences were observed on the JSPE and global ratings of empathy
   among top, middle and low scorers on the JSPPPE in the expected
   direction.
   Conclusions: While significant associations exist between students'
   self-reported scores on the JSPE and SPs' evaluations of students'
   empathy, the associations are not large enough to conclude that the two
   evaluations are redundant.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Background: The communication of empathy is key in physician-patient
   interactions. We introduced drama training in ``How to act-in-role'' to
   medical students and evaluated the effect of this.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental design was employed, with 72 students in
   the control and 77 students in the intervention group. The students'
   empathy scores were obtained using the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy (JSPE) during the introductory course. Both groups received
   tutorials in motivational interviewing and brief intervention skills.
   The students in the intervention group also received training in ``How
   to act-in-role''. The JSPE was repeated for both groups. The students
   subsequently undertook observed structured clinical examinations (OSCE).
   Both tutors and students evaluated the student's OSCE performance as
   well as their motivational interviewing skills using the Behavior Change
   Counseling Index (BECCI).
   Results: Our findings show that while the students in both groups did
   not significantly differ in baseline empathy scores, the intervention
   group reported significantly higher empathy scores post-intervention.
   The intervention group also received significantly higher tutor ratings
   for their motivational interviewing (BECCI score) and overall OSCE
   performances. In conclusion, the teaching innovation ``How to
   act-in-role'' was effective not only in increasing medical students'
   self-reported empathy but also their competence in consultation skills.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Physicians require communications training to improve
   effective and compassionate care. Clinicians discuss challenging
   communication issues in existing hospital ``Schwartz Rounds.'
   Aims: To improve communication skills, the Warren Alpert Medical School
   of Brown University designed ``Schwartz Communication Sessions'' for the
   mandatory 2-year pre-clerkship Doctoring course. Alongside learning
   interviewing, physical examination, and professionalism skills, the new
   Schwartz curriculum provides medical students with the rationale and
   proficiency for effective communication with patients, families and the
   healthcare team.
   Methods: First-year students experience a graduated curriculum of three
   sessions on themes such as empathy and professionalism using innovative
   methods. Sessions highlight cases and videos depicting successful and
   ineffective interactions, large and small group discussions, role play
   and skills practice, guest patient presentations, and multi-disciplinary
   panels. The second-year students' session focuses on communications with
   challenging patients.
   Results: Students and faculty rate the sessions highly on effectiveness
   of enhancing communication skills, gaining perspective in healthcare
   communication, and appreciating the complexities of healthcare
   situations. Expansion of the program using case-based sessions for
   clerkship students is planned for a continuous and graduated experience.
   Conclusions: Integrating a pre-clerkship communications curriculum may
   help improve future physicians' interactions with patients and families.
   Implications of this curriculum for medical education are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Physician empathy and relational skills are critical factors predicting
   quality of care, patient safety, patient satisfaction, and decreasing
   malpractice claims. Studies indicate that physician empathy declines
   throughout medical training, yet little is published about methods to
   enhance empathy, especially in surgical residency training. The
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires
   competencies in 6 areas, including interpersonal skills and
   communication. To address this important problem, the first author
   developed an innovative empathy-relational skills training protocol
   focusing on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of empathy and the
   interpersonal processes that positively affect the patient-doctor
   relationship. The authors tested the effectiveness of this protocol in a
   pilot study with 11 otolaryngology residents. Results showed that a
   brief series of 3 empathy training sessions can significantly improve
   physicians' knowledge of the neurobiology and physiology of empathy, as
   well as their self-reported capacity to empathize with patients. A trend
   toward increased patient satisfaction was observed.}},

   Curriculum Knowledge with Emotional and Reflective Development}},
Journal = {{PAIN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{186-195}},
Abstract = {{Objective.
   Improvements in clinical pain care have not matched advances in
   scientific knowledge, and innovations in medical education are needed.
   Several streams of evidence indicate that pain education needs to
   address both the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain. Our aim was
   to design and deliver a new course in pain establishing foundation-level
   knowledge while comprehensively addressing the emotional development
   needs in this area.
   Setting.
   One hundred eighteen first-year medical students at Johns Hopkins School
   of Medicine.
   Outcome Measures.
   Performance was measured by multiple-choice tests of pain knowledge,
   attendance, reflective pain portfolios, and satisfaction measures.
   Results.
   Domains of competence in pain knowledge included central and peripheral
   pain signalling, pharmacological management of pain with standard
   analgesic medications, neuromodulating agents, and opioids; cancer pain,
   musculoskeletal pain, nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic, geriatric,
   and pediatric pain. Socio-emotional development (portfolio) work focused
   on increasing awareness of pain affect in self and others, and on
   enhancing the commitment to excellence in pain care. Reflections
   included observations on a brief pain experience (cold pressor test),
   the multidimensionality of pain, the role of empathy and compassion in
   medical care, the positive characteristics of pain-care role models, the
   complex feelings engendered by pain and addiction including frustration
   and disappointment, and aspirations and commitments in clinical
   medicine. The students completing feedback expressed high levels of
   interest in pain medicine as a result of the course.
   Discussion.
   We conclude that a 4-day pain course incorporating sessions with pain
   specialists, pain medicine knowledge, and design-built elements to
   strengthen emotional skills is an effective educational approach.
   Summary.
   Innovations in medical education about pain are needed. Our aim was to
   design and deliver a new course for medical students addressing both the
   affective and cognitive dimensions of pain. Combining small-group
   sessions with pain specialists, active-learning approaches to pain
   knowledge, and design-built elements to strengthen emotional skills was
   highly effective.}},

   objective was to describe curricula of new Web-based electives about
   pain for undergraduate medical education.
   Design. We created three interactive Web-based elective courses about
   pain targeted to medical and dental students. ``The Puzzle of Pain{''}
   course introduced basic concepts of pain and neurobiology of pain. The
   humanities-based curriculum of ``Empathy and Pain{''} taught students
   about emotional aspects of pain and empathetic responses. ``The Cochrane
   Library and Pain{''} course introduced students to the concept of
   evidence-based medicine, critical appraisal of the literature, and the
   hierarchy of evidence in medicine.
   Outcome Measures. We measured program effectiveness with a
   pretest/posttest instrument and student satisfaction survey.
   Results. Mean knowledge scores increased significantly after the program
   and overall evaluations were positive.
   Conclusions. Delivering the pain electives for medical students in an
   online format was an efficient educational method, with high student
   satisfaction scores. Medical educators should consider online electives
   for medical students in pain studies as well as in other content areas.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with advanced cancer often experience negative emotion;
   clinicians' empathic responses can alleviate patient distress. Much is
   known about how physicians respond to patient emotion; less is known
   about non-physician clinicians. Given that oncology care is increasingly
   provided by an interdisciplinary team, it is important to know more
   about how patients with advanced cancer express emotions to
   non-physician clinicians (NPCs) and how NPCs respond to those empathic
   opportunities.
   We audio recorded conversations between non-physician clinicians and
   patients with advanced cancer. We analyzed 45 conversations between
   patients and oncology physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and
   nurse clinicians in which patients or their loved ones expressed at
   least one negative emotion to the NPC (i.e., an empathic opportunity).
   Empathic opportunities were coded three ways: type of emotion (anger,
   sadness, or fear), severity of emotion (least, moderate, or most
   severe), and NPC response to emotion (not empathic, on-topic medical
   response, and empathic response).
   We identified 103 empathic opportunities presented to 25 different NPCs
   during 45 visits. Approximately half of the empathic opportunities
   contained anger (53\%), followed by sadness (25\%) and fear (21\%). The
   majority of emotions expressed were moderately severe (73\%), followed
   by most severe (16\%), and least severe (12\%). The severity of emotions
   presented was not found to be statistically different between types of
   NPCs. NPCs responded to empathic opportunities with empathic statements
   30\% of the time. Additionally, 40\% of the time, NPCs responded to
   empathic opportunities with on-topic, medical explanations and 30\% of
   the responses were not empathic.
   Patients expressed emotional concerns to NPCs typically in the form of
   anger; most emotions were moderately severe, with no statistical
   differences among types of NPC. On average, NPCs responded to patient
   emotion with empathic language only 30\% of the time. A better
   understanding of NPC-patient interactions can contribute to improved
   communication training for NPCs and, ultimately, to higher quality
   patient care in cancer.}},

Title = {{Assessing Quality of Educational Service by the SERVQUAL model:
   Viewpoints of Paramedical Students at Tehran University of Medical

Abstract = {{Introduction: Understanding how the students' expectations about the
   process of educational services is being met, plays an important role in
   improving the quality education and academic services in the higher
   learning institutes; because by determining the probable gaps between
   the expectations and perceptions of students, necessary actions can be
   undertaken to enhance the quality of educational services.
   Purpose: This study intends to determine the quality gap in educational
   services provided to the paramedical students in Tehran University of
   Medical Sciences in 2010.
   Method: The study was a cross sectional research that used standard
   SERVQUAL questionnaire to collect data from paramedical students of the
   school of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical
   Sciences. A total of 135 responses were analyzed to identify the quality
   gap in educational services.
   Findings: Results show that there is a negative quality gap in all five
   dimensions of quality educational services (empathy, physical,
   responsiveness, assurance and confidence). The maximum and minimum mean
   of quality gap observed in the dimension of empathy and assurance was
   -1.57 and -1.31 respectively. Moreover, a statistically significant
   difference was observed between the five dimensions of educational
   services in the quality gap (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: According to the results, it is recommended that in order to
   reduce the gap and improve the quality of educational services,
   attention should be paid to all aspects of service quality, particularly
   to the empathy dimension. It is also suggested that proper planning is
   needed to better serve employees and increase their communication
   skills, in order to help reduce the educational quality gap.
   Originality/value: The concept of service quality assessment through
   SERVQUAL is a relatively new effort among Iranian universities, and
   there is lack of previous published literature using this method to
   assess the quality of educational services. Thus, this paper can be used
   as a guide for universities and academic institutes who seek to identify
   the educational quality gap in order to improve upon it.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Early introduction of a full-day human factors training
   experience into the surgical clerkship curriculum will teach effective
   communication skills and strategies to gain professional satisfaction
   from a career in surgery.
   Design: In pilot 1, which took place between July 1, 2007, and December
   31, 2008, 50 students received training and 50 did not; all received
   testing at the end of the rotation for comparison of control vs
   intervention group performance. In pilot 2, a total of 50 students were
   trained and received testing before and after rotation to examine
   individual change over time.
   Setting: University of Massachusetts Medical School.
   Participants: A total of 148 third-year medical students in required
   12-week surgical clerkship rotations.
   Interventions: Full-day training with lecture and small-group exercises,
   cotaught by surgeons and educators, with focus on empathetic
   communication, time management, and teamwork skills.
   Main Outcome Measures: Empathetic communication skill, teamwork, and
   patient safety attitudes and selfreported use of time management
   strategies.
   Results: Empathy scores were not higher for trained vs untrained groups
   in pilot 1 but improved from 2.32 to 3.45 on a 5-point scale (P < .001)
   in pilot 2. Students also were more likely to ask for the nurse's
   perspective and to seek agreement on an action plan after team
   communication training (pilot 1, f = 7.52, P =. 007; pilot 2, t = 2.65,
   P =. 01). Results were mixed for work-life balance, with some trained
   groups scoring significantly lower than untrained groups in pilot 1 and
   no significant improvement shown in pilot 2.
   Conclusions: The significant increase in student-patient communication
   scores suggests that a brief focused presentation followed by simulation
   of difficult patient encounters can be successful. A video demonstration
   can improve interdisciplinary teamwork.}},

Abstract = {{The renewal of primary care waits just ahead. The patient-centered
   medical home (PCMH) movement and a refreshing breeze of collaboration
   signal its arrival with demonstration projects and pilots appearing
   across the country. An early message from this work suggests that the
   development of collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams may be essential
   for the success of the PCMH. Our focus in this article is on training
   existing health care professionals toward being thriving members of this
   transformed clinical care team in a relationship-centered PCMH. Our
   description of the optimal conditions for collaborative training begins
   with delineating three types of teams and how they relate to levels of
   collaboration. We then describe how to create a supportive, safe
   learning environment for this type of training, using a different model
   of professional socialization, and tools for building culture. Critical
   skills related to practice development and the cross-disciplinary
   collaborative processes are also included. Despite significant obstacles
   in readying current clinicians to be members of thriving collaborative
   teams, a few next steps toward implementing collaborative training
   programs for existing professionals are possible using competency-based
   and adult learning approaches. Grasping the long awaited arrival of
   collaborative primary health care will also require delivery system and
   payment reform. Until that happens, there is an abundance of work to be
   done envisioning new collaborative training programs and initiating a
   nation-wide effort to motivate and reeducate our colleagues.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate the empathic skills and the empathetic tendency of
   nursing students throughout their years of undergraduate education.
   Background: Empathy is a major component of the relationships between
   patients and nurses, and is an observable and teachable skill that
   nurses are claimed to possess.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed to determine the
   differences in the empathic skills and tendency of nursing students in
   the successive years of undergraduate nursing education. A longitudinal
   study was also designed to evaluate the changes between the beginning
   and the end of the nursing education in the same group. All the
   registered students were asked to participate in the study. The total
   population was 466 nursing students of whom 438 participated (94\%) in
   the cross-sectional study and 81 in the longitudinal study. The Empathic
   Communication Skills Scale (ECSS) and the Empathic Tendency Scale (ETS)
   were used to collect data.
   Findings: An increase in the ECSS and a decrease in the ETS were
   observed in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Comparing
   the years, fourth-year students have higher empathic skills level,
   whereas newly registered students have a higher empathic tendency score
   (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The findings have shown that empathic skills developed
   during undergraduate nursing education. However, empathetic tendency has
   shown a decline during these educational years. The decrease in
   empathetic tendency during undergraduate education should be taken into
   account, and educators and researchers should consider possible reasons
   for this outcome. Further research is indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   patients' attitudes about buprenorphine treatment in office-based and
   opioid treatment program (OTP) settings.
   Methods: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 29 patients
   with coexisting HIV infection and opioid dependence seeking
   buprenorphine maintenance therapy in office-based and OTP settings. We
   used thematic analysis of transcribed audiorecorded interviews to
   identify themes.
   Results: Patients voiced a strong preference for office-based treatment.
   Four themes emerged to explain this preference. First, patients
   perceived the greater convenience of office-based treatment as improving
   their ability to address HIV and other healthcare issues. Second, they
   perceived a strong patient-focused orientation in patient- provider
   relationships, underpinning their preference for office- based care.
   This was manifested as increased trust, listening, empathy, and respect
   from office-based staff and providers. Third, they perceived shared
   power and responsibility in office-based settings. Finally, patients
   viewed office-based treatment as a more supportive environment for
   sobriety and relapse prevention. This was, in part, due to strong
   therapeutic alliances with office-based staff and providers who
   prioritized a harm reduction approach and also the perception that the
   office-based settings were ``safer{''} for sobriety, compared with
   increased opportunities for purchasing and using illicit opiates in OTP
   settings.
   Conclusions: HIV-infected patients with opioid dependence preferred
   office-based buprenorphine, because they perceived it as offering a more
   patient-centered approach to care compared with OTP referral.
   Office-based buprenorphine may facilitate engagement in care for
   patients with coexisting opioid dependence and HIV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Homeopathy is a major modality in complementary and
   alternative medicine. Significant tensions exist between homeopathic
   practice and education, evident in the diversity of practice styles and
   pedagogic models. Utilizing clinical reasoning knowledge in conventional
   medicine and allied health sciences, this article seeks to identify and
   critique existing research in this important area.
   Materials and methods: A literature search utilizing MEDLINE (R), Allied
   and Complementary Medicine (AMED), and CINAHL (R) (Cumulative Index to
   Nursing and Allied Health Literature) was conducted. Key terms including
   clinical thinking, clinical reasoning, decision-making, homeopathy, and
   complementary medicine were utilized. A critical appraisal of the
   evidence was undertaken.
   Results: Four (4) studies have examined homeopathic clinical reasoning.
   Two (2) studies sought to measure and quantify homeopathic reasoning.
   One (1) study proposed a reasoning model, based on pattern recognition,
   hypothetico-deductive reasoning, intuition, and remedy-matching
   (PHIR-M), resembling much that has been previously mapped in
   conventional medical reasoning research. The fourth closely investigated
   the meaning and use of intuition in homeopathic decision-making.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these four studies provide valuable insight
   into what is currently known about homeopathic clinical reasoning.
   However, despite the history and breadth of practice, little is known
   about homeopathic clinical reasoning and decision-making. Building on
   the research would require viewing clinical reasoning not only as a
   cognitive phenomenon but also as a situated and interactive one. Further
   research into homeopathic clinical reasoning is indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Critiques of the dehumanising aspects of contemporary medical practice
   have generated increasing interest in the ways in which health care can
   foster a holistic sense of wellbeing. We examine the relationship
   between two areas of this humanistic endeavour: narrative and dignity.
   This paper makes two simple arguments that are intuitive but have not
   yet been explored in detail: that narrative competence of carers is
   required for maintaining or recreating dignity, and that dignity
   promotion in health care practice is primarily narrative in form. The
   multiple meanings that dignity has in a person's life are what give the
   concept power and can only be captured by narrative. This has
   implications for health care practice where narrative work will be
   increasingly required to support patient dignity in under-resourced and
   over-subscribed health care systems.}},

   as part of an innovative clinical experience. A defined visual art
   experience was used to improve professional nursing students'
   observational and communication skills, narrative sequencing abilities,
   and empathy. The nursing and medical literature describing the use of
   visual art encounters in health care education is reviewed. The
   incorporation of an art education program into the curriculum of a
   cohort of accelerated baccalaureate nursing students is described.
   Qualitative evaluation measures from the students suggest this was an
   experience that broadened their understanding of patient encounters.}},

Title = {{Lack of association between resident doctors' well-being and medical
   knowledge}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Resident doctors' (residents) well-being impacts on the medical care
   they provide. Despite the high prevalence of resident doctors' distress,
   the relationship between their well-being and the specific competencies
   defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education is
   poorly understood. We evaluated the association of resident well-being
   with medical knowledge as assessed on both a standardised test of
   general medical knowledge and at the end of web-based courses on a
   series of focused topics.
   Methods
   We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study of associations between
   well-being and medical knowledge scores over time for internal medicine
   residents from July 2004 to June 2007. Well-being measures included
   linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) scales measuring quality of life
   (including overall quality of life, mental, physical and emotional
   well-being, and fatigue), the Medical Outcome Study Eight-Item Short
   Form Health Survey (SF-8) assessment of mental and physical well-being,
   the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the PRIME-MD two-item depression
   screen. We also measured empathy using the perspective taking and
   empathic concern subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index.
   Medical knowledge measures included scores on web-based learning module
   post-tests and scores on the national Internal Medicine In-Training
   Examination (IM-ITE). As data for each association were available for at
   least 126 residents, this study was powered to detect a
   small-to-moderate effect size of 0.3 standard deviations.
   Results
   No statistically significant associations were observed between
   well-being and either web-based learning module post-test score or
   IM-ITE score. Parameter estimates of the association of well-being
   variables with knowledge scores were uniformly small. For all well-being
   metrics, meaningful differences were associated with knowledge score
   difference estimates of < 1 percentage point.
   Conclusions
   Resident well-being appears to have limited association with competence
   in medical knowledge as assessed following web-based courses on specific
   topics or using standardised general medical examinations.}},

Abstract = {{Autobiographical narratives of illness and disability are influential in
   popular and medical discourses of illness and disability, in part
   because these narratives represent illness and disability within a
   sociocultural context, intersecting with other categories of difference.
   Clinicians can benefit patients through a critical understanding of the
   formal and social conventions that shape illness and disability
   narratives and the effect these conventions can have on the lived
   experience of illness and disability. I analyze the 2003 edition of Lucy
   Grealy's Autobiography of a Face to illustrate these socio-narrative
   conventions, especially in fight of an afterword that significantly
   revises the ending to C realy's narrative. I explore the parallels
   between narrative conventions-such as the ``recovery narrative{''}-and
   caregivers' expectations that shape the role of the ``good patient,{''}
   as well as the resistance to conventions of closure, represented by the
   ``renegotiated ending.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Martin Buber's concept of inclusion and Gabriel Marcel's notion of
   availability are used to cast new light on the human dimension in
   medical care. Buber's notion of inclusion indicates that clinical
   empathy should involve both cognitive and affective elements. It is
   argued that empathy is more than simply labeling a feeling state.
   Including oneself in the inner reality of the patient involves
   recognizing what her suffering feels like. Marcel's work on availability
   is used to point out how crucially important it is for the clinician to
   open herself to the suffering of the patient if she is to offer
   genuinely compassionate care. Availability requires a fundamental
   openness to the other that Marcel refers to as ``in-cohesion{''} or
   porosity. This is identified as an essential quality in the caring
   clinician. Marcel's approach to overcoming a lack of compassion is also
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Improving medical students' attitudes towards the chronic sick: a role
   for social science research}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many medical students are negatively disposed toward the
   elderly and chronic sick. The present study assessed the impact of a
   community-based teaching initiative, the Life History Project, on
   students' attitudes to these groups.
   Methods: A questionnaire including Likert based responses and free text
   comments was distributed to all first-year MBChB students after
   completion of their Life History coursework. Data was analysed using
   SPSS and content analysis.
   Results: A high proportion of students believed the Life History Project
   had increased their understanding of both psychological and social
   aspects of health and illness and the role of the humanistic social
   sciences within this. We discovered that the Life History Project not
   only gave students first-hand experience of the elderly and chronic sick
   but also had a positive effect on their attitudes towards these groups.
   The qualitative free text comments corroborated these views.
   Conclusions: It is possible to positively influence medical students'
   attitudes towards these stigmatised groups; it is therefore important
   that we continue to enhance opportunities for learning about the impact
   of chronic illness on individuals and society throughout the curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Students may become less adept at developing strong patient
   physician relationships during medical school We evaluated whether
   students choosing careers m surgery show a similar negative trend
   METHODS Scores from 2 validated measurements of medical personality were
   compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance The Patient
   Provider Orientation Scale (PPOS) assesses whether students are more
   patient-centered or paternalistic and the Physician Reaction to
   Uncertainty Scale (PRUS) measures willingness to disclose uncertainty
   RESULTS From 1998 to 2005, 236 students completed the PPOS and PRUS in
   the first and third year of medical school Surgical students remained
   patient-centered in their first and third year of medical school (mean
   PPOS, 4 5 vs 4 54 respectively P < 348) In addition, they became more
   willing to disclose uncertainty (mean PRUS improved from 25 5 to 23 8, P
   < 002)

   upon personality traits that are important for developing strong patient

Abstract = {{Selection into GP speciality training is based on results of a
   multi-method job analysis study. Six key competency domains were
   identified as priorities to assess through the current national
   selection process, including empathy, communication, integrity, clinical
   expertise, problem-solving, and resilience. Each applicant is assessed
   using clinical problem-solving and situational judgement machine marked
   tests, followed by high fidelity exercises at regional selection
   centres. These show good internal reliability and predictive validity,
   with high correlations with subsequent job performance and outcomes in
   the MRCGP examinations. Candidate feedback is generally positive, where
   candidates prefer multiple opportunities to demonstrate their aptitude.
   When comparing selection methods, candidates perceive high fidelity
   assessments (for example, a consultation exercise with a simulated
   patient) as the most job relevant and fair. Emerging data provides
   opportunities to both streamline and re-engineer the process, so as to
   optimise efficiency (including cost-effectiveness) while further
   developing its robustness. Logistic considerations favour delivery of
   multiple equated versions of machine marked tests in invigilated test
   centres. As with other assessments in medical education, concerns remain
   about differential performance between UK and international medical
   graduates. There is an urgent need to review the job analysis and
   selection criteria given profound changes in UK general practice taking
   place over the last decade.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To test and refine a model examining relationships among leadership,
   interactional justice, quality of the nursing work environment, safety
   climate and patient and nurse safety outcomes. Background The quality of
   nursing work environments may pose serious threats to patient and nurse
   safety. Justice is an important element in work environments that
   support safety initiatives yet little research has been done that looks
   at how leader interactional justice influences safety outcomes.
   Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 600 acute care
   registered nurses (RNs) to test and refine a model linking interactional
   justice, the quality of nurse leader-nurse relationships, work
   environment and safety climate with patient and nurse outcomes.
   Results In general the hypothesized model was supported. Resonant
   leadership and interactional justice influenced the quality of the
   leader-nurse relationship which in turn affected the quality of the work
   environment and safety climate. This ultimately was associated with
   decreased reported medication errors, intentions to leave and emotional
   exhaustion.
   Conclusions Quality relationships based on fairness and empathy play a
   pivotal role in creating positive safety climates and work environments.
   Implications for Nursing Management To advocate for safe work
   environments, managers must strive to develop high-quality relationships
   through just leadership practices.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study sought to hear what patients approaching death had
   to say about doctor-patient interactions and care in order that doctors
   can learn how to demonstrate care more effectively so that each patient
   feels cared for as an individual.
   Methods: In semi-structured interviews, 13 people dying of cancer shared
   their experiences and perspectives on care within the patient-doctor
   relationship.
   Results: Participants' recollections of experiences with doctors showed
   that genuine demonstration of care begins with doctors seeking common
   ground with the patient as a fellow human being and individual. The
   psychological and physical suffering that results from allowing
   stereotypical assumptions and behaviours to shape doctor-patient
   interaction was clear.
   Conclusion: The consequences of allowing the stereotypes and power of
   the primary context in which patients and doctors interact challenge the
   process of building a caring doctor-patient relationship. Caring doctors
   overcame this by exploring and carefully attending to the individual
   characteristics and needs of patients as people first and foremost.
   Practice implications: To demonstrate genuine care doctors must learn to
   recognise and question the social expectations and inherent assumptions
   of medical contexts and roles of patient and doctor and allow unique
   characteristics of patient and context to guide their interactions. (C)

Title = {{Sexual dysfunction among Ghanaian men presenting with various medical
   conditions}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several medical conditions can affect and disrupt human
   sexuality. The alteration of sexuality in these medical conditions often
   hinder effective communication and empathy between the patients and
   their sexual partners because of cultural attitudes, social norms and
   negative feelings such as anxiety and guilt. Validated and standardized
   sexual inventories might therefore help resolve this problem. The
   objective of this cross-sectional study was to obtain data on the
   prevalence of male sexual dysfunction (SD) among Ghanaians with various
   medical conditions residing in Kumasi.
   Methods: The Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS) was
   administered to 150 Ghanaian men with various medical conditions between
   19 and 66 years old (mean +/- standard deviation: 40.01 +/- 12.32 years)
   domiciled in the Kumasi metropolis.
   Results: Out of the total 150 questionnaires administered, 105 (70.0\%)
   men returned the questionnaires. Questionnaires from 3 men were
   incomplete, leaving 102 complete and evaluable questionnaires,
   indicating a 68.0\% response rate. Of the remaining 102 men, 88.2\% were
   married, 70.6\% had attained higher education, 88.2\% were non-smokers.
   Whereas 54.9\% were engaged in exercise, 61.8\% indulged in alcoholic
   beverages. The prevalence of the various medical conditions include:
   diabetes (18\%), hypertension (24.5\%), migraine (11.8\%), ulcer
   (7.8\%), surgery (6.9\%), STD (3.9) and others (26.5\%). The prevalence
   of SD among the respondents in the study was 59.8\%. The highest
   prevalence of SD was seen among ulcer patients (100\%), followed by
   patients who have undergone surgery (75\%), diabetes (70\%),
   hypertension (50\%), STD (50\%) and the lowest was seen among migraine
   patients (41.7\%).
   Conclusions: SD rate is high among Ghanaian men with medical conditions
   (about 60\%) and vary according to the condition and age.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Medical student burnout is prevalent, and there has been much discussion
   about burnout and professionalism in medical education and the clinical
   learning environment. Yet, few studies have attempted to explore
   relationships between those issues using validated instruments.
   Method
   Medical students were surveyed at the beginning of their fourth year
   using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy-Student Version, and the Professionalism Climate Instrument. The
   data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences,
   and Spearman correlation analysis was performed.
   Results
   Scores indicative of higher medical student burnout were associated with
   lower medical student empathy scores and with lower professionalism
   climate scores observed in medical students, residents, and faculty.
   Conclusions
   Investigators observed relationships between medical student burnout,
   empathy, and professionalism climate. These findings may have
   implications for the design of curriculum interventions to promote
   student well-being and professionalism.}},

Abstract = {{LM Montgomery's The Blue Castle was first published in 1926, yet
   contains many insights into medical practice that remain relevant today.
   The protagonist, Valancy, mistakenly receives a terminal diagnosis in a
   letter from her physician, who has sent her a note intended for another
   patient. Her interactions with the physician raise issues that are still
   relevant in contemporary medical education and practice, primarily the
   importance of effective communication in the physician-patient
   relationship, especially in the context of diagnosing terminal illness
   and handling a diagnostic error. The Blue Castle offers a useful
   starting point for debate and discussion in medical education about
   these topics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To document cases of adverse or near adverse events in
   communication skills training (CST) and to identify risk factors and
   strategies to reduce the likelihood of their occurrence.
   Methods: Six physician CST cases meeting criteria for an adverse or near
   adverse collected from experienced facilitators are analyzed and
   discussed.
   Results: Three types of adverse CST events are described: traumatic
   personal experiences or losses evoked by training; perception that
   feedback is not empathic; and where trainees are referred for remedial
   CST as a risk management strategy.
   Conclusion: Early identification of risk factors and emotional cues of
   trainees is a key first step that facilitates implementation of remedial
   strategies to avert potential adverse events. Consideration of ways that
   physicians' personal experiences impact communication and good feedback
   techniques are vital. The implications of physicians sent to CST for
   risk management purposes is a new scenario that deserves special
   consideration.
   Practice implications: To make CST safer and to optimize learning, early
   recognition of potential adverse events is essential. Specific feedback
   techniques should be mastered by all CST facilitators. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Patient-Doctor Interaction in Rehabilitation: Is There a Relationship
   Between Perceived Interaction Quality and Long Term Treatment Results?}},
Journal = {{REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{315-325}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: A body of evidence suggests that good interaction is crucial
   for high-quality medical practice and that it has a considerable impact
   on treatment outcomes. Less is known about the role and significance of
   doctor-patient interaction in rehabilitation. The study's aim was to
   capture perceived quality of doctor-patient interaction in
   rehabilitation by a rating instrument (PAINT-Questionnaire) and to
   examine the relationship between perceived quality of interaction and
   long-term treatment outcomes.
   Methods: Referring to the approach of Bensing (1990) and Rogers (1972)
   we defined ``quality of interaction{''} in terms of 3 dimensions: (1)
   affective behaviour, i. e., empathy, positive regard and coherence; (2)
   instrumental behaviour: providing and collecting information,
   structuring and reinforcement; (3) participation and involvement of
   patients. 2 parallel versions of the Questionnaire were developed for
   patients and physicians. 7 rehabilitation clinics in north-western
   Germany participated in the multi-centre study. 61 doctors and their 470
   patients evaluated both their shared dialogues upon admission, discharge
   and at least one ward round. Furthermore, patients rated their health
   status on admission (t0), discharge (t1) and 6 months after discharge
   (t2) using the IRES-3 (Indicators of Rehabilitation Status Questionnaire
   Version 3).
   Results: (1) Comparisons of patient and physician evaluations on
   admission revealed the following: Affective quality of contact (empathy
   and coherence) was rated positively and without discrepancies by both
   patients and physicians. On the other hand, instrumental behaviour
   (information and structuring) was rated less positively by patients than
   by physicians. (2) Patients who rated the dialogue on admission more
   positively showed stronger treatment effects with respect to pain, to
   anxiety and depression 6 months after discharge. Also disability days
   decreased about 40\% stronger in the group of positive raters. (3)
   Patient ratings of quality of interaction showed low but significant
   correlations with patient-related aspects like coping with disease,
   health-related knowledge and former positive experiences with
   physicians. A stepwise regression analysis revealed that interaction
   quality seems to contribute to enhanced treatment results independently
   of patients' competences.
   Discussion: Our results suggest a positive relationship between
   perceived interaction quality as defined by the P.A.INT-Questionnaire
   and treatment effects 6 months after discharge. Comparisons of patient
   and physician evaluations showed that physicians seem to be successful
   in building relationships on the affective level but less successful on
   the instrumental level (i. e., information, structuring and
   reinforcement). Our data underline the importance of interaction quality
   for the success of rehabilitation and thus the importance of specific
   skills such as providing and collecting information, recognizing
   patients' concerns and goals as well as reinforcement of health-related
   action. This is especially important when knowledge of disease and
   coping with disease on patients' side is poor. Interaction quality seems
   to contribute to better treatment results independently of patients'
   competences.}},

Abstract = {{Aims of the study: The aim of this study was to investigate the
   relevance and the barriers of physician empathy in medical
   rehabilitation by conducting a narrative literature review and a
   qualitative survey in physicians.
   Methods: First, we described the current state of research of physician
   empathy in medical rehabilitation based on a narrative (non-systematic)
   review of the literature. Additionally, the questions of relevance and
   barriers of physician empathy were examined in a qualitative short
   survey with physicians from Rehabilitation Medicine, Internal Medicine,
   Pediatric and Family Medicine. The qualitative data were analyzed
   according to the summarizing content analysis of Mayring.
   Results: Only n = 13 studies of physician empathy were conducted in
   Rehabilitation Medicine; of those, just a few were from Germany and a
   small number investigated the influence of empathy on patient health
   outcomes. The qualitative survey's results regarding the definition,
   patient outcomes and barriers of physician empathy are similar to other
   theoretical and empirical studies on those issues. Moreover, they show
   many new, practical aspects, particularly in the field of barriers of
   physician empathy.
   Conclusion: Although physician empathy has been shown to be an
   outcome-relevant factor in acute health care, less attention has been
   paid to it in Rehabilitation research. Physicians from Rehabilitation
   Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatric and Family Medicine perceive
   empathic behavior also as an outcome-relevant ability, which is
   particularly hindered by time pressure and stress but also by personal
   and patient-specific factors.}},

Abstract = {{Context The relationship between professionalism and distress among
   medical students is unknown.
   Objective To determine the relationship between measures of
   professionalism and burnout among US medical students.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional survey of all medical
   students attending 7 US medical schools (overall response rate,
   2682/4400 {[}61\%]) in the spring of 2009. The survey included the
   Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the PRIME-MD depression screening
   instrument, and the SF-8 quality of life (QOL) assessment tool, as well
   as items exploring students' personal engagement in unprofessional
   conduct, understanding of appropriate relationships with industry, and
   attitudes regarding physicians' responsibility to society.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of self-reported cheating/dishonest
   behaviors, understanding of appropriate relationships with industry as
   defined by American Medical Association policy, attitudes about
   physicians' responsibility to society, and the relationship of these
   dimensions of professionalism to burnout, symptoms of depression, and
   QOL.
   Results Of the students who responded to all the MBI items, 1354 of 2566
   (52.8\%) had burnout. Cheating/dishonest academic behaviors were rare
   (endorsed by < 10\%) in comparison to unprofessional conduct related to
   patient care (endorsed by up to 43\%). Only 14\% (362/2531) of students
   had opinions on relationships with industry consistent with guidelines
   for 6 scenarios. Students with burnout were more likely to report
   engaging in 1 or more unprofessional behaviors than those without
   burnout (35.0\% vs 21.9\%; odds ratio {[}OR], 1.89; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 1.59-2.24). Students with burnout were also less likely
   to report holding altruistic views regarding physicians' responsibility
   to society. For example, students with burnout were less likely to want
   to provide care for the medically underserved than those without burnout
   (79.3\% vs 85.0\%; OR, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.55-0.83). After multivariable
   analysis adjusting for personal and professional characteristics,
   burnout was the only aspect of distress independently associated with
   reporting 1 or more unprofessional behaviors (OR, 1.76; 95\% CI,
   1.45-2.13) or holding at least 1 less altruistic view regarding
   physicians' responsibility to society (OR, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.35-2.01).
   Conclusion Burnout was associated with self-reported unprofessional
   conduct and less altruistic professional values among medical students
   at 7 US schools. JAMA. 2010;304(11):1173-1180 www.jama.com}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To assess whether perspective-taking, which researchers in other fields
   have shown to induce empathy, improves patient satisfaction in
   encounters between student-clinicians and standardized patients (SPs).
   Method
   In three studies, randomly assigned students (N = 608) received either a
   perspective-taking instruction or a neutral instruction prior to a
   clinical skills examination in 2006-2007. SP satisfaction was the main
   outcome in all three studies. Study 1 involved 245 third-year medical
   students from two universities. Studies 2 and 3 extended Study 1 to
   examine generalizability across student and SP subpopulations. Study 2
   (105 physician assistant students, one university) explored the effect
   of perspective-taking on African American SPs' satisfaction. Study 3
   (258 third-year medical students, two universities) examined the
   intervention's effect on students with high and low baseline
   perspective-taking tendencies.
   Results
   Intervention students outscored controls in patient satisfaction in all
   studies: Study 1: P = .01, standardized effect size = 0.16; Study 2: P =
   .001, standardized effect size = 0.31; Study 3: P = .009, standardized
   effect size = 0.13. In Study 2, perspective-taking improved African
   American SPs' satisfaction. In Study 3, intervention students with high
   baseline perspective-taking tendencies outscored controls (P = .0004,
   standardized effect size = 0.25), whereas those with low
   perspective-taking tendencies did not (P = .72, standardized effect size
   = 0.00).
   Conclusions
   Perspective-taking increased patient satisfaction in all three studies,
   across medical schools, clinical disciplines, and racially diverse
   students and SPs. Perspective-taking as a means for improving patient
   satisfaction deserves further exploration in clinical training and
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, delirium-in
   patients with cancer ranges from 35\% to 50\%. Demoralization, a new
   concept, has not been included in most studies. The role of the
   oncologist in managing depression, anxiety, and demoralization involves
   diagnosing the problem, providing verbal support, first-line
   psychotropic medications, and referral to the psycho-oncology team.
   Empirical studies have shown that oncologists have difficulties in
   recognizing psychological stress and talking with patients about it.
   Reasons include a belief that distress is ``normal{''}; the subject
   matter is embarrassing and uncomfortable; they feel unskilled; and time
   constraints. Therefore, the role of communication training in medical
   school and for oncologists in training is important. Screening for
   psychological distress may identify patients; however, inadequate
   psychosocial follow up and support may make screening counterproductive.
   Depression and anxiety constitute most psychological distress and will
   be described in formal psychiatric terms (Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) and subjective descriptions.
   Demoralization, a concept recently introduced to psycho-oncology, is
   reviewed. Demoralization acts as a bridge from traditional psychiatric
   terminology to newer concepts used to describe the particular
   psychological distress characteristic of advanced cancer. Word concepts,
   such as meaning, spiritual, dignity, and existential, capture the
   patients' distress that is not defined by formal psychiatric taxonomy.
   Management modalities for depression, anxiety, and demoralization are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the association between the empathy-based Faces
   Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the item-based Neonatal Pain, Agitation
   and Sedation Scale (N-PASS) when used to assess prolonged distress in
   term and preterm infants.
   Method: Sequential prospective psychometric evaluations of distress, at
   4-h intervals during a 48-h time period. FPS-R and N-PASS were employed
   in parallel by the nurses in charge in 44 term and preterm newborn
   infants.
   Results: During the overall 48-h observation period, median FPS-R
   declined from 6/10 to 2/10 (p < 0.001) while N-PASS did not change
   significantly. FPS-R and N-PASS showed strong correlation during the
   first 12 h of observation (R(s) = 0.786, p < 0.001). During each of the
   following 12-h observation periods, the strength of this association
   decreased (12-24 h: R(s) = 0.781; 24-36 h: R(s) = 0.675; 36-48 h: R(s) =
   0.658) while remaining significant (p < 0.001). However, when used to
   categorize infants as being in distress or not, the rate of agreement
   between FPS-R and N-PASS showed little variation (0-12 h: 79.6\%, 12-24
   h: 88.6\%; 24-36 h: 89.4\%, 36-48 h: 84.9\%).
   Conclusions: In newborn infants serially assessed over 48 h, there is a
   progressive divergence between FPS-R and N-PASS. There is, however,
   reason to extend the use of the FPS-R also to the neonatal arena, as the
   rate of agreement between N-PASS and FPS-R to categorize an infant as
   being in distress or not remains stable. Preference of item-or
   empathy-based assessment may be a question of personal philosophy rather
   than medical science. (C) 2010 European Federation of International

Abstract = {{Empathy is an important attribute for occupational therapists in
   establishing rapport and in better understanding their clients. However,
   empathy can be compromised by high workloads, personal stressors and
   pressures to demonstrate efficacy. Occupational therapists also work
   with patients from a variety of diagnostic groups. The objective of this
   study was to determine the extent of empathy and attitudes towards
   clients amongst undergraduate occupational therapy students at one
   Australian University. A cross-sectional study was undertaken using a
   written survey of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) and
   the Medical Condition Regard Scale. Overall, a strong level of empathy
   was reported amongst students. Four medical conditions that occupational
   therapists work with (stroke, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury and
   depression) were held in high regard. Substance abuse, however, was held
   in comparatively low regard. Overall, the year of study appeared to have
   no significant impact on the students' empathy. Despite having a lower
   reported empathy level than found in health professions from other
   studies using the JSPE, occupational therapy students were found to have
   a good level of empathy. Of concern, however, was the bias reported
   against the medical condition of substance abuse, highlighting that the
   there may be a need to reinforce that patients from this diagnostic
   group are equally deserving of quality care irrespective of their
   clinical condition. Recommendations for future research include
   completing a longitudinal study of occupational therapy students'
   empathy levels and investigating the empathy levels of occupational
   therapists working with different client groups. Limitations of the
   study include the convenience sampling of occupational therapy students
   enrolled at one university which limits the generalizability of the
   results to groups of participants with similar characteristics.

Title = {{Psychosomatic approach is the new medicine tailored for patient
   personality with a focus on ethics, economy, and quality}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 40 years the proliferation of the biopsychosocial (BPS)
   model across clinical and theoretical research has shown that
   psychosocial factors can be shown to be causes, co-factors, or sequelae
   of many illnesses. Scientific presuppositions about the BPS model have
   been grounded firmly in psychobiological, psycho-behavioural,
   sociobiological, and socio-behavioural processes. According to the
   allostatic load model, stressful factors can be psychological ones or
   any other factor that is able to modify the stress-response system;
   these might include genetic factors or life experiences. Personality
   profiles, in particular, seem to be predictive of responses to different
   stressors. Stress responses - preceding or following illness - are
   clearly related, from a psychobiological point of view, to different
   personality traits, which themselves correlate to specific defence
   mechanisms. Neural processes underlying these mechanisms interact with
   the biological substrate of somatic illnesses. Recent advances in brain
   imaging with regard to neurobiological and behavioural interactions of
   empathy and alexithymia support the crucial role of the (psycho)
   therapeutic relationship across the whole of medical practice.
   Psychotherapies operate as biological factors on mind, brain, and body;
   indeed it is necessary to reconsider the doctor-patient relationship as
   a psychotherapeutic process. The basic methodological triad of
   observation (outer viewing), introspection (inner viewing), and dialogue
   (inter viewing) becomes essential in medical practice and in scientific
   research. Psychoanalytic processes such as transference, resistance, the
   therapeutic alliance, and attachment have been reconsidered from a
   neuroscientific perspective and reconceived as moments of meeting of the
   procedural memory and are therefore considered relevant to the
   relationship with patients in primary care. Indeed, they are useful to
   an ethical approach to understanding the meaning of illness, and they
   also influence the results of treatment projects. Because all these
   aspects impact upon illness duration and quality of life, affecting both
   the individual concerned and his or her family, the economic
   consequences of this psychosomatic approach are important in both
   general and specialist medicine. Medicine is becoming, and will become
   even more in the future, an integrated science; human illness and the
   maintenance of good health may be better understood if all medical
   disciplines are considered as a whole. The domain of psychosomatic
   medicine has now extended to coincide with that of medical practice.
   There is increasing evidence, not only in psychiatry, but in all medical
   fields, that care of the mental well-being of a person is essential for
   effective care of the body. Not only mens sana in corpore sano, but also
   corpus sanus in mente sana.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Multi-rater assessment with gap analysis is a powerful method
   for assessing communication skills and self-insight, and enhancing
   self-reflection. We demonstrate the use of this methodology.
   Methods: The Program for the Approach to Complex Encounters (PACE) is an
   interdisciplinary simulation-based communication skills program.
   Encounters are assessed using an expanded Kalamazoo Consensus Statement
   Essential Elements Checklist adapted for multi-rater feedback and gap
   analysis. Data from a representative conversation were analyzed.
   Results: Likert and forced-choice data with gap analysis are used to
   assess performance. Participants were strong in Demonstrating Empathy
   and Providing Closure, and needed to improve Relationship Building,
   Gathering Information, and understanding the Patient's/Family's
   Perspective. Participants under-appraised their abilities in
   Relationship Building, Providing Closure, and Demonstrating Empathy, as
   well as their overall performance. The conversion of these results into
   verbal feedback is discussed.
   Conclusions: We describe an evaluation methodology using multi-rater
   assessment with gap analysis to assess communication skills and
   self-insight. This methodology enables faculty to identify undervalued
   skills and perceptual blind spots, provide comprehensive, data driven,
   feedback, and encourage reflection. Practice implications:
   Implementation of graphical feedback forms coupled with one-on-one
   discussion using the above methodology has the potential to enhance
   trainee self-awareness and reflection, improving the impact of
   educational programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Formative Experiences of Emerging Physicians: Gauging the Impact of
   Events That Occur During Medical School}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Emotional development, an important component of nascent professional
   competence, is likely to be shaped by specific formative experiences.
   This study sought to identify and gauge the impact of highly evocative
   experiences occurring during medical school.
   Method
   A 34-item list of candidate formative experiences was developed through
   focus group meetings of ``colleges program{''}-affiliated
   student-advising faculty. The resulting survey instrument was
   administered to 216 graduating medical students at the Johns Hopkins
   University School of Medicine in 2007 and 2008 in a cohort study.
   Primary outcomes were exposure rates for the experiences and students'
   ratings of impact for those that occurred.
   Results
   One hundred eighty-one students (84\%) responded. All events were
   experienced by > 25\% of students. Two events were described by most as
   having tremendous impact: ``finding an exceptional role model{''} and
   ``identifying a perfect area of medicine.{''} Other prevalent events
   with strong impact included ``a special patient-care experience,{''} ``
   working well with a team,{''} `` seeing a patient whose life was
   saved,{''} `` encountering a negative role model,{''} `` seeing a
   patient die,{''} `` seeing a patient experience severe pain,{''} and ``
   a bad clinical experience.{''} Factor analysis revealed three event
   clusters: `` inspiring experiences,{''} `` mortality-related
   experiences,{''} and `` negative experiences relating to the learning
   environment.{''}
   Conclusions
   Specific formative experiences have especially strong impacts on medical
   students. Whereas the intrinsic value of such experiences should
   continue to drive educational design, increased awareness of the
   diversity and range of formative experiences will prepare educators to
   more effectively guide positive emotional development, enhancing
   personal and professional growth during medical school.}},

Abstract = {{Advancing age is often associated with co-morbidities. Patients'
   chronological and physiological ages do not always correspond. Elderly
   patients are often excluded from clinical trials and given sub-optimum
   treatment. In this context, the question of equity in access to health
   care arises.
   A specially designed questionnaire was mailed to French oncologists to
   determine what factors influenced them and to elicit their medical
   practice using four clinical cases.
   Significant differences in treatment choice depending only on patient's
   age were observed. The likelihood of an elderly breast cancer patient
   undergoing chemotherapy was found to depend on physician specialty and
   gender, kind of care structure, physician's perception of the age at
   which patients become elderly, and their knowledge about geriatric
   assessments. Some physicians did not always prescribe potentially
   beneficial treatments when dealing with elderly patients. Given the
   multidimensional nature of the care process, patients' preferences
   should be taken into account in medical decision-making. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{To evaluate patients' satisfaction and loyalty to private hospitals and
   to identify factors influencing patient loyalty.
   A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted between May and
   September of 2005.
   Sana'a, the capital city of the Republic of Yemen.
   Eight hundred and nineteen respondents who were admitted for at least 1
   day in a private hospital within last 6 months from the date of
   interview.
   The scores on the modified SERVQUAL market research instrument including
   six domains (tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance,
   empathy and cost) that identify perceptions of service quality. In
   addition, the respondents were asked whether or not they would return to
   the same facility when they need future medical care (loyalty).
   Loyalty was higher among females {[}odds ratio (OR) = 1.44; P < 0.05],
   among those reporting higher reliability scores (OR = 1.24; P < 0.01),
   higher assurance scores (OR = 1.2; P < 0.01) and higher empathy scores
   (OR = 1.13; P < 0.05) and also among those reporting higher cost (OR =
   1.15; P < 0.05). No significant association was found between patient
   loyalty and, tangibility and responsiveness score.
   Improvements are required to achieve high-quality healthcare services in
   the private hospitals in Yemen and increase loyalty among patients.
   Findings from this study could inform private sector healthcare
   development in low- and middle-income countries.}},

   Quality nursing care in the words of nurses.
   Aim.
   This paper is a report of a study of the meaning of quality nursing care
   for practising nurses.
   Background.
   Healthcare quality continues to be a subject of intense criticism and
   debate. Although quality nursing care is vital to patient outcomes and
   safety, meaningful improvements have been disturbingly slow. Analysis of
   quality care literature reveals that practising nurses are rarely
   involved in developing or defining improvement programs for quality
   nursing care. Therefore, two major study premises were that quality
   nursing care must be meaningful and relevant to nurses and that
   uncovering their meaning of quality nursing care could facilitate more
   effective improvement approaches.
   Method.
   Using van Manen's hermeneutic phenomenology, meaning was revealed
   through analysis of interviews to answer the research question `What is
   the lived meaning of quality nursing care for practising nurses?' Twelve
   nurses practising on medical or surgical adult units at general or
   intermediate levels of care within acute care hospitals in the United
   States of America were interviewed. Emerging themes were discovered
   through empirical and reflective analysis of audiotapes and transcripts.
   The data were collected in 2008.
   Findings.
   The revealed lived meaning of quality nursing care for practising nurses
   was meeting human needs through caring, empathetic, respectful
   interactions within which responsibility, intentionality and advocacy
   form an essential, integral foundation.
   Conclusion.
   Nurse managers could develop strategies that support nurses better in
   identifying and delivering quality nursing care reflective of
   responsibility, caring, intentionality, empathy, respect and advocacy.
   Nurse educators could modify education curricula to model and teach
   students the intrinsic qualities identified within these meanings of
   quality nursing care.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES Emotional intelligence (EI) involves the perception,
   processing, regulation and management of emotions. This article aims to
   systematically review the evidence for EI in medicine through the
   context of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   (ACGME) competencies.
   METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic
   Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
   searched for English-language articles published between January 1980
   and March 2009. The grey literature was also searched and experts in the
   field contacted for additional studies. Two independent reviewers
   selected articles which reported empirical research studies about
   clinicians or medical students. Conceptual articles and opinion pieces
   and commentaries were excluded. Information about the measure used to
   assess EI, the study parameter or domain, and the educational or
   clinical outcome (with specific relation to the ACGME competencies) was
   extracted.
   RESULTS The literature search identified 485 citations. An abstract
   review led to the retrieval of 24 articles for full-text assessment, of
   which 16 articles were included in the final review. Eleven studies
   focused on postgraduates, four on undergraduates and one on medical
   school applicants. Six out of seven studies found women to have higher
   EI than men. Higher EI was reported to positively contribute to the
   doctor-patient relationship (three studies), increased empathy (five
   studies), teamwork and communication skills (six studies), and stress
   management, organisational commitment and leadership (three studies).
   CONCLUSIONS Measures of EI correlate with many of the competencies that
   modern medical curricula seek to deliver. Further research is required
   to determine whether training can improve EI and thus augment
   educational and clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The study aim was the development of a method to further
   enhance the educational benefit of medical students' reflective writing.
   The setting is a Doctoring course at the Warren Alpert Medical School of
   Brown University, which includes reflective writing assignments, termed
   ``field notes{''}, combining students' reflective writing with ongoing
   individualized feedback from small group faculty.
   Methods: Three-year (2005-2008) iterative process with three stages of
   immersion, analysis, and revision that resulted in the analysis
   framework. An interdisciplinary team composed of the four authors with
   backgrounds in narrative medicine, qualitative research, psychology, and
   medical education analyzed 12 first and second year students' selected
   field notes in iterative cycles. In each cycle, consultations with small
   group faculty and content experts were conducted to further validate the
   emergent framework.
   Results: This process culminated in the creation of the Brown
   Educational Guide to Analysis of Narrative (BEGAN) framework, a guide
   for crafting feedback to students' reflective writing, and the
   integration of the BEGAN framework into the faculty and student manuals
   for the Doctoring Course in 2008-2009. Conclusions: We propose the BEGAN
   framework as a useful innovative tool that can be incorporated in
   reflective writing curricula in the field of health professions
   education. It is tailored to support the educational impact of the
   course through additional scaffolding of student writing, and the robust
   process it delineates for crafting of faculty feedback.
   Providing systematic feedback to enhance reflective writing may
   represent the path forward in fostering professional development through
   reflection in health professions education. Practice implications: The
   BEGAN can be incorporated in reflective writing curricula in the field
   of health professions education. It is a springboard for the necessary
   next steps of development and research into the acquisition of
   reflective and narrative competence in the emerging professional. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: Burnout has been described as a syndrome of emotional
   exhaustion, depersonalization, and decreased personal accomplishment,
   and may originate during medical school. The objective of this study is
   to determine the prevalence of burnout and contributing factors in
   medical students.
   Methods: A survey was administered to 249 medical students using a
   modified Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and
   scales of stressors, assessment of workload, relaxation, control,
   accomplishment, support systems, and demographics.
   Results: Moderate or high degree of burnout was seen in 21\% of the
   first year class, 41\% of the second year class, 43\% of the third year
   class, and 31\% of the fourth year class (P < 0.05). Lower support,
   higher stress, and lack of control over one's life were significantly
   related to burnout using multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: Burnout progressively develops over the course of medical
   education, while a high level of support and low stress decreased
   burnout.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Medical communication can be a stressful experience for
   both doctors and patients. In particular, inexperienced doctors facing
   the demanding task of a bad news consultation may experience high levels
   of distress. The aim of this exploratory study is to test students'
   differential cardiovascular reactivity to history taking and bad news
   consultations with a simulated patient, and to test the relation between
   the students' self-reported stressfulness of the consultation and their
   cardiovascular response:
   Methods: Fourth and fifth year medical students (n = 20) conducted a
   history taking (HT) and a bad news (BN) consultation in a randomized
   order with a standardized patient. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial
   pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance
   (SVR) were assessed by way of the Finapres-technique in four conditions:
   rest, reading aloud, and during both consultations. Self-reported stress
   was assessed before and after each interview using the State and Trait
   Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a visual analogue scale (VAS).
   Results: Both HT and BN provoked more cardiovascular stress than
   reading. Bad-news provoked the highest HR and CO responses compared to
   all other conditions, and had a greater impact when it was the student's
   first consultation. The STAI and VAS data showed some correlations with
   the cardiovascular stress measures and a comparable but less significant
   pattern in stress response.
   Discussion: The effect of order of the HT and BN consultations on the
   students' stress levels suggests an additional impact of novelty and
   habituation. Unfamiliarity with the patient may enhance the
   stressfulness of the task of breaking bad news. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Reflective capacity has been described as an essential characteristic of
   professionally competent clinical practice, core to ACGME competencies.
   Reflection has been recently linked to promoting effective use of
   feedback in medical education and associated with improved diagnostic
   accuracy, suggesting promising outcomes. There has been a proliferation
   of reflective writing pedagogy within medical education to foster
   development of reflective capacity, extend empathy with deepened
   understanding of patients' experience of illness, and promote
   practitioner well-being. At Alpert Med, ``interactive{''} reflective
   writing with guided individualized feedback from interdisciplinary
   faculty to students' reflective writing has been implemented in a
   Doctoring course and Family Medicine clerkship as an educational method
   to achieve these aims. Such initiatives, however, raise fundamental
   questions of reflection definition, program design, efficacy of methods,
   and outcomes assessment. Within this article, we consider opportunities
   and challenges associated with implementation of reflective writing
   curricula for promotion of reflective capacity within medical education.
   We reflect upon reflection.}},

Title = {{Help, I'm losing patient-centredness! Experiences of medical students

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Despite all educational efforts, the literature shows an ongoing decline
   in patient-centredness during medical education. This study explores the
   experiences of medical students and their teachers and supervisors in
   relation to patient-centredness in order to gain a better understanding
   of the factors that determine its development.
   Methods
   We conducted 11 focus groups on the subject of learning and teaching
   about patient-centredness. We then carried out a constant comparative
   analysis of prior theory and the qualitative data collected in the focus
   groups using the `sensitising concepts' provided by the Attitude-Social
   Influence-Self-Efficacy (ASE) model.
   Results
   Although students express positive attitudes towards patient-centredness
   and acquire patient-centred skills during medical education, this study
   indicates that these are not sufficient to attain the level of competent
   behaviour needed in today's challenging hospital environment. Clinical
   clerkships do provide students with ample opportunity to encounter
   patients and practise patient-centred skills. However, when students
   lack self-efficacy, when they face barriers (time pressure, tiredness)
   or when they are surrounded by non-patient-centred role models and are
   overwhelmed by powerful experiences, they lose their patient-centred
   focus. The study suggests that communication skills training protects
   students from negative social influences. Moreover, personal
   development, including developing the ability to deal with emotions and
   personal suffering, self-awareness and self-care are important qualities
   of the central phenomenon of the `doctor-as-person', which is identified
   as a missing concept in the ASE model. The student-supervisor
   relationship is found to be key to learning patient-centredness and has
   several functions: it facilitates the direct transmission of
   patient-centred skills, knowledge and attitudes; it provides social
   support of students' patient-centred behaviour; it provides support of
   the `student-as-person'; it mirrors patient-centredness by being
   student-centred, and, lastly, it addresses supervisor vulnerability.
   Finally, participants recommend that student-centred education and
   guidance be offered, self-awareness be fostered and more opportunities
   to encounter patients be created, including more time in general
   practice.
   Conclusions
   Supportive student-doctor relationships, student-centred education and
   guidance that addresses the needs of the doctor-as-person are central to
   the development of patient-centredness. Medical education requires
   patient-centred, self-caring and self-aware role models.}},

Abstract = {{Backgound. Reflective writing has been used in undergraduate medical
   curricula to inculcate empathetic attitudes in medical students. Journal
   writing has been used to enhance reflection in a confidential space. We
   aimed to introduce our medical students to reflective writing of their
   daily experiences, both to enhance empathetic attitudes as well as to
   use the entries to inform curricular changes.
   Methods. We invited 16 final year medical students posted in the
   Department of Medicine to record their emotional experiences during a
   6-week posting. Freedom to abstain without prejudice was emphasized, yet
   all 16 students complied.
   Results. According to the principle of grounded theory, the entries were
   grouped into 8 themes: (i) doctor-patient relationship; (ii) personal
   inadequacy; (iii) empathy; (iv) communication skills; (v) doctor's
   competence; (vi) patient behaviour; (vii) hospital practices; and (viii)
   personal feelings. There were 179 entries which were evaluable under the
   above categories, with no significant gender differences. Based on the
   entries, the following curricular suggestions were made: (i) use of
   diaries by medical students to express their emotional reactions and
   make value judgements, followed by guided discussion by experienced
   facilitators; (ii) introduction of communication skills courses at
   appropriate points to enhance interview skills, empathetic listening,
   conflict resolution and breaking bad news; (iii) encourage reflection on
   healthcare delivery and its Inequities and suggest methods of dealing
   with individual patients; and (iv) use of positive feedback and
   encouragement by faculty.
   Conclusions. Reflective journal writing by medical students in India
   gives valuable insights into improving communication skills and
   professionalism. Appropriate curricular changes should be made to meet
   the challenges posed by the existing healthcare system.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Travelling, when searching for knowledge and emotion, can
   cause psychic discomfort that occasionally leads the traveller to seek
   medical attention. The psychiatrist Graziella Magherini described, in
   tourists visiting Florence, acute attacks including disorders of thought
   and affects, and even including, anxiety attack. She named it the
   Stendhal syndrome (SS) remembering the experience of the writer when
   visiting the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence.
   Methods: We attempt to investigate the incidence of SS or isolated
   symptoms related to it, in a homogeneous group of travellers. We review
   other artists who experienced emotion sickness during their trips
   throughout history.
   Results: At the end of the III Neurohistory Meeting (Spanish Neurology
   Society, Italy, February, 2008) a questionnaire was handed out to the
   participant neurologists, in order to evaluate if during the practical
   workshops included in the meeting they had experienced symptoms as those
   described in SS. A total of 48 questionnaires were completed. The mean
   age was 50 9 years and the male/female ratio 1.7/1. Twenty-five percent
   of the subjects considered they had experienced a partial SS. No panic
   attacks or thought disorders were identified, but they did suffer
   artistic effects, mainly in pleasure (83\%) and emotion (62\%).
   Conclusions: No SS case was identified among neurologists attending this
   Neurohistory meeting, but most of them experienced mild disorders of
   affects and one out of four recognized they have had a partial form of
   the syndrome. (C) 2010 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia. Published by

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the impact of nonverbal behaviour on the assessment
   of a clinician's level of empathic communication.
   Methods: One hundred volunteers were asked to assess a clinician's level
   of empathic communication using the Rating Scales for the Assessment of
   Empathic Communication in Medical Interviews (REM). Participants were
   randomly assigned to three groups differing with regard to the level of
   nonverbal information made available to them. Participants either
   watched a simulated medical interview, listened to an audio-only version
   of this interview, or read a transcribed version of the interview.
   Results: Compared to watching a video and listening to an audiotape,
   respectively, reading a transcribed version of the interview produced
   lower empathy ratings and interrater reliabilities.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that assessments of a clinician's
   level of empathic communication may differ according to the level of
   nonverbal information made available to the raters.
   Practice implications: Focusing on the verbal level of communication
   alone ignores the fact that empathy can be expressed through nonverbal
   means. Hence, nonverbal channels need to be taken into account in
   addition to the verbal channel when conducting research on empathic
   communication in health care. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The Schwartz Center Rounds: Evaluation of an Interdisciplinary Approach
   to Enhancing Patient-Centered Communication, Teamwork, and Provider
   Support}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To assess the impact of Schwartz Center Rounds, an interdisciplinary
   forum where attendees discuss psychosocial and emotional aspects of
   patient care. The authors investigated changes in attendees'
   self-reported behaviors and beliefs about patient care, sense of
   teamwork, stress, and personal support.
   Method
   In 2006-2007, researchers conducted retrospective surveys of attendees
   at six sites offering Schwartz Center Rounds ({''}the Rounds{''}) for >=
   3 years and prospective surveys of attendees at 10 new Rounds sites that
   have held >= 7 Rounds.
   Results
   Most of the retrospective survey respondents indicated that attending
   Rounds enhanced their likelihood of attending to psychosocial and
   emotional aspects of care and enhanced their beliefs about the
   importance of empathy. Respondents reported better teamwork, including
   heightened appreciation of the roles and contributions of colleagues.
   There were significant decreases in perceived stress (P < .001) and
   improvements in the ability to cope with the psychosocial demands of
   care (P < .05). In the prospective study, after control for presurvey
   differences, the more Rounds one attended, the greater the impact on
   postsurvey insights into psychosocial aspects of care and teamwork
   (both: P < .05). Respondents to both retrospective and prospective
   surveys described changes in institutional culture and greater focus on
   patient-centered care and institution-specific initiatives.
   Conclusions
   Schwartz Center Rounds may foster enhanced communication, teamwork, and
   provider support. The impact on measured outcomes increased with the
   number of Rounds attended. The Rounds represent an effective strategy
   for providing support to health care professionals and for enhancing
   relationships among them and with their patients.}},

Abstract = {{The current debate on medical professionalism is challenged by
   situations of co-existent ``conventional{''} and
   ``complementary/alternative{''} medical approaches. The issue of this
   article is how to realize professional behaviour in such pluralistic
   context.
   Medical pluralism is presented as consequence of the inherent
   pluralistic feature of science. Both conventional and complementary
   medical approaches need to adhere to the ethical principles and
   commitments of the medical profession. Though questioning scientific
   mainstream models, professional pluralism means to comply with
   scientific attitude. It calls for an unfolding of the premises and
   consequences of the respective therapeutic concepts. Scientific
   orientation of individual therapy includes competence, rational
   assessment of the patient's situation, clinical experience, knowledge of
   external evidence, and a critical evaluation of the course of disease.
   Furthermore, shared decision making on individual therapy requires
   empathy and the consideration of the patient's perspective. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Nettles A and Belton A. An overview of training curricula for diabetes
   peer educators. Family Practice 2010; 27: i33-i39.
   Global community members who experience similar health problems
   gravitate to each other for information and support. Peers may be more
   approachable and can relate to the particular living circumstances one
   experiences. In well-resourced countries, people have opportunities for
   learning diabetes self-management; however, empathy may be more helpful
   when practical barriers arise. Little is published in medical literature
   about how to foster diabetes peer support and what is published is often
   limited to English language. Among those programs available,
   commonalities are readily seen. There is significant evidence that
   well-informed people cope better with adapting their lifestyle to
   medical regimens. Professionally delivered diabetes education has been
   well defined, but there may be additional benefit from learning from
   those who are living the experience everyday regarding how to navigate
   health care systems, handle finances, deal with natural emotions or
   family relations. Diabetes is epidemic and worldwide. There will never
   be sufficient traditional health care services to meet all future
   patients needs. While we persist in training health care professionals
   to deliver better diabetes care, we can explore how to mobilize willing
   volunteers to provide additional ongoing support to people with
   diabetes, where they live and work. While the characteristics of a peer
   educator have been defined slightly differently by several programs,
   there is agreement across programs that they need to be able to
   communicate clearly, they need to be willing to learn, they need to have
   confidence and they need to be flexible and dependable.}},

   The response rate was 43.7\%. As much as 84\% of respondents reported
   satisfaction with training; 69.1\% reported increased workloads; 26.8\%
   reported decreased time with service-users; 40.7\% reported changes in
   relationships with service-users (e.g. increased empathy, but more
   legalistic, conflicted relationships). Almost one in three (27.4\%)
   stated that it was not feasible to implement the Mental Health Act.
   Negative comments highlighted the adversarial nature of mental health
   tribunals, effects on therapeutic relationships and issues related to
   children.
   The implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 has resulted in

Abstract = {{Professional education in dentistry exists to educate good dentists
   dentists equipped and committed to helping society gain the benefits of
   oral health. In achieving this intention, dental educators acknowledge
   that student dentists must acquire the complex knowledge base and the
   sophisticated perceptual-motor skills of dentistry. The graduation of
   knowledgeable and skilled clinicians in dentistry is a necessary, but
   not sufficient, condition for ensuring quality oral health care. The
   further requirement is the commitment of graduates to applying their
   abilities with moral integrity: providing appropriate and quality care
   in their patients' best interest. Ultimately, good dentistry depends on
   individuals committed to treating their patients and society fairly,
   that is, ethically. This essay describes the historical basis for
   thinking about ethics from the perspective of human nature; describes
   how evolutionary ethics seeks to ground moral behavior in human emotion
   rather than primarily human reason; discusses the roots of morality in
   the behavior of animals, behavior that observed in humans would be
   described as empathy; characterizes empathy, discussing its imperative
   in caring for patients; and suggests what implications an
   empathy-mediated understanding of morality has for dental education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Patient surveys consistently show physician communication
   remains less than ideal. While previous studies have demonstrated a lack
   of trainee confidence in delivering bad news, our study explores
   communication skills at all levels of practice and highlights potential
   barriers to improvement.
   Methods: Pediatric residents, fellows, and attendings involved in direct
   patient care at a major academic center participated in a voluntary
   questionnaire, consisting of self-assessed scales of comfort level,
   knowledge level, amount of training, and attitudes towards communication
   education. We also elicited barriers to learning and teaching as well as
   significant experiences.
   Results: Eligible responses (n = 253) were evenly divided between
   trainees and faculty. Almost half of attendings and two thirds of
   fellows did not feel sufficiently knowledgeable to deliver bad news.
   Many attendings felt disproportionately more comfortable than they felt
   knowledgeable. All trainees felt insufficiently knowledgeable for
   independent practice of this skill. Educational barriers centered on
   time constraints, a deemphasis, a lack of positive modeling, and minimal
   awareness of existing resources. Poor experiences revolved around
   inappropriate language and settings as well as insufficient empathy or
   preparedness. Positive anecdotes highlighted the importance of education
   and the impact of role models.
   Conclusion: Independent of level of training, this study reveals a lack
   of self-assessed preparedness from many responsible for delivering bad
   news to patients and families. A significant barrier to improvement is
   the disproportionate level of self-assessed comfort versus knowledge
   level. Educational models should include both didactics to learn the
   skills and practice-based learning to refine the techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Background. A 69 year-old woman presented to an interdisciplinary
   medical group with pathological gambling, and went on to develop
   disinhibition, loss of empathy, and perseverative, stereotyped and
   ritualistic behavior. An initial neuropsychological evaluation showed
   selective impairment on the Iowa Gambling Task similar to that of
   patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, despite normal
   performance on standard neuropsychological tasks. MRI scans showed
   frontal lobe atrophy, which was consistent with findings on
   hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission CT (HMPAO-SPECT).
   Investigations. Physical examination, neuropsychiatric and
   neuropsychological assessments, MRI brain scan, HMPAO-SPECT.
   Diagnosis. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
   Management. Pharmacological treatment with the selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitor paroxetine for impulsive behavior and carbamazepine
   to stabilize mood. The patient and her family also received counseling
   to advise on behavioral and legal issues.}},

Abstract = {{Violence is an important social problem. Violence in the community has
   important social relevance for the political, criminal justice, and
   health care systems. Studies of homicide offenders have suggested a high
   prevalence of neurologic dysfunction due to organic brain damage such as
   traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and dementia have been observed to
   exhibit excessive violence. Moreover, violence in the mentally ill can
   be viewed as an important medical and mental health problem with
   significant implications for forensic psychiatry and the community.
   Although numerous previous studies showed that rate of violent behavior
   in the community is not much higher in patients with serious mental
   disorders (schizophrenia) than in healthy controls, that rate is
   substantially higher in patients with psychiatric comorbidity and
   substance abuse. A high proportion of patients in forensic psychiatric
   facilities are diagnosed with comorbidity, most often with
   schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, organic brain syndrome, various
   personality disorders and comorbid substance abuse. These patients
   represent a high risk group for violence within forensic psychiatric
   facilities, and repetitive violent behavior in the community.
   Understanding the neurobiological basis of aggressive behavior clearly
   has important social and clinical implications. By introduction of
   neuroimaging studies (MU, fMRI, PET, SPECT) as a useful tool in forensic
   psychiatry, the neurobiological aspect of violence is better understood.
   Previous studies have shown that individuals with frontotemporal brain
   dysfunction are frequently displaying antisocial behavior
   (disinhibition, impulsivity, lack of empathy) that justify the diagnosis
   of ``acquired sociopathy/psychopathy{''}. A correlation between the
   potential for impulsive aggression mediated by limbic brain structures,
   and the control of the aggression by frontotemporal brain regions has
   been shown. The individuals with such brain dysfunction have an
   increased risk of violent behavior and scored high on the Webster's and
   Hare's violence risk assessment scale. This article reviews the
   relationship between psychiatric comorbidity, violence risk assessment
   and neuro imaging in forensic psychiatry and showing the useful
   directions for future research, screening and prevention of violent
   behavior among mentally ill criminal offenders.}},

Abstract = {{Feedback is essential to guide students towards expected performance
   goals. The usefulness of teacher feedback on improving communication
   skills (CS) has been well documented. It has been proposed that
   self-assessment and peer-feedback has an equally important role to play
   in enhancing learning. This is the focus of this study. Objectively
   structured self-assessment and peer feedback (OSSP) was incorporated
   into small group CS teaching sessions of a group of semester one medical
   students who were learning CS for the first time, to minimise the
   influence of previous educational interventions. A control group matched
   for academic performance, gender and age was used to enable parallel
   evaluation of the innovation. A reflective log containing closed and
   open ended questions was used for OSSP. Facilitators and simulated
   patients provided feedback to students in both groups during CS learning
   as per routine practice. Student perceptions on OSSP and acceptability
   as a learning method were explored using a questionnaire. CS were
   assessed in both groups using objective structured clinical examination
   (OSCE) as per routine practice and assessors were blinded as to which
   group the student belonged. Mean total score and scores for specific
   areas of interview skills were significantly higher in the experimental
   group. Analysis of the questionnaire data showed that students gained
   fresh insights into specific areas such as empathy, addressing patients'
   concerns and interview style during OSSP which clearly corroborated the
   specific differences in scores. The free text comments were highly
   encouraging as to acceptability of OSSP, in spite of 67\% being never
   exposed to formal self- and peer-assessment during pre-university
   studies. OSSP promotes effective CS learning and learner acceptability
   is high.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In 2000 a diverse group of clinicians/educators at an
   inner-city safety-net hospital identified relational skills to reduce
   disparities at the point of care.
   DESCRIPTION: The resulting interviewing and precepting model helps build
   trust with patients as well as with learners. RESPECT adds attention to
   the relational dimension, addressing documented disparities in respect,
   empathy, power-sharing, and trust while incorporating prior
   cross-cultural models. Specific behavioral descriptions for each
   component make RESPECT a concrete, practical, integrated model for
   teaching patient care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Precepting with RESPECT fosters a safe climate for
   residents to partner with faculty, address challenges with patients at
   risk, and improve outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{To generate empathy in the care of vulnerable older persons requires
   care providers to reflect critically on their care practices. Ethics
   education and training must provide them with tools to accomplish such
   critical reflection. It must also create a pedagogical context in which
   good care can be taught and cultivated. The care-ethics lab `sTimul'
   originated in 2008 in Flanders with the stimulation of ethical
   reflection in care providers and care providers in training as its main
   goal. Also in 2008, sTimul commenced the organization of empathy
   sessions as an attempt to achieve this goal by simulation. The empathy
   session is a practical and fairly straightforward way of working to
   provoke care providers and care providers in training to engage in
   ethical reflection. Characteristic of the empathy session in the
   care-ethics lab is the emphasis on experience as a basis for ethical
   reflection.}},

Title = {{Identifying Barriers to Treatment Adherence and Related Attitudinal
   Patterns in Adolescents With Cystic Fibrosis}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) is directed toward
   correction of organ dysfunction and relief of symptoms resulting from
   the disease. Lack of adherence to daily treatment regimens may have
   substantial short-term and long-term effects on patients with CF. In
   this study, we attempted to identify barriers to treatment adherence
   which could be predicted by objective measures and explore ways to
   improve adherence in adolescents with CF. Methods: A questionnaire was
   given to patients 12.0-20.9 years of age, designed with focus on
   specific barriers to adhering to treatment plan and related attitudinal
   patterns. Observational and analytical results were collected. Results:
   We obtained questionnaires and objective health data for 60 respondents.
   The most commonly identified barriers to adherence were forgetting or
   losing medications (32/60) and being too busy (23/60). Attitudinal
   patterns that played a significant role for nonadherence included
   unintentional forgetting (40/60), feeling that following CF treatments
   resulted in less freedom in their lives (30/60), and believing it is
   acceptable to miss a treatment every few days (18/60) or to miss
   treatments when busy (18/60). Discussion: There were a few statistically
   significant differences of adherence patterns between demographic
   subgroups in our study Males were more likely to agree that it is
   acceptable to miss doses if they are made up with extra doses later
   (24\% vs. 3\%, P=0.04). Patients who perceived themselves to be less
   healthy agreed more to statements of limited freedom, nonsympathetic
   medical providers, and difficulty adhering during times of decreased
   symptoms. This highlights an unexpected risk: as CF progresses and
   patients perceive themselves to be less healthy, they may become less
   likely to be adherent during the periods they are feeling the best,
   while at the same time becoming less likely to perceive empathy from
   their physicians. Conclusions: Survey results describe a variety of
   beliefs and attitudinal patterns which contribute to nonadherence in CF
   treatment, especially relating to time management. While patients
   largely understood the importance of treatments to their health,
   predictors of risky behaviors could lead to targeted interventions by CF
   centers to address these challenges and improve adherence. Pediatr

Title = {{Reports of the Decline of Empathy During Medical Education Are Greatly
   Exaggerated: A Reexamination of the Research}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Research is said to show that empathy declines during medical school and
   residency training. These studies and their results were examined to
   determine the extent of the decline and the plausibility of any
   alternative explanations.
   Method
   Eleven studies published from 2000 to 2008 which reported empathy at
   various stages of physician training were reexamined. Their results were
   transformed back to the original units of the rating scales to make
   results more interpretable by reporting them in the metric of the
   original anchors. Next, the relationship between empathy ratings and
   response rates were examined to see whether response bias was a
   plausible threat to the validity of the empathy decline conclusion.
   Results
   The changes in mean empathy ranged across the 11 studies from a
   0.1-point increase in empathy to a 0.5-point decrease, with an average
   of a 0.2-point decline for the 11 studies (ratings were on 5-point,
   7-point, and 9-point scales). Mean ratings were similar in medical
   school and residency. Response rates were low and-where
   reported-declined on average about 26 percentage points.
   Conclusions
   Reexamination revealed that the evidence does not warrant the strong,
   disturbing conclusion that empathy declines during medical education.
   Results show a very weak decline in mean ratings, and even the weak
   decline is questionable because of the low and varying response rates.
   Moreover, the empathy instruments are self-reports, and it isn't clear
   what they measure-or whether what they measure is indicative of
   patients' perceptions and the effectiveness of patient care. Acad Med.

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: The growing diversity of patient populations
   challenges health care providers. Physicians' attitudes and perceptions
   toward cultural diversity in health care could be partly contributing to
   difficulties in communication between physicians and ethnic minority
   patients. To evaluate these attitudes and perceptions, an instrument was
   developed and validated. Methods: A preliminary version of the
   instrument was developed through literature research and expert
   consultation and completed by 112 family physicians. Factor analysis was
   performed and reliability and construct validity tested. Results: The
   instrument revealed three factors that were interpreted as: (1)
   physicians' task perception and ideas on cultural differences in health
   and health care, (2) physicians' attitudes toward physician-patient
   communication with minority patients, and (3) physicians' perception of
   minority patients' needs in communication. Moderate but significant
   correlations were found between factors of the EMP-3 and practice
   organization, practice location, and physicians' gender. Several factors
   of the Jefferson Empathy Scale, the Patient Practitioner Orientation
   Scale, and the Health Beliefs and Attitude Scale related to the first
   two factors of the EMP-3. Conclusions: This instrument, designed
   specifically to measure physicians' attitudes toward cultural diversity,
   showed moderate validity and reliability results. Further adaptations
   and evaluation could be useful.}},

Abstract = {{While evidence-based medicine (EBM) is often accused on relying on a
   paradigm of `absolute truth', it is in fact highly consistent with Karl
   Popper's criterion of demarcation through falsification. Even more
   relevant, the first three steps of the EBM process are closely patterned
   on Popper's evolutionary approach of objective knowledge: (1)
   recognition of a problem; (2) generation of solutions; and (3) selection
   of the best solution. This places the step 1 of the EBM process
   (building an answerable question) in a pivotal position for the
   understanding of the whole process, and underscores a few aspects which
   are often overlooked in EBM courses. First in this step internal
   evidence (including personal expertise) must be appraised and integrated
   in the problem. Second, issues of applicability of the possible solution
   should be anticipated. Third, and possibly more important, the goal of
   the intervention should be set at this stage (typically by choosing the
   outcome in a PICO question). Depending whether or not goals depend on
   the goals of others, and whether they concern others' voluntary
   behaviour, goals may be classified as self-serving, moral, altruistic or
   moralistic. Thus, delicate ethical questions must be addressed at this
   stage, which means that patient preferences and values must be carefully
   sought, so that empathy, counselling and narrative medicine must be
   mastered to be able to formulate correctly an answerable question. The
   need to modify the current description of the EBM process to increase
   the recognition of implicit assumptions and increase the consistency of
   this model is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To examine how time pressure among nurses influences
   patient-perceived care quality.
   Background Although nurses worldwide face increased time pressure in the
   workplace, no studies have addressed how workplace time pressure
   influences patient-perceived care quality. Patient-perceived care
   quality predicts patient intent to revisit the hospital if care is
   required, warranting investigation as to whether nurse-perceived time
   pressure decreases patient-perceived care quality.
   Methods A cross-sectional design and survey method were adopted. The
   data analysis was based on 229 nurse-patient sets drawn from a medical
   centre in northern Taiwan. Each set comprised one nurse and three
   patients.
   Results The study results demonstrate that time pressure among nurses
   reduces patient-perceived reliability/accountability, responsiveness and
   assurance. The test results, however, did not indicate a significant
   negative association between time pressure and patient-perceived empathy
   and tangibles.
   Conclusion Time pressure among nurses may reduce patient perception of
   care quality in terms of reliability/accountability, responsiveness and
   assurance. Implications for nursing management To enhance patient
   perception of care quality, nursing managers need to devise means to
   reduce nurse-perceived time pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the service quality provided to heart surgery
   patients during their hospital stay, identifying the patient's
   expectations and perceptions. To associate service quality with: gender,
   age and the use of extracorporeal circulation.
   Methods: We studied 82 elective heart surgery patients (52.4\% females
   and 47.6\% males), operated by midsternal thoracotomy, age: 31 to 83
   years (60.4 +/- 13.2 years); period: March to September 2006. Service
   quality was evaluated in two instances: the expectations at
   pre-operative and the perceptions of the service received on the 6(th)
   post-operative; through the application of the modified SERVQUAL scale
   (SERVQUAL-Card). The result was obtained by the difference of the sum of
   the scores on perception minus those of the expectations, and through
   statistical analysis.
   Results: The SERVQUAL-Card scale was statistically validated, showing
   adequate level of internal consistency. We found a higher frequency of
   myocardial revascularization 55 (67.0\%); first heart surgery 72
   (87.8\%) and the use of ECC 69 (84.1\%). We noticed high mean values for
   expectations and perceptions with significant results (P<0.05). We
   observed a significant relationship between the quality of service with:
   gender, in empathy (P = 0.04) and age, in reliability (P = 0.02). There
   was no significant association between ECC and quality of service.
   Conclusion: Service quality was satisfactory. The patient demonstrated a
   high expectation to hospital medical service. Women present a higher
   perception of quality in empathy and younger people in reliability. The
   use of ECC is not related to service quality in this sample. The data
   obtained in this study suggest that the quality of this health service
   can be monitored through the periodical application of the SERVQUAL
   scale.}},

Title = {{Determinants of satisfaction with health care provider interactions at
   health centres in central Ethiopia: a cross sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: In primary health care, provider-patient interaction is
   fundamental platform and critically affects service delivery.
   Nevertheless, it is often ignored in medical research and practice and
   it is infrequently subjected to scientific inquiry, particularly in
   Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess patient satisfaction with health
   care provider interactions and its influencing factors among
   out-patients at health centers in West Shoa, Central Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross sectional facility based study was conducted on 768
   out-patients of six health centers in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia.
   The total sample size was allocated to each of the six health centers
   based on patient flow during the ten days prior to the start of data
   collection. Pre-tested instruments were used for data collection and the
   data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 statistical software. Factor
   score was computed for the items identified to represent the
   satisfaction scale by varimax rotation method. Using this regression
   factor score, multivariate linear regression analysis was performed and
   the effect of independent variables on the regression factor score was
   quantified.
   Results: Seventy three percent of the respondents perceived that
   provider's empathy was good and 35\% complained that providers were not
   technically competent enough. In addition, 82\% of the respondents rated
   non-verbal communication by the providers to be good, very good or
   excellent on a five-point ordinal scale. Regardless of the process, only
   34.1\% of the patients implied that the consultations made a difference
   in understanding their illness and coping with it. Generally speaking,
   62.6\% of the patients reported that they have been satisfied with their
   visit. Perceived empathy, perceived technical competency, non-verbal
   communication, patient enablement, being told the name of once illness,
   type and frequency of visit, knowing the providers and educational
   status were main independent predictors of patient satisfaction in this
   study. Furthermore, very good empathy (Beta = -4.323), fair non-verbal
   communication (Beta = -0.188), fewer expectations met (Beta = -0.169)
   and disagreement to technical competency (Beta = -0.156) had greater
   negative influence on patient satisfaction. On the other hand, excellent
   non-verbal communication (Beta = 0.114) and being told the name of once
   illness (0.109) had pronounced positive influence on patient
   satisfaction.
   Conclusion: The present study showed that interpersonal processes
   including perceived empathy, perceived technical competency, non-verbal
   communication and patient enablement significantly influence patient
   satisfaction. Therefore, health care providers should work towards
   improving the communication skill of their professionals along with
   having technically competent workers which could possibly affect the
   perception of the patient about all of the variables identified as
   independent predictors of patient satisfaction in this study.}},

Title = {{Patient involvement in assessing consultation quality: a quantitative
   study of the Patient Enablement Instrument in Poland}},
Journal = {{HEALTH EXPECTATIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Promoting a more patient-responsive service has been the focus of policy
   initiatives in newer EU states. One measure of success should be the
   patient's assessment of their consultation with their doctor.
   Objectives
   To measure consultation quality in Polish primary care using patient
   enablement (a patient-driven instrument developed in the UK) and to test
   its theoretical framework. To compare the patient enablement outcome of
   different types of doctor delivering primary care in Poland following
   reform.
   Design
   Cross-sectional quantitative questionnaire survey.
   Setting
   Random sample of primary care doctors practising within a 60-km radius
   of Gdansk, Poland.
   Subjects and outcome measures
   Patient Enablement Instrument and correlates were measured in 7924
   consecutive adult consultations of 48 doctors, stratified according to
   training: family medicine specialists (diploma holders), non-diplomates
   and general medicine doctors (polyclinic internists).
   Results
   Completion was high (78\%). The mean patient enablement score in Poland
   was 4.0 (SD 3.3) and mean consultation length was 10.3 min (SD 5.4 min).
   Consultation length and knowing the doctor are independently related to
   patient enablement in the Polish context. Variation between doctors is
   significant, but earlier differences in enablement between alternative
   providers have largely been ameliorated in practice.
   Conclusion
   It is feasible to use patient enablement on a large scale at routine
   consultation in primary care in Poland: acceptability was good in
   diverse environments. The internal consistency of enablement and its
   relationships broadly mirror those found in the UK. The effect of
   patient expectations shaped by social and cultural issues influencing
   enablement outcome requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Studies show that measures of physician and medical students'
   empathy decline with clinical training. Presently, there are limited
   data relating self-reported measures to observed behavior. This study
   explores a self-reported measure and observed empathy in medical
   students.
   METHOD: Students in the Class of 2009, at a university-based medical
   school, were surveyed at the end of their 2nd and 3rd year. Students
   completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version
   (JSPE-S), a self-administered scale, and were evaluated for demonstrated
   empathic behavior during Objective Structured Clinical Examinations
   (OSCEs).
   RESULTS: 97.6\% and 98.1\% of eligible students participated in their
   2nd and 3rd year, respectively. The overall correlation between the
   JSPE-S and OSCE empathy scores was 0.22, p < 0.0001. Students had higher
   self-reported JSPE-S scores in their 2nd year compared to their 3rd year
   (118.63 vs. 116.08, p < 0.0001), but had lower observed empathy scores
   (3.96 vs. 4.15, p < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Empathy measured by a self-administered scale decreased,
   whereas observed empathy increased among medical students with more
   medical training.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Mental problems such as stress, anxiety and depression have been
   described among medical students and are associated with poor academic
   and professional performance. It has been speculated that these problems
   impair students' quality of life (QoL). The authors aimed to assess the
   health-related QoL (HRQL) of medical students throughout their 6 years
   of training at a school with a traditional curriculum.
   Methods
   Of a total of 490 students attending our institution's medical school,
   38 were surveyed in February 2006 (incoming Year 1 group, surveyed when
   students were in the second week of Year 1 classes) and 352 were
   surveyed in February 2007 (students in Years 1-6). Students
   self-reported their HRQL and depressive symptoms using the Short-Form
   Health Survey (SF-36) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
   Comparisons were performed according to year in training, presence of
   depressive symptoms, gender, living arrangements and correlations with
   family income.
   Results
   The students' ages ranged from 18 to 31 years (median 22.3 years).
   Students in Years 2, 3, 4 and 6 had lower scores for mental and physical
   dimensions of HRQL compared with the incoming Year 1 group (P < 0.01),
   with the largest difference observed for Year 3 students. Students with
   depressive symptoms had lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 (P <
   0.01). Female students had lower HRQL scores than males (P < 0.01). No
   differences were observed for students living with versus without family
   and no correlation with family income was found.
   Conclusions
   Major impairments in HRQL were observed among Year 3 students, students
   with depressive symptoms and women. Medical schools should institute
   efforts to ensure that students' HRQL and emotional support are
   maintained, particularly during critical phases of medical training.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the users
   of a private hospital in terms of a number of attributes of the services
   in units. This exploratory, descriptive study used a quantitative
   approach and was developed in a private hospital in the city of Sao
   Paulo. The casuistry consisted of 71 users and data collection was
   performed during the period from March to August 2007, using a
   derivative of the scale model of the Service Quality (SERVQUAL) of the
   evaluative model of Parasuraman et al. The level of overall satisfaction
   ranged around 95\%. The assurance (96\%) and reliability (96\%) were
   considered the most important dimensions of quality, followed by empathy
   (95\%), responsiveness (93\%) and tangibility (88\%). Medical and
   nursing staffs introduced high levels of satisfaction. 91\% has
   intention to recommend the hospital. This research provided the
   knowledge of the attributes most imporant in terms of satisfaction and
   contributed to confirming or reshapping assistance and management
   processes.}},

Title = {{An anatomy of conflicts in primary care encounters: a multi-method study}},
Journal = {{FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{93-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Medical consultations are replete with conflicts,
   particularly in the current era of explicit and implicit rationing
   practices in health care organizations. Although such conflicts may
   challenge the doctor-patient relationship, little is known about them or
   their consequences.
   Aims. To systematically describe the nature of doctor-patient conflicts
   in medical encounters and the strategies physicians use when faced with
   conflicts.
   Methods. Analysis of 291 videotaped routine encounters with 28 general
   practitioners, using a novel adaptation of the Roter interaction
   analysis system software, provided quantitative empirical data on the
   conflicts and on the communication process. Seven focus groups (56 GPs)
   provided qualitative insights and guided the analysis.
   Results. Conflicts were identified in 40\% of consultations; 21\% of
   these were related to the rationing of health care resources. In
   conflictual encounters, both the opening and closing phases of the
   encounter were shorter than in non-conflictual encounters. In coping
   with resource rationing, the commonest strategy was to accept the
   dictates of the system without telling the patients about other options.
   When conflict of this type occurred, doctors showed more opposition to
   the patients rather than empathy.
   Conclusions. Doctors often face conflicts in their routine work, but
   resource-related conflicts are especially difficult and expose the dual
   loyalties of the doctor to the patient and to the system. Insights
   derived from this research can be used to design training interventions
   that improve doctors' efficacy in coping with conflicts and ultimately
   allow them to provide better patient care.}},

Title = {{Development and preliminary psychometric properties of a well-being
   index for medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Psychological distress is common among medical students but
   manifests in a variety of forms. Currently, no brief, practical tool
   exists to simultaneously evaluate these domains of distress among
   medical students. The authors describe the development of a
   subject-reported assessment (Medical Student Well-Being Index, MSWBI)
   intended to screen for medical student distress across a variety of
   domains and examine its preliminary psychometric properties.
   Methods: Relevant domains of distress were identified, items generated,
   and a screening instrument formed using a process of literature review,
   nominal group technique, input from deans and medical students, and
   correlation analysis from previously administered assessments. Eleven
   experts judged the clarity, relevance, and representativeness of the
   items. A Content Validity Index (CVI) was calculated. Interrater
   agreement was assessed using pair-wise percent agreement adjusted for
   chance agreement. Data from 2248 medical students who completed the
   MSWBI along with validated full-length instruments assessing domains of
   interest was used to calculate reliability and explore internal
   structure validity.
   Results: Burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization),
   depression, mental quality of life (QOL), physical QOL, stress, and
   fatigue were domains identified for inclusion in the MSWBI. Six of 7
   items received item CVI-relevance and CVI-representativeness of >= 0.82.
   Overall scale CVI-relevance and CVI-representativeness was 0.94 and
   0.91. Overall pair-wise percent agreement between raters was >= 85\% for
   clarity, relevance, and representativeness. Cronbach's alpha was 0.68.
   Item by item percent pair-wise agreements and Phi were low, suggesting
   little overlap between items. The majority of MSWBI items had a >= 74\%
   sensitivity and specificity for detecting distress within the intended
   domain.
   Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence of reliability
   and content-related validity of the MSWBI. Further research is needed to
   assess remaining psychometric properties and establish scores for which
   intervention is warranted.}},

Title = {{Burnout and Serious Thoughts of Dropping Out of Medical School: A
   Multi-Institutional Study}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-102}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Little is known about students who seriously consider dropping out of
   medical school. The authors assessed the severity of thoughts of
   dropping out and explored the relationship of such thoughts with burnout
   and other indicators of distress.
   Method
   The authors surveyed medical students attending five medical schools in
   2006 and 2007 (prospective cohort) and included two additional medical
   schools in 2007 (cross-sectional cohort). The survey included questions
   about thoughts of dropping out, life events in the previous 12 months,
   and validated instruments evaluating burnout, depression symptoms, and
   quality of life (QOL).
   Results
   Data were provided by 858 (65\%) students in the prospective cohort and
   2,248 (52\%) in the cross-sectional cohort. Of 2,222 respondents, 243
   (11\%) indicated having serious thoughts of dropping out within the last
   year. Burnout (P < .0001), QOL (P < .003 each domain), and depressive
   symptoms (P < .0001) at baseline predicted serious thoughts of dropping
   out during the following year. Each one-point increase in emotional
   exhaustion and depersonalization score and one-point decrease in
   personal accomplishment score at baseline was associated with a 7\%
   increase in the odds of serious thoughts of dropping out during the
   following year. On subsequent confirmatory multivariable analysis, low
   scores for personal accomplishment, lower mental and physical QOL, and
   having children were independent predictors of students having serious
   thoughts of dropping out during the following year.
   Conclusions
   Approximately 11\% of students have serious thoughts of dropping out of
   medical school each year. Burnout seems to be associated with increased
   likelihood of serious thoughts of dropping out.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that student burnout and mental illness are increasing
   in U. S. medical schools. In response, students and administrators
   developed the Vanderbilt Medical Student (VMS) Wellness Program to
   promote student health and well-being through coordination of many new
   and existing resources. This program consists of three core components:
   The Advisory College Program, The Student Wellness Committee, and VMS
   LIVE. Each of the core components includes separate and unique
   individual programs, but each of these three components collaborates
   with the other two to accomplish the broad wellness goal of maximizing
   student health, happiness, and potential. The VMS Wellness Program has
   had early success with substantial growth and outstanding student buy-in
   since its inception in 2005. Preliminary data indicate that nearly every
   student has participated in at least two components of the VMS Wellness
   Program. In addition to participation, student response has been highly
   satisfactory, as evidenced by their positive feedback. The VMS Wellness
   Program is the first published model of a comprehensive medical student
   wellness initiative. The development and design of the program described
   in this article may serve as a framework for other institutions.}},

Abstract = {{The authors recognize the pressing need for teaching methods that
   encourage empathy in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical
   curricula. While the useful application of theatrical acting techniques
   in medical education has been reported in major medical journals, these
   reports present an incomplete picture of these techniques and their
   potential importance to physician competence. The authors propose a
   broader understanding of performance theories and practices and a more
   nuanced appreciation of the experience and knowledge acquired through
   working with standardized patients and acting exercises. The academic
   discipline of performance studies offers a paradigm not only for
   teaching doctors how to ``act{''} in a more truly empathetic and
   compassionate manner but also for analyzing, and thus evaluating and
   improving, human interactions in the medical environment. A complex
   understanding of performance is essential to the development of an
   empathetic imagination, a cognitive faculty that allows physicians to
   generate unique responses to given situations rather than employing
   reactions learned by rote in ``communications training.{''} The authors
   recommend the inclusion of a wide range of performance theories and
   practices alongside the ubiquitous presence, in medical schools and
   other physician education forums, of actors performing as standardized
   patients. Acad Med. 2010; 85: 159-163.}},

Abstract = {{The gross anatomy dissection course is a cost-intensive piece of
   undergraduate medical education that students and professionals alike
   describe as very important within the overall medical curriculum. We
   sought to understand more explicitly students' valuation of gross
   anatomy as an ``important'' course and so developed a quantitative
   longitudinal questionnaire. Medical students (n = 124) enrolled in the
   winter term 2006/2007 gross anatomy course at the Ulm University Faculty
   of Medicine were surveyed anonymously prior to, in the middle of, and at
   the end of the dissection course. Subgroups of students expressing
   rising or falling opinions of course value were identified and
   correlated with student opinions about the course's ability to convey
   professional competencies. Five-point Likert scales were used for each
   survey item, which included such standardized instruments as the NeoFFI,
   BSI, and FBM. The study confirmed that medical students believe
   dissection to be valuable. Students indicated that participation in the
   course facilitated acquisition of anatomy knowledge as well as skills
   related to teamwork, coping with stress, and, to a lesser extent, time
   management. Students also noted that they developed less empathy than
   expected beforehand. Significant subgroup differences were observed
   relative to the competencies of teamwork, stress coping strategies, and
   empathy, as well as in students' stress levels associated with having to
   take a dissection course. Our study builds on previous work that has
   shown dissection courses help students develop professional
   competencies. The increase in professionalism might be a reason for the
   generally high value students place on the gross anatomy dissection
   course, Anat Sci Educ 3:3-11, 2010. (C) 2010 American Association of

Abstract = {{The dissection course (DC) is an essential part of the preclinical
   medical curriculum that mediates professionalism. The process of
   dissecting, however, has an inherent additional stress potential. Our
   study determined student mental stress, their need of psychological
   support and factors influencing this need. A quantitative longitudinal
   query before, during and after the DC was performed including the Brief
   Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as self-formulated questions used a
   5-point Likert scale. Half of the students who anticipated dissection to
   be a stress factor reported that this declined significantly over time.
   Instead, student fear of not being able to cope with the work load
   increased significantly. As many as 64\% of the students favored
   psychological support on the first course day, while 75\% rejected this
   during the period of dissection and 39\% appreciated this after the
   course. Moreover, 42\% emphasized the importance of the funeral
   ceremony. Additionally, 75\% documented their need for support in coping
   with stress and learning strategies. Gender, previous medical training,
   and BSI levels were identified as psychosocial influence factors. A
   majority of students named friends, members of their family or workmates
   as partners with whom they could talk about mental stress. Our results
   document the need to develop an optimum support during the DC taking
   into account the ascertained indicators. Exemplarily the Institute of
   Anatomy and Cell Biology at Ulm University suggests several options like
   a step by step approach for optimization. These measures reduce mental
   stress and help students to cope with it by the development of
   ``detached concern{''} towards their ``first patient{''} as this will
   decisively influence their future professional behavior. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of cancer are an understudied
   population with unique developmental and medical needs that extend well
   beyond their active treatment. Survivors diagnosed as AYAs may
   experience both physical and emotional late effects. In particular, the
   experiences of Latino cancer survivors have not been explored. The
   purpose of this study was to conduct interviews with AYA Latina cancer
   survivors to inform professionals working with these survivors. A
   hermeneutic phenomenological approach was selected based on the focus on
   experiences and meanings of Latino adolescents' cancer survivorship.
   Phenomenology allows for understanding the subjective meaning and lived
   experience of populations that are understudied or marginalized.
   In-depth interviews were conducted with participants. Enrolled in the
   study were Latino AYAs between the ages of 14 and 21 years, after
   treatment. Interviews revealed 7 themes regarding the experience and
   meaning of survivorship for this population: gratitude, humor/positive
   attitude, empathy for younger children with cancer, God and faith,
   cancer happens for a reason/cancer changed my life, familial support,
   and staff relationships. Latino AYA cancer survivors develop meaning out
   of unique cancer experiences. Programs need to be developed specifically
   to address Latina adolescents and young adult survivors of cancer.}},

Title = {{The introduction of medical humanities in the undergraduate curriculum
   of Greek medical schools: challenge and necessity}},
Journal = {{HIPPOKRATIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{241-243}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Medical humanities is a multidisciplinary field,
   consisting of humanities (theory of literature and arts, philosophy,
   ethics, history and theology), social sciences (anthropology, psychology
   and sociology) and arts (literature, theater, cinema, music and visual
   arts), integrated in the undergraduate curriculum of Medical schools.
   The aim of the present study is to discuss medical humanities and
   support the necessity of introduction of a medical humanities course in
   the curriculum of Greek medical schools.
   Materials, Methods and Results: Through the relevant Pub-Med search as
   well as taking into account various curricula of medical schools, it is
   evident that medical education today is characterized by acquisition of
   knowledge and skills and development of medical values and attitudes.
   Clinical observation with the recognition of key data and patterns in
   the collected information, is crucial in the final medical decision,
   i.e. in the complex process, through which doctors accumulate data,
   reach conclusions and decide on therapy. All sciences included in
   medical humanities are important for the high quality education of
   future doctors. The practice of Medicine is in large an image-related
   science. The history of anatomy and art are closely related, already
   from the Renaissance time. Studies have shown that attendance of courses
   on art critics improves the observational skills of medical students.
   Literature is the source of information about the nature and source of
   human emotions and behavior and of narratives of illness, and increases
   imagination. Philosophy aids in the development of analytical and
   synthetical thinking. Teaching of history of medicine develops humility
   and aids in avoiding the repetition of mistakes of the past, and quite
   often raises research and therapeutic skepticism. The comprehension of
   medical ethics and professional deontology guides the patient-doctor
   relationship, as well as the relations between physicians and their
   colleagues. The Medical Humanities course, which is already integrated
   in the undergraduate curriculum of many medical schools of Europe, USA
   and Australia, includes lectures by experts and students' presentations
   on the above-mentioned areas and could be offered, for a semester,
   during the first years.
   Conclusion: The aim of Medical Humanities course is the development of
   imagination and interpretation of data through analytical complex
   procedures, the development of skills of close observation and careful
   interpretation of the patient ``language{''} and the enhancement of
   empathy for the patients, as well as the development of the
   physician-patient relationship and finally the
   conceptualization/construction of personal and professional values.

Title = {{Impact of Resident Well-Being and Empathy on Assessments of Faculty

Abstract = {{Teaching effectiveness is an important criterion for promoting
   clinician-educators. However, the relationship between residents'
   psychological characteristics and their assessments of faculty
   physicians is unknown.
   To determine whether residents' well-being and empathy influenced their
   assessments of faculty physicians.
   We studied 1,191 assessments of 356 faculty physicians by 209 internal
   medicine residents at a large academic medical center from 2007 to 2008.
   A repeated measures design with multivariate generalized estimating
   equations was used to evaluate associations between resident well-being
   and empathy, and residents' assessments of faculty.
   Resident surveys included standardized measures of quality of life,
   burnout, depression, and empathy. Residents assessed faculty members'
   teaching performance with a validated 16-item instrument.
   149 residents (71\%) provided well-being, empathy, and assessment data.
   In multivariate models, faculty assessments from the previous year were
   the strongest predictor of current resident-of-faculty assessment
   scores. Residents' Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) scores
   were also associated with faculty assessments (beta = 0.0063, 95\% CI =
   0.0018-0.0108; p = .0061). On this 140-point, 20-item scale, a 10-point
   increase in empathy correlated with a 0.063-point increase in residents'
   assessments of faculty on a 5-point scale. There were no significant
   associations between residents' assessments of faculty and quality of
   life, burnout, or depression.
   This study demonstrates that residents' well-being does not influence
   their assessments of faculty physicians, thus supporting the
   trustworthiness of these assessments as a criterion for promoting
   clinician-educators. However, the association between residents' empathy
   and resident-of-faculty assessments suggests that faculty assessments
   may be modestly influenced by residents' intrinsic characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{For over a century, Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilych has been one
   of the most influential examinations of how we come to terms with our

   peasant, Gerasim, is able to help him find meaning and resolution before
   death. An excerpt that describes Gerasim's key interaction with Ivan
   Ilych is provided. Analysis of the text reveals how cultural values may
   hinder a patient's ability to confront mortality and how unique social
   barriers inhibit different caretakers' ability to care for a dying

Pages = {{593-600}},
Abstract = {{Physicians' empathy is generally regarded as important and attempts are
   made to foster empathy. However, research indicates that the medical
   students' empathy is often stunted during medical education, and our
   understanding of how empathy is modulated during medical education is
   limited. This critical review explores some relatively-neglected
   challenges in the literature on empathy development in medical
   education. There is a lack of adequate attention to physicians'
   disciplinary matrix, the medico-scientific formation of physicians is
   often neglected, the dichotomy between the science and the humanities
   lives on and the `soft' side is often presented as an appendix. This may
   contribute to sustain a double-blinded, dichotomized clinical gaze - a
   clinical gaze that tends to separate biomedical aspects from human
   experience and understanding and to neglect existential aspects of both
   the physician and the patient. Empathy training and the humanities
   should not be situated outside the hard core of medicine, but rather
   foster critical discussions of the limits and strengths of biomedical
   paradigms throughout medicine. In this way, the gap between biomedicine
   and the humanities could be bridged, and empathy training could
   contribute both in developing physicians' general clinical perception
   and judgement and in preventing the widespread stunting of empathy.}},

Title = {{Stability of values during medical school}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{779-781}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical students' values represent an understudied area of
   research in medical education research. No known studies have
   investigated how medical students' values change over time from
   matriculation to graduation.
   Aim: Values are thought to remain relatively stable over the life
   course. However, little research supports this claim. Therefore, we
   examined the extent to which values change or remain the same during
   medical school.
   Method: Forty-six first-year medical students completed the Physician
   Values in Practice Scale (PVIPS) during their first and fourth years of
   medical school. The PVIPS contains 38 statements of values about medical
   practice and comprises six scales: Prestige, Service, Autonomy,
   Lifestyle, Management, and Scholarly Pursuits.
   Results: Matched pair t-tests (p<0.05) indicated significant differences
   between students' PVIPS scores pretest (first year of medical school)
   and posttest (fourth year of medical school) for 2 of the 6 values
   (Autonomy: t(45) = -4.12, p<0.001 and Lifestyle: t(45) = -2.62, p =
   0.012).
   Conclusions: Medical students values appear to change slightly during
   their 4 years of medical education. In line with literature suggesting
   that the medical education process is associated with change in certain
   student qualities and attributes (e. g., empathy), physician values may
   be another variable so affected.}},

Title = {{Empathy in Iranian medical students: A preliminary psychometric analysis
   and differences by gender and year of medical school}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{E471-E478}},
Abstract = {{Background: It has been well documented that effective empathic
   communication in the context of patient care is associated with improved
   health care outcomes. However, the emphasis given to empathy in medical
   education in Iran is limited, and the state of such teaching is unknown
   in many countries.
   Aims: To determine the psychometric properties of an Iranian translation
   of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) among medical
   students, and to examine the differences on mean empathy scores by
   gender and the different years of medical school.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students.
   Data analysis was based on 181 questionnaires. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation was used to identify the number and
   composition of components constituting the developed constructs.
   Results: The PCA yielded three factors: Compassionate care,
   perspective-taking, and the ability to walk in the patient's shoes. No
   statistically significant differences in the empathy means scores were
   found by gender and the different years of medical school.
   Conclusions: The Persian version of JSPE is a psychometrically sound
   instrument to measure empathy. Cultural backgrounds and pedagogical
   practice may influence medical students' attitudes towards empathy. Some
   recommendations are made, and the study limitations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is one of the fundamental factors in patient care
   that is beneficial to both patient and physician.
   Aims: To assess the psychometric properties of the Persian version of
   the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) in a sample of Iranian
   physicians and examine its correlates. Method: Two hundred and seven
   general physicians completed the JSPE. The associations of empathy
   scores with demographic characteristics and practice-related variables
   were examined.
   Results: The scale showed an acceptable internal consistency
   (alpha=0.78). Three of six extracted factors were considered as
   prominent based on the scree test, which were similar to those obtained
   in the US samples. Women scored higher than men. Empathy improved with
   increasing practice experiences. Other practice-related variables did
   not show a significant association with empathy.
   Conclusions: Results support the construct and criterion-related
   validities and reliability of the Persian version of the JSPE. Score
   difference between Iranian and American samples may not reflect a
   genuine difference in empathy trait and can be explained by cultural
   factors.}},

   cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E42-E48}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) may be related to student
   characteristics (such as conscientiousness and empathy), and performance
   at medical school, although few studies have so far been conducted.
   Aim: To investigate the association of EI with students' age, sex,
   ethnicity and stage of study at a London medical school.
   Methods: All medical students were invited to complete an online EI
   instrument, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
   (MSCEIT) version 2, a 141-item measure of the ability to perceive, use,
   understand and manage emotions. An additional questionnaire to gather
   demographic data was linked to the MSCEIT.
   Results: We analysed 263 responses from a population of 2114 medical
   students after three reminders (12.3\% response rate). Aggregated EI
   scores were similar through the curriculum. Age, sex and ethnicity
   explained 9.2\% of the variance in aggregated EI scores. In terms of
   managing emotions, 6.7\% of the variance was explained by the stage of
   study, with significantly higher scores for students in their final year
   compared to those in the first two years.
   Conclusion: This exploratory study provides preliminary data on EI
   scores for UK medical students identifies factors associated with higher
   and lower scores and suggests that aggregated EI scores remain stable
   during medical training.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: At Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University (Alpert Med), a
   narrative medicine curriculum innovation of students' reflective writing
   (field notes) with individualized feedback from an interdisciplinary
   faculty team (in pre-clinical years) has been implemented in a Doctoring
   course to cultivate reflective capacity, empathy, and humanism.
   Interactive reflective writing (student writer/faculty feedback provider
   dyad), we propose, can additionally support students with rites of
   passage at critical educational junctures.
   Method: At Alpert Med, we have devised a tool to guide faculty in
   crafting quality feedback, i.e. the Brown Educational Guide to Analysis
   of Narrative (BEGAN) which includes identifying students' salient
   quotes, utilizing reflection-inviting questions and close reading,
   highlighting derived lessons/key concepts, extracting clinical patterns,
   and providing concrete recommendations as relevant.
   Results: We provide an example of a student's narrative describing an
   emotionally powerful and meaningful event - the loss of his first
   patient - and faculty responses using BEGAN.
   Conclusion: The provision of quality feedback to students' reflective
   writing - supported by BEGAN - can facilitate the transformation of
   student to professional through reflection within medical education.}},

Title = {{The Patient-Provider Relationship in Chronic Pain Care: Providers'
   Perspectives}},
Journal = {{PAIN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1688-1697}},
Abstract = {{Background. Pain is the most commonly reported symptom in primary care
   and is a leading cause of disability. Primary care providers (PCPs) face
   numerous challenges in caring for patients with chronic pain including
   communication and relational difficulties.
   Objective. The objective of the study was to elicit providers'
   perspectives on their experiences in caring for patients with chronic
   pain.
   Design. The design used was a qualitative study using open-ended,
   in-depth interviews.
   Participants. Twenty providers (10 men, 10 women) from five different
   clinics were interviewed at the Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical
   Center.
   Results. Three broad themes emerged from the analysis: 1) providers
   emphasized the importance of the patient-provider relationship,
   asserting that productive relationships with patients are essential for
   good pain care; 2) providers detailed difficulties they encounter when
   caring for patients with chronic pain, including feeling pressured to
   treat with opioids, believability of patients' reports of pain, worries
   about secondary gain/diversion, and ``abusive{''} or ``difficult{''}
   patients; and 3) providers described the emotional toll they sometimes
   felt with chronic pain care, including feeling frustrated, ungratified,
   and guilty.
   Findings. Findings were interpreted within a model of patient-centered
   care.
   Conclusions. The clinical implications of these findings are two-fold.
   First, PCPs' needs cannot be ignored when considering pain care. PCPs
   need support, both instrumental and emotional, as they care for patients
   with chronic pain. Second, improving PCPs' patient-centered
   communication skills including demonstrating empathy and encouraging
   shared decision-making holds promise for alleviating some of the strain
   and burden reported by providers, ultimately leading to improved patient
   care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the prevalence, causes, and
   consequences of experiencing a major life crisis during medical school.
   Purpose: The objective is to describe the prevalence, causes, and
   consequences through internship of experiencing a major life crisis
   while enrolled as a medical student at Uniformed Services University
   (USU). Method: USU graduates from 1980 to 1999 were surveyed regarding
   their experiences at USU and career milestones. Predictor markers were
   obtained from the USU Admissions, Promotions, and Registrar's office.
   Outcome data were derived from a survey of intern program directors from
   the years 1993 to 1999. Results: There were 1,807 (67\%) of USU
   graduates who responded to our survey. There were 394 (22\%) who
   reported experiencing a major life crisis during medical school.
   Graduates reporting a major life crisis performed slightly poorer in
   terms of basic science GPAs (2.95 vs. 2.85, p .001), USMLE exam scores,
   and performance ratings by their program directors than did graduates
   who did not experience a crisis. Conclusions: A large fraction of
   medical students experience major life crises. The effects of these
   crises may persist throughout internship.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inadequate physician training may be a barrier to
   physician-patient discussions of advance directives (ADs). Description:
   The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an ADs course,
   which includes completing a directive, on medical students' perceived
   knowledge of and preparedness for discussing ADs with patients. All
   4th-year medical students completed a 10-hr bioethics course comprising
   interactive lecture and small-group discussion formats. Curriculum
   content included ethical and legal aspects of ADs. An 8-item survey with
   free-text entry was administered 1 month after course completion.
   Internal consistency reliability of survey scores was determined. Two
   authors independently coded the free-text comments and reached consensus
   on underlying themes. Evaluation: Of the 89 students who completed the
   survey (response rate 80\%), 87 (98\%) felt more knowledgeable and 88
   (99\%) better equipped to counsel patients about ADs. Forty-two (47\%)
   reported they had counseled others to complete ADs during the month
   after the course. Internal consistency reliability of survey scores was
   very good (Cronbach's =.78). Dominant themes of responses to the
   question, oWhat was the most eye opening, troubling, or difficult aspect
   about filling out your advance directive?o included difficulties
   articulating wishes, legal language, selecting a surrogate, and facing
   mortality. Conclusions: These findings suggest an ADs course that
   includes completing a directive enhances medical students' empathy for
   and preparedness to discuss ADs with patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is an essential element of physician
   professionalism. Thus, proper evaluation and education of empathy in
   medical students is important for medical education. Purpose: This study
   was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean
   Student-Version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE-S).
   Methods: The scale was completed cross-sectionally by 493 medical
   students at Seoul National University College of Medicine in Korea.
   Results: Item-total correlations were all positive and statistically
   significant. Cronbach's coefficient alpha was 0.84. A factor structure
   similar to that from American medical students was observed. The mean
   score of 5.2 +/- 0.6 was obtained. Significant differences in the
   empathy scores were observed among years in medical school but not
   between genders. Conclusions: Our findings provide support for the
   reliability and validity of the Korean JSPE-S and indicate that it can
   serve as a useful instrument for assessing empathy among Korean medical
   students.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the meaning of empathy and how it influences
   clinicians in their personal and professional lives. Empathy may benefit
   Client and clinician by improving patient satisfaction and pain
   management, reducing medical errors, and helping to keep clinicians
   grounded in the priorities of patient care. The cultural and
   developmental origins and neural basis of empathy are reviewed to
   provide insight into how a clinician's and client's emotions can
   interact and influence each other. Methods for cultivating and
   communicating empathetic responses in the clinical setting are provided,
   including ways of identifying and dealing with difficult clients.
   Concepts such as attunement, emotional labor, and parallel emotions are
   explained. The limitations to empathy and potential challenges or
   difficulties for the clinician are also explored, along with possible
   solutions. Narratives from the author's personal and professional life
   are included to illustrate how a clinician's emotions can play a
   significant part in interactions with clients. This discussion shows
   that clinicians must combine both evidenced-based practice and empathy
   in their interactions with clients to achieve the professional goal of
   high-quality care.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Since the Winter Term 2008/2009 the Medical School of the
   University of Muenster, Germany, has used standardized patients in the
   clinical course ``Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy{''} with
   fourth-year undergraduate students performing bio-psycho-social
   anamnesis on these standardized patients. We wanted to evaluate the
   influence of the course on students' empathy.
   Methods: A total of 107 students participated in the standardized
   patient program during the Winter Term 2009/2010, with 90 (84.1 \%)
   completing the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy before and after the
   course. In addition, we conducted a standard evaluation of the medical
   faculty.
   Results: The pre-post comparison revealed a significant increase in
   empathy (d = 0.331, p = .001). The standard evaluation yielded a high
   satisfaction among the course participants, though several students did
   assess the course critically.
   Conclusion: The implementation of a standardized patient program in
   psychosomatics and psychotherapy proved to be of value, since it
   increased students' empathy and received a positive evaluation. To
   prevent the students from being humiliated, it is of particular
   importance to implement a gentle and tactful feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lectures supported by theatrical performance may enhance
   learning and be an attractive alternative to traditional lectures. This
   study describes our experience with using theatre in education for
   medical students since 2001.
   Methods: The volunteer students, coached by experienced students, were
   given a two-week preparation period to write and prepare different
   dramatized headache scenarios during three supervised meetings. A
   theatrical performance was followed by a student presentation about
   history taking and clinical findings in diagnosing headache. Finally, a
   group discussion led by students dealt with issues raised in the
   performance. The evaluation of the theatre in education lecture ``A
   Primary Care Approach to Headache{''} was based on feedback from
   students.
   Results: More than 90\% of 43 responding students fully agreed with the
   statement ``Theatrical performance made it easier to understand the
   topic{''}. More than 90\% disagreed with the statements ``Lecture halls
   were not appropriate for this kind of interaction{''} and ``Students as
   teachers were not appropriate{''}. Open-ended questions showed that the
   lesson was thought of as fun, good and useful by most students. The
   headache questions in the final exam showed results that were similar to
   average exam results for other questions.
   Conclusion: Using theatrical performance in medical education was
   appreciated by most students and may facilitate learning and enhance
   empathy and team work communication skills.}},

Title = {{Skills of Internal Medicine Residents in Disclosing Medical Errors: A
   Study Using Standardized Patients}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1803-1808}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To determine internal medicine (IM) residents' ability to disclose a
   medical error using standardized patients (SPs) and to survey residents'
   experiences of disclosure.
   Method
   In 2005, 42 second-year IM residents at the University of Toronto
   participated in the study. Each resident disclosed one medical error
   (insulin overdose) to an SP. The SP and a physician observer scored
   performance using a rating scale (1 = not performed, 2 = performed
   somewhat, and 3 = performed well) that measures error disclosure on five
   specific component skills and that provides an overall assessment score
   (scored on a five-point scale, 5 = high). Residents also completed a
   questionnaire.
   Results
   The mean scores on the five components were explanation of medical facts
   (2.60), honesty (2.31), empathy (2.47), future error prevention (1.99),
   and general communication skills (2.47). The residents' mean overall
   disclosure score was 3.53. Although 27 of 42 residents (64\%) reported
   previous experience in disclosing an error to a patient during their
   training, only 7 (27\%) of these residents reported receiving any
   feedback about their performance. Of 41 residents, 21 (51\%) had
   received some prior training in disclosure, and 38 (93\%) thought
   additional training would be useful and relevant.
   Conclusions
   Disclosing medical error is now a standard practice. Experience with
   medical error begins early in training, and preparing trainees to
   discuss these errors is essential. Areas exist for improvement in
   residents' disclosure abilities, particularly regarding the prevention
   of future errors. Curricula to increase residents' skills and comfort in
   disclosure need to be implemented. Most residents would welcome further
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To date, no study has evaluated the impact of specific
   healthcare provider and parent behaviors on children's distress and
   coping during anesthesia induction.
   Method: Extensive digital video data were collected on 293 two- to
   ten-yr-old children undergoing anesthesia induction with a parent
   present. Anesthesiologist, nurse, and parent behavior and children's
   distress and coping were coded using the Revised Preoperative
   Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale administered using
   specialized coding software.
   Results: Anesthesiologists and parents engaged in higher rates of most
   behaviors than nurses. Overall, adult emotion-focused behavior such as
   empathy and reassurance was significantly positively related to
   children's distress and negatively related to children's coping
   behaviors. Adult distracting behavior such as humor and distracting talk
   showed the opposite pattern. Medical reinterpretation by
   anesthesiologists was significantly positively related to children's
   coping behaviors, but the same behavior by parents was significantly
   positively related to children's distress.
   Conclusions: The data presented here provide evidence for a relation
   between adult behaviors and children's distress and coping at anesthesia
   induction. These behaviors are trainable, and hence it is possible to
   test whether modifying physician behavior can influence child behavior
   in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Skilled physician-family communication in the ICU has been shown to
   improve patient outcomes, but until now little attention has been given
   to the effect of communication on family satisfaction and bereavement
   outcomes. The aim of this review is to outline the recent evidence that
   effective physician communication with families, and proactive
   palliative care interventions can improve outcomes for both patients and
   family, members in the ICU.
   Recent findings
   New data from the ICU correlates physician ability to identify and
   respond to emotion and to effectively share prognostic information with
   improved outcomes. Furthermore, proactive palliative care interventions
   that promote family meetings, use of empathic communication skills, and
   targeted palliative care consultations can improve family satisfaction,
   reduce length of stay in the ICU and reduce adverse family bereavement
   outcomes.
   Summary
   Empathic communication, skilful discussion of prognosis, and effective
   shared decision-making are core elements of quality care in the ICU,
   represent basic competencies for the ICU physician, and should be
   emphasized in future educational and clinical interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Burnout has negative effects on work performance and patient care. The
   current standard for burnout assessment is the Maslach Burnout Inventory
   (MBI), a well-validated instrument consisting of 22 items answered on a
   7-point Likert scale. However, the length of the MBI can limit its
   utility in physician surveys.
   To evaluate the performance of two questions relative to the full MBI
   for measuring burnout.
   Cross-sectional data from 2,248 medical students, 333 internal medicine
   residents, 465 internal medicine faculty, and 7,905 practicing surgeons.
   The single questions with the highest factor loading on the emotional
   exhaustion (EE) ({''}I feel burned out from my work{''}) and
   depersonalization (DP) ({''}I have become more callous toward people
   since I took this job{''}) domains of burnout were evaluated in four
   large samples of medical students, internal medicine residents, internal
   medicine faculty, and practicing surgeons. Spearman correlations between
   the single EE question and the full EE domain score minus that question
   ranged from 0.76-0.83. Spearman correlations between the single DP
   question and the full DP domain score minus that question ranged from
   0.61-0.72. Responses to the single item measures of emotional exhaustion
   and depersonalization stratified risk of high burnout in the relevant
   domain on the full MBI, with consistent patterns across the four sampled
   groups.
   Single item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization
   provide meaningful information on burnout in medical professionals.}},

Title = {{Elements of effective communication-Rediscoveries from homeopathy}},
Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2009}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Patients are increasingly attracted to homeopathy despite the
   unproven effectiveness of homeopathic remedies. Clinical benefit of
   homeopathy may be due to communication. This review aims to identify and
   assess effective communication patterns in homeopathy.
   Methods: Narrative review and synthesis of published communication
   patterns, patient narratives and the author's professional experience as
   a homeopathic practitioner.
   Results: In the biomedical model, where the focus is on disease,
   communication is physician-centered with early redirection of patients'
   concerns, and associated with reduced compliance increasing risk of,
   malpractice claims and low professional fulfillment. The biopsychosocial
   and the developing integrative medicine models are based on biomedicine
   but aim to include the whole person. Patient-centeredness is a behavior
   that elicits, respects and incorporates patients' wishes, allows active
   patient participation and is related to improved outcomes. The
   homeopathic model is based on holism and comprehension of the totality
   of the patient and uses patient-centered communication with a high
   degree of physician cooperation, empathy, hopefulness, enablement and
   narrative competence, all of which can improve outcomes.
   Conclusion: Both biopsychosocial and homeopathic models rely on
   patient-centered communication. Regardless of conceptual differences,
   they overlap in their common respect for the totality and individuality
   of the patient. The study of the homeopathic model shows that respect
   for the whole person is a basic requirement to entrench
   patient-centeredness more firmly in medicine.
   Practice implications: Medical education should include values such as
   individual coping strategies, the benefits of a sound and healthy
   life-style and the necessity of hope and enablement. Health care should
   be redesigned to honor physicians who practice these values. (c) 2009

Abstract = {{People with mental illness around the world continue to suffer from
   stigmatization and limited care. Previous studies utilizing self-report
   questionnaires indicate that many medical students regard clinical work
   with psychiatric patients as unappealing, while the professionalism
   literature has documented a general decline in students' capacity for
   empathy over the course of medical school. Through in-depth interviews,
   this study attempts to better understand the formation of medical
   students' perceptions of psychiatry and the implications of that process
   for a more general understanding of the impact of emotionally-laden
   experiences on medical students' capacity for empathy. Forty-seven
   fourth-year medical students who had expressed interest or performed
   well in psychiatry were asked a series of questions to elicit their
   perceptions of the field of psychiatry. Interview transcripts were
   systematically coded using content analysis and principles of grounded
   theory. Stigma, stereotypes, and stressfully intense emotional reactions
   seemed to adversely affect the students' expected satisfaction from and
   willingness to care for the mentally ill, despite enjoying psychiatry's
   intellectual content and the opportunity to develop in-depth
   relationships with patients. Teaching faculty need to directly address
   the stigma and stereotypes that surround mental illness and actively
   help medical students cope with the stress that they report experiencing
   during their psychiatry clerkship in order to improve the recognition
   and treatment of psychiatric illness by newly graduating physicians.
   More generally, the relationships that we identify among stress,
   stigmatization, and stereotyping along an empathic spectrum suggest that
   increased attention should be paid to the stress that empathy can
   entail. This perspective may allow for the creation of similarly
   targeted interventions throughout the medical school curriculum to
   counteract the decline in empathy, the so-called ``hardening of the
   heart,{''} associated with physician-training worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Context Primary care physicians report high levels of distress, which is
   linked to burnout, attrition, and poorer quality of care. Programs to
   reduce burnout before it results in impairment are rare; data on these
   programs are scarce.
   Objective To determine whether an intensive educational program in
   mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness is associated with
   improvement in primary care physicians' well-being, psychological
   distress, burnout, and capacity for relating to patients.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Before-and-after study of 70 primary
   care physicians in Rochester, New York, in a continuing medical
   education (CME) course in 2007-2008. The course included mindfulness
   meditation, self-awareness exercises, narratives about meaningful
   clinical experiences, appreciative interviews, didactic material, and
   discussion. An 8-week intensive phase (2.5 h/wk, 7-hour retreat) was
   followed by a 10-month maintenance phase (2.5 h/mo).
   Main Outcome Measures Mindfulness (2 subscales), burnout (3 subscales),
   empathy (3 subscales), psychosocial orientation, personality (5
   factors), and mood (6 subscales) measured at baseline and at 2, 12, and
   15 months.
   Results Over the course of the program and follow-up, participants
   demonstrated improvements in mindfulness (raw score, 45.2 to 54.1; raw
   score change {[}Delta], 8.9; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 7.0 to
   10.8); burnout (emotional exhaustion, 26.8 to 20.0; Delta = -6.8; 95\%
   CI, -4.8 to -8.8; depersonalization, 8.4 to 5.9; Delta = -2.5; 95\% CI,
   -1.4 to -3.6; and personal accomplishment, 40.2 to 42.6; Delta = 2.4;
   95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.6); empathy (116.6 to 121.2; Delta = 4.6; 95\% CI, 2.2
   to 7.0); physician belief scale (76.7 to 72.6; Delta = -4.1; 95\% CI,
   -1.8 to -6.4); total mood disturbance (33.2 to 16.1; Delta = -17.1; 95\%
   CI, -11 to -23.2), and personality (conscientiousness, 6.5 to 6.8; Delta
   = 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 5 and emotional stability, 6.1 to 6.6; Delta =
   0.5; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 0.7). Improvements in mindfulness were correlated
   with improvements in total mood disturbance (r = -0.39, P < .001),
   perspective taking subscale of physician empathy (r = 0.31, P < .001),
   burnout (emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment subscales, r =
   -0.32 and 0.33, respectively; P < .001), and personality factors
   (conscientiousness and emotional stability, r = 0.29 and 0.25,
   respectively; P < .001).
   Conclusions Participation in a mindful communication program was
   associated with short-term and sustained improvements in well-being and
   attitudes associated with patient-center care. Because before-and-after
   designs limit inferences about intervention effects, these findings
   warrant randomized trials involving a variety of practicing physicians.

   simultaneously is unknown.
   Objective To determine the association of fatigue and distress with
   self-perceived major medical errors among resident physicians using
   validated metrics.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective longitudinal cohort study
   of categorical and preliminary internal medicine residents at Mayo
   Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Data were provided by 380 of 430 eligible
   residents (88.3\%). Participants began training from 2003 to 2008 and
   completed surveys quarterly through February 2009. Surveys included
   self-assessment of medical errors, linear analog self-assessment of
   overall quality of life (QOL) and fatigue, the Maslach Burnout
   Inventory, the PRIME-MD depression screening instrument, and the Epworth
   Sleepiness Scale.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of self-perceived, self-defined major
   medical errors was recorded. Associations of fatigue, QOL, burnout, and
   symptoms of depression with a subsequently reported major medical error
   were determined using generalized estimating equations for repeated
   measures.
   Results The mean response rate to individual surveys was 67.5\%. Of the
   356 participants providing error data (93.7\%), 139 (39\%) reported
   making at least 1 major medical error during the study period. In
   univariate analyses, there was an association of subsequent
   self-reported error with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.10 per unit increase; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.03-1.16; P = .002) and fatigue score (OR, 1.14 per unit increase; 95\%
   CI, 1.08-1.21; P < .001). Subsequent error was also associated with
   burnout (ORs per 1-unit change: depersonalization OR, 1.09; 95\% CI,
   1.05-1.12; P < .001; emotional exhaustion OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.08;
   P < .001; lower personal accomplishment OR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.92-0.97; P
   < .001), a positive depression screen (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.76-3.72; P <
   .001), and overall QOL (OR, 0.84 per unit increase; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.91;
   P < .001). Fatigue and distress variables remained statistically
   significant when modeled together with little change in the point
   estimates of effect. Sleepiness and distress, when modeled together,
   showed little change in point estimates of effect, but sleepiness no
   longer had a statistically significant association with errors when
   adjusted for burnout or depression.
   Conclusion Among internal medicine residents, higher levels of fatigue
   and distress are independently associated with self-perceived medical
   errors. JAMA. 2009;302(12):1294-1300}},

Abstract = {{Preserving and promoting empathy are ethical imperatives in medical
   education. The authors of this commentary propose that the ``hidden
   curriculum{''} and mixed messages learners frequently receive during
   clinical rotations may erode humanistic traits essential to high-quality
   care. Three articles in this issue focus on assessing attitude towards
   empathy in the health care setting using the Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy. The authors discuss salient points from these
   reports, reinforce the concept of empathy as a cognitive attribute, and
   offer recommendations for teaching and nurturing empathy in health
   professionals. In the reports, construct validity and reliability of the
   instrument were confirmed and were comparable with previous results,
   thus providing medical educators with a sound instrument to measure
   empathic attitudes in the context of patient care. The authors agree
   with the distinctions made in the three studies between empathy
   (described as a cognitive attribute) and sympathy (described as an
   emotional attribute) and believe that empathy as a cognitive skill can
   be role modeled, taught, and assessed. Barriers to empathic practice
   (lack of sufficient role models, failing to teach empathy as a cognitive
   skill, negative experiences, time pressures, overreliance on technology)
   can be remedied in medical education through interprofessional education
   and practice and institutional promotion of relationship-centered care,
   which maintains the centrality of the patient-clinician relationship
   while recognizing the importance of relationships with self and others.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the articles in this issue about measuring physician
   empathy by Hojat and colleagues, Di Lillo and colleagues, and Kataoka
   and colleagues, this commentary further explores the concept of empathy.
   It is posited that empathy is an emotion important to medical care, but
   it is emphasized that it really doesn't matter whether empathy is a
   thought or an emotion. Retaining or enhancing it in medical care givers
   is worth doing and may be achieved through (1) the selection of medical
   students and others who will care for the sick, (2) the training
   caretakers receive, and more fundamentally even, (3) reconsideration of
   what doctors do in a world so much changed and so diverse.
   Empathy is the foundation of patient care, and it should frame the
   skills of the profession. It may be that empathy can be taught by
   example, but the minds of students, like soil, must be prepared before
   they can nourish seeds of knowledge, and in some soils little grows.
   Physicians must have the time to listen to their patients. Listening can
   create empathy-if physicians remain open to be moved by the stories they
   hear. Empathy has always been and will always be among a physician's
   most essential tools of practice.}},

Title = {{The Devil is in the Third Year: A Longitudinal Study of Erosion of
   Empathy in Medical School}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1182-1191}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This longitudinal study was designed to examine changes in medical
   students' empathy during medical school and to determine when the most
   significant changes occur.
   Method
   Four hundred fifty-six students who entered Jefferson Medical College in
   2002 (n = 227) and 2004 (n = 229) completed the Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy at five different times: at entry into medical school
   on orientation day and subsequently at the end of each academic year.
   Statistical analyses were performed for the entire cohort, as well as
   for the ``matched{''} cohort (participants who identified themselves at
   all five test administrations) and the ``unmatched{''} cohort
   (participants who did not identify themselves in all five test
   administrations).
   Results
   Statistical analyses showed that empathy scores did not change
   significantly during the first two years of medical school. However, a
   significant decline in empathy scores was observed at the end of the
   third year which persisted until graduation. Findings were similar for
   the matched cohort (n = 121) and for the rest of the sample (unmatched
   cohort, n = 335). Patterns of decline in empathy scores were similar for
   men and women and across specialties.
   Conclusions
   It is concluded that a significant decline in empathy occurs during the
   third year of medical school. It is ironic that the erosion of empathy
   occurs during a time when the curriculum is shifting toward patient-care
   activities; this is when empathy is most essential. Implications for
   retaining and enhancing empathy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine psychometric properties of a Japanese translation of the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), and to study differences in
   empathy scores between men and women, and students in different years of
   medical school.
   Method
   The student version of the JSPE was translated into Japanese using
   back-translation procedures and administered to 400 Japanese students
   from all six years at the Okayama University Medical School. Item-total
   score correlations were calculated. Factor analysis was used to examine
   the underlying components of the Japanese version of the JSPE. Cronbach
   coefficient alpha was calculated to assess the internal consistency
   aspect of reliability of the instrument. Finally, empathy scores for men
   and women were compared using t test, and score differences by year of
   medical school were examined using analysis of variance.
   Results
   Factor analysis confirmed the three components of ``perspective
   taking,{''} ``compassionate care,{''} and ``ability to stand in
   patient's shoes,{''} which had emerged in American and Mexican medical
   students. Item-total score correlations were all positive and
   statistically significant. Cronbach coefficient alpha was .80. Women
   outscored men, and empathy scores increased as students progressed
   through medical school in this cross-sectional study.
   Conclusions
   Findings provide support for the construct validity and reliability of
   the Japanese translated version of the JSPE for medical students.
   Cultural characteristics and educational differences in Japanese medical
   schools that influence empathic behaviors are described, and
   implications for cross-cultural study of empathy are discussed.}},

Title = {{The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy: Preliminary Psychometrics and
   Group Comparisons in Italian Physicians}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1198-1202}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine the psychometrics of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE) among a sample of Italian physicians.
   Method
   The JSPE was translated into Italian using back-translation procedures
   to ensure the accuracy of the translation. The translated JSPE was
   administered to 778 physicians at three hospitals in Rome, Italy in
   2002. Individual empathy scores were calculated, as well as descriptive
   statistics at the item and scale level. Group comparisons of empathy
   scores were also made among men and women, physicians practicing in
   medical or surgical specialties, physicians working in different
   hospitals, and at physicians at various levels of career rank.
   Results
   Results are reported for 289 participants who completed the JSPE.
   Item-total score correlations were all positive and statistically
   significant. The prominent component of ``perspective taking,{''} which
   is the most important underlying construct of the scale, emerged in the
   factor analysis of the JSPE and was similar in both Italian and American
   samples. However, more factors appeared among Italian physicians,
   indicating that the underlying construct of empathy may be more complex
   among Italians. Cronbach coefficient alpha was .85. None of the group
   differences observed among physicians classified by gender, hospital of
   practice, specialty, or level of career rank reached statistical
   significance.
   Conclusions
   Findings generally provide support for the construct validity and
   reliability of the Italian version of the JSPE. Further research is
   needed to determine whether the lack of statistically significant
   differences in empathy by gender and specialty is related to cultural
   peculiarities, the translation of the scale, or sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the association of parent behavior with infant
   distress during a potentially painful medical procedure. A second aim
   was to investigate the association of parent chronic pain and
   psychological problems with parent behavior and infant distress during
   the procedure. Design: Population-based cohort study with both
   cross-sectional and prospective measurements. Main Outcome Measures:
   Video recordings of 275 parents and their 14-month-old infant undergoing
   venipuncture were coded with an observational instrument to yield
   measures of infant distress behaviors and parent behaviors, such as
   reassuring, showing empathy, praising, and distracting. Parent chronic
   pain and psychological problems were assessed through questionnaires.
   Results: Infants cried 58\% of procedure duration. Parent reassuring
   occurred 34\% of procedure duration, and parent distracting occurred
   37\% of procedure duration. Infant distress was positively related to
   parent reassuring and negatively related to parent praising. Parent
   chronic pain was related to increased parent distracting but not to
   parent reassuring. Parent psychological problems were not associated
   with parent behavior and infant distress. Conclusion: Parent behavior
   rather than psychological traits is related to increased venipuncture
   distress in young infants. This finding suggests that the focus should
   be on interventions based on behavior modification.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There is a growing amount of empirical research on empathy in
   medicine. This critical review assesses methodological limitations in
   this body of research that have not received adequate attention.
   Methods: Scientific publications presenting empirical research on
   medical students' or physicians' empathy were systematically searched
   for.
   Results: 206 publications were identified and critically reviewed.
   Multiple empirical approaches have been used. However, there are some
   remarkable tendencies given the complexity of the study object: empathy
   is often not defined. Qualitative approaches are rarely used and the
   predominant quantitative instruments have a relatively narrow or
   peripheral scope. For example, the concrete experiences, feelings, and
   interpretations of the physician and the patient, and empathy in
   clinical practice, are often neglected. Furthermore, possible influences
   of medical training and working conditions on empathy have not been
   adequately explored.
   Conclusion: The empirical studies of empathy in medicine tend to
   separate empathy from main parts of clinical perception, judgment, and
   communication. Thus, important aspects and influences of empathy have
   been relatively neglected.
   Practice implications: Future studies should include transparent
   concepts, more than one method and perspective, qualitative approaches,
   the physician's and the patient's concrete experiences and
   interpretations, and the context in which empathy is developed and
   practiced. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure rapport between medical students and standardized
   patients using observer ratings; to relate these ratings to students'
   emotional awareness and to behavior within the medical interaction; and
   to assess the relative validity of using excerpts of different lengths
   for the measurement of rapport.
   Methods: Third-year medical students (N = 141) were videotaped during a
   15-min interaction with a standardized patient, and rapport as well as
   other communication variables were measured using trained coders.
   Rapport was measured with good interrater reliability by trained coders
   who viewed three 1-min excerpts. Emotional awareness was measured by a
   test of recognizing facial expressions of emotion, self-ratings of
   emotional self-awareness, and peer ratings of interpersonal sensitivity.
   Finally, participants who viewed the videotapes while imagining
   themselves to be the patient (analogue patients) provided impressions of
   the students, including satisfaction.
   Results: Rapport based on all three minutes was positively correlated
   with accuracy in decoding facial expressions of emotion, self-reported
   attention to one's own emotions, peer ratings of sensitivity,
   communication behaviors of the medical student and standardized patient,
   and analogue patients' positive impressions and satisfaction. Rapport
   based on just the first minute of the interaction was significantly
   related to many of these variables.
   Conclusion: Rating short excerpts of behavior is a valid and efficient
   methodology for capturing the concept of rapport.
   Practice implications: Clinicians, researchers, and educators should
   focus on rapport building, even very early in the medical visit. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: A body of evidence suggests that good interaction is crucial
   for high-quality medical practice and has a considerable impact on
   treatment outcomes. Less is known about the role and significance of
   doctor-patient interaction in rehabilitation. The study aim was to
   capture perceived quality of doctor-patient interaction in
   rehabilitation by a rating instrument (P.A.INT-Questionnaire. P.A.INT is
   the abbreviation for Patient-Arzt-Interaktion (German)) and to examine
   the relationship between perceived quality of interaction and long-term
   treatment outcomes.
   Methods: Referring to the approach of Bensing {[}Bensing JM. Doctor
   patient communication and the quality of care. Utrecht: NIVEL; 1990] we
   defined ``quality of interaction{''} in terms of three dimensions: (1)
   affective behaviour, i.e. empathy, positive regard and coherence
   {[}Rogers CR. Die nicht direktive Beratung Munchen: Kindler
   Studienausgabe {[}Counselling and psychotherapy, 1942]. Boston; 1972];
   (2) instrumental behaviour: providing and collecting information.
   structuring and reinforcement; (3) participation and involvement of
   patients. Two parallel versions of the questionnaire were developed for
   patients and physicians. Seven rehabilitation clinics in north western
   Germany participated in the multicentre study. Sixty-one doctors and
   their four hundred and seventy patients evaluated both their shared
   dialogues upon admission, discharge and ward round. Furthermore,
   patients rated their health status on admission (t0), discharge (t1) and
   six months after discharge (t2) with the IRES-3 (Indicators of
   Rehabilitation Status Questionnaire, Version 3).
   Results: (1) Comparisons of patient and physician evaluations on
   admission revealed the following: affective quality of contact (empathy
   and coherence) was rated positively and without discrepancies by both
   patients and physicians. On the other hand, instrumental behaviour
   (information and structuring) was rated less positively by patients than
   by physicians. (2) Patients who rated the dialogue on admission more
   positively showed stronger treatment effects with respect to pain as
   well as to anxiety at discharge and six months after discharge. Analysis
   for single scales of the P.A.INT-Questionnaire revealed that this is due
   to affective and instrumental quality of the dialogues.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest a correlation between perceived
   interaction quality, as defined by our questionnaire and treatment
   effects six months after discharge. Comparisons of patient and physician
   evaluations showed that physicians seem to be successful in building
   relationships on the affective level, but less successful on the
   instrumental level (i.e. information, structuring and reinforcement).
   They also perceive disturbances on the relational and organisational
   level more strongly than patients.
   Practice implications: Our data underline the importance of interaction
   quality for the success of rehabilitation and thus the importance of
   specific skills such as providing and collecting information,
   recognizing patients' concerns and goals as well as reinforcement of
   health related action. Regular training and supervision should be
   provided to support physicians and to enhance their competence in
   dealing with patients concerns. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Suffering is the experience of distress or disharmony caused by the
   loss, or threatened loss, of what we most cherish. Such losses may strip
   away the beliefs by which we construct a meaningful narrative of human
   life in general and our own in particular. The vocation of physicians
   and other health professionals is to relieve suffering caused by
   illness, trauma,and bodily degeneration. However, since suffering is an
   existential state that does not necessarily parallel physical or
   emotional states, physicians cannot rely solely on knowledge and skills
   that address physiological dysfunction. Rather, they must learn to
   engage the patient at an existential level. Unfortunately, however,
   medical pedagogy encourages ``detached concern:{''} which devalues
   subjectivity, emotion, relationship, and solidarity The term
   ``compassionate solidarity{''} summarizes an alternative model, which
   begins with empathic listening and responding, requires reflectivity and
   self-understanding, and is in itself a healing act. Poetry, along with
   other imaginative writing, may help physicians and other health
   professionals grow in self-awareness and gain deeper understanding of
   suffering, empathy, compassion, and symbolic healing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report the proportion of Canadian medical students
   interested in a career in psychiatry at medical school entry and to
   describe the unique demographics and career influences associated With
   this early interest.
   Methods: From 2001 to 2004, during the first 2 weeks of medical school,
   a 41-item survey of career choice, demographics, and attitudes toward
   various aspects of medical practice was distributed to all students in
   18 classes at 8 Canadian medical schools. Associations between early
   career interest, demographics, and career influences were explored.
   Results: Of the 2096 completed surveys, 3.2\% of students named
   psychiatry as their first career choice. While 34\% of students
   considered psychiatry a possible career option, 54.9\% stated that they
   had not considered this option. Students interested in psychiatry were
   more likely than other students to have an undergraduate education in
   the arts, to have close family or friends practicing medicine, and to
   have worked voluntarily with people with mental illness. Students
   interested in psychiatry had a lesser social orientation than students
   interested in family medicine but had a greater social orientation and
   lesser hospital orientation than students interested in other
   specialties.
   Conclusions: Enhanced psychiatric care may be aided by the selective
   recruitment into medical school of students with a demonstrated empathy
   toward people with mental illness, an educational background in the
   arts, and a strong social orientation. As career influences change
   throughout medical school, participants in this study will be
   re-surveyed at graduation to better understand the evolution of career
   choice decision-making throughout medical school. Can J Psychiatry.

Title = {{Measuring patient's expectation and the perception of quality in LASIK
   services}},
Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: LASIK is the use of excimer lasers to treat therapeutic and
   refractive visual disorders, ranging from superficial scars to
   nearsightedness (myopia), and from astigmatism to farsightedness
   (hyperopia). The purposes of this study are to checking the
   applicability and psychometric properties of the SERVQUAL on Lasik
   surgery population. Second, use SEM methods to investigate the loyalty,
   perceptions and expectations relationship on LASIK surgery.
   Methods: The method with which this study was conducted was
   questionnaire development. A total of 463 consecutive patients,
   attending LASIK surgery affiliated with Chung Shan Medical University
   Eye Center, enrolled in this study. All participants were asked to
   complete revised SERVQUAL questionnaires. Student t test, correlation
   test, and ANOVA and factor analyses were used to identify the characters
   and factors of service quality. Paired t test were used to test the gap
   between expectation and perception scores and structural equation
   modeling was used to examine relationships among satisfaction
   components.
   Results: The effective response rate was 97.3\%. Validity was verified
   by several methods and internal reliability Cronbach's alpha was >0.958.
   The results from patient's scores were very high with an overall score
   of 6.41(0.66), expectations at 6.68(0.47), and perceptions at
   6.51(0.57). The gap between expectations and perceptions was
   significant, however, (t = 6.08). Furthermore, there were significant
   differences in the expectation scores among the different jobs. Also,
   the results showed that the higher the education of the patient, the
   lower their perception score (r = -0.10). The factor loading results of
   factor analysis showed 5 factors of the 22 items of the SERVQUAL model.
   The 5 factors of perception explained 72.94\% of the total variance
   there; and on expectations it explained 77.12\% of the total variance of
   satisfaction scores. The goodness-of-fit summary, of structure equation
   modeling, showed trends in concept on expectations, perceptions, and
   loyalty.
   Conclusion: The results of this research appear to show that the
   SERVQUAL instrument is a useful measurement tool in assessing and
   monitoring service quality in LASIK service, and enabling staff to
   identify where improvements are needed, from the patients' perspective.
   There were service quality gaps in the reliability, assurance, and
   empathy. This study suggested that physicians should increase their
   discussions with patients; which has, of course, already been proven to
   be an effective way to increase patient's satisfaction with medical
   care, regardless of the procedure received.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE while historic medical oaths and numerous contemporary medical
   organizations offer guidelines for professionalism, the nature of the
   professional aspirations, commitments, and values of current medical
   students is not well known. We sought to provide a thematic catalogue of
   individual mission statements written by medical students nationally.
   METHODS In the Healer's Art elective course, students write a personal
   mission statement about their highest professional values. In 2006-2007,
   we randomly selected 100 student mission statements from 10
   representative schools nationally. Three researchers coded content using
   a team-based qualitative approach and categorized the codes into major
   themes. Student mission statements were compared with classic medical
   oaths and contemporary professionalism guidelines.
   RESULTS The mission statements were similar across different schools,
   Three major themes emerged, comprised of codes identified in 20\% or
   more of the mission statements. The first theme, professional skills,
   includes dealing with the negatives of training, listening and empathy,
   growth and development. The second theme, personal qualities, includes
   wholeness, humility, and constancy/perfectionism. The third theme, scope
   of professional practice, includes physician relationships, positive
   emotions, healing, service, spirituality, and balance. Unlike the
   content of classic oaths and contemporary professionalism statements,
   the students' statements dealt with fears, personal-professional
   balance, love, non-hierachical relationships, self-care, healing, and
   awe as key to being a physician.
   CONCLUSIONS In their personal mission statements, this national cohort
   of medical students described an expanded view of physicianhood that
   includes such elements as presence, love, and awe. Medical school
   curricula may require adaptation to support the personal aspirations of
   those now entering the profession.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study's objective was to assess the relationship of
   empathy in medical office visits to subsequent outcomes,of the common
   cold. Methods: A total of 350 subjects >= 12 years of age received
   either a standard or enhanced physician visit as part of a randomized
   controlled trial. Enhanced visits emphasized empathy on the part of the
   physician. The patient-scored Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
   questionnaire assessed practitioner-patient interaction, especially
   empathy. Cold severity and duration were assessed from twice-daily
   symptom reports. Nasal wash was performed to measure the immune cytokine
   interleukin-8 (IL-8). Results: Eighty-four individuals reported perfect
   (score of 50) CARE scores. They tended to be older with less education
   but reported similar health status, quality of life, and levels of
   optimism. In those with perfect CARE scores, cold duration was shorter
   (mean 7.10 days versus 8.01 days), and there was a trend toward reduced
   severity (mean area under receiver-operator characteristics curve 240.40
   versus 284.49). After accounting for possible confounding variables,
   cold severity and duration were significantly lower in those reporting
   perfect CARE scores. In these models, a perfect score also correlated
   with a larger increase in IL-8 levels. Conclusions: Clinician empathy,
   as perceived by patients with the common cold, significantly predicts
   subsequent duration and severity of illness and is associated with
   immune system changes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The importance of respecting patients and participants in
   clinical research is widely recognised. However, what it means to
   respect persons beyond recognising them as autonomous is unclear, and
   little is known about what patients find to be respectful.
   Objective: To understand patients' conceptions of respect and what it
   means to be respected by medical providers.
   Design: Qualitative study from an academic cardiology clinic, using
   semistructured interviews with 18 survivors of sudden cardiac death.
   Results: Patients believed that respecting persons incorporates the
   following major elements: empathy, care, autonomy, provision of
   information, recognition of individuality, dignity and attention to
   needs.
   Conclusions: Making patients feel respected, or valued as a person, is a
   multi-faceted task that involves more than recognising autonomy. While
   patients' views of respect do not determine what respect means, these
   patients expressed important intuitions that may be of substantial
   conceptual relevance.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of the humanities ill medical education may offer
   significant potential benefits to individual future physicians and to
   the medical community as a whole. Debate remains, however, about the
   definition and precise role of the humanities ill medical education,
   whether at the premedical, medical school, or postgraduate level, Recent
   trends have revealed an increasing presence of the humanities ill
   Medical training. This article reviews the literature oil the impact of
   humanities education oil the performance of medical students and
   residents and the challenges posed by the evaluation of the impact of:
   humanities in Medical education. Students who major in the humanities as
   College students perform just LIS Well, if not better, that their peers
   with science backgrounds during medical school and in residency on
   objective measures of achievement such is National Board of Medical
   Examiners scores and academic grades. Although many humanities electives
   and Courses are offered in premedical and medical school curricula,
   measuring and quantifying their impact has proven challenging because
   the Courses are diverse in content and goals. Mail, of the published
   Studies involve self-selected groups of students and seek to measure
   subjective outcomes which are difficult to measure, such as increases in
   empathy, professionalism, and self-care. Further research is needed to
   define the of optimal role for humanities education in medical training;
   in particular, more quantitative studies are needed to examine the
   impact that it may have oil physician performance beyond medical school,
   and residency. Medical educators must consider what potential benefits
   humanities education call contribute to medical education, how its
   impact can be measured, and how what ultimate outcomes we hope to
   achieve. Mt Sinai J Med 76:372-380, 2009. (C) 2009 Mount Sinai School of

Abstract = {{Objective: The nature of communication between patients and their
   second-opinion hematology consultants may be very different in these
   one-time consultations than for those that are within long-term
   relationships. This study explored patients' perceptions of their
   second-opinion hematology-oncology consultation to investigate
   physician-patient communication in malignant disease at a critical
   juncture in cancer patients' care and decision-making.
   Methods: In-depth telephone interviews with a subset of 20 patients from
   a larger study, following their subspecialty hematology consultations.
   Results: Most patients wanted to contribute to the consultation agenda,
   but were unable to do so. Patients sought expert and honest advice
   delivered with empathy, though most did not expect the consultant to
   directly address their emotions. They wanted the physician to apply
   his/her knowledge to the specifics of their individual cases, and were
   disappointed and distrustful when physicians cited only general
   prognostic statistics. In contrast, physicians' consideration of the
   unique elements of patients' cases, and demonstrations of empathy and
   respect made patients' feel positively about the encounter, regardless
   of the prognosis.
   Conclusions: Patients provided concrete recommendations for physician
   and patient behaviors to enhance the consultation.
   Practice implications: Consideration of these recommendations may result
   in more effective communication and increased patient satisfaction with
   medical visits. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second part of an analytic review of doctor-patient
   relationship (DPR) from an ethical point of view. In the previous part I
   have described and analysed the goals of and processes in different
   bioethics models of doctor-patient relationship. I have argued that the
   bioethics models of doctor-patient relationship are normative and
   prescriptive in nature and that the effectiveness of different models to
   promote their assumed goals is not assessed empirically. In this part of
   the review, I analyse different clinical models of doctor-patient
   relationship with the aim of understanding. the relation between the
   theoretical and philosophical arguments behind different models of
   doctor-patient relationship with the empirical evidence on the
   effectiveness of different models to promote their goals if implemented
   at the level of health care. The process in the DPR is at the core of
   the clinical models of DPR, namely patient-centred care model (PCC) and
   relationship-centred care model (RCC) {[}1]. Since its inception more
   than fifty years ago through the early work of Balint {[}2] and Engel
   {[}3] clinical models of DPR have gained a high profile in general
   practice and are considered a central feature of quality practice {[}4].
   In this section, I analyse through an ethical lens the concepts and
   ideas that are commonly described and empirically studied in the
   literature surrounding the clinical models of DPR. I argue that clinical
   models of DPR, similarly to bioethical models of DPR, are prescriptive
   and normative in nature. First, I describe and analyse from an ethical
   point of view the patient-centred care (PCC) model of DPR. I argue that
   some of the ethical meanings of the different dimensions of this model
   are not made clear by its proponents. Second, I describe and outline the
   relation-centred care (RCC) model of DPR and the empirical research
   surrounding the process in DPR. I describe the communication patterns
   that characterize RCC and outline the empirical research on their
   effectiveness to promote beneficence and patients' autonomy. I argue
   that there is some evidence that a process in DPR characterized by these
   communication patterns could promote both benefice and patients'
   autonomy. Third, I compare the clinical and bioethics models of
   doctor-patient relationship. I argue that the similarities between
   Brody's relational model of doctor-patient relationship and RCC model of
   doctor-patient relationship may suggest that the implementation of this
   model at the level of care could be effective to promote both
   beneficence and patient autonomy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to compare psychiatric patients' satisfaction
   with their treatment in Munich and in South Tirol. For this purpose,
   besides clinical and social-demografic factors, for each sample-group of
   patients, their general satisfaction, their valuation of the different
   aspects of hospital treatment and life quality were considered and
   compared. The relevance of these elements in the global satisfaction was
   examined with linear multiple regression models. The results of the
   research show a rather high level of global satisfaction in both
   sample-groups, even if statistically relevant differences occur in
   valuations of several aspects of the treatment. In Munich's sample-group
   a higher rate of satisfaction emerged in relation with the treatment:
   the attitude of the medical staff, the psycho-pharmalogical treatments,
   the clinic's image and the conduct of the nursing staff. In both groups
   the most relevant factor for patients' satisfaction, besides the
   positive results of the treatment, was the attitude of the doctor, and
   in particular way his empathy with the patient. In regard to the age,
   the diagnosis and the duration of the hospitalization, it wasn't
   possible to demonstrate, in both sample-groups, any statistically
   relevant connection with the general satisfaction rate, while a high
   rate of trust in the doctors and in the medicines was found to be, in
   each group, a significant condition for a positive evaluation of the
   treatment. The influence of the personal life-quality was proven
   statistically relevant but weak. Altogether, regardless of the medical
   structure that was examined, the results underline the predominant
   importance of the curing doctor's social and emotional skills for
   patients' satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the development, implementation, and psychometric
   assessment of the multiple mini-interview (MMI) for the inaugural class
   of veterinary medicine applicants at the University of Calgary Faculty
   of Veterinary Medicine (UCVM). The MMI is a series of approximately five
   to 12 10-minute interviews that consist of situational events.
   Applicants are given a scenario and asked to work through an issue or
   behavioral-type questions that are meant to assess one attribute (e.g.,
   empathy) at a time. This structure allows for multiple assessments of
   the applicants by trained interviewers on the same questions. MMI
   scenario development was based on a review of the noncognitive
   attributes currently assessed by the 31 veterinary schools across Canada
   and the United States and the goals and objectives of UCVM. The
   noncognitive attributes of applicants (N=110) were assessed at five
   stations, by two interviewers within each station, on three items using
   a standardized rating form on an anchored 1-5 scale. The method was
   determined to be reliable (G-coefficient=0.88) and demonstrated evidence
   of validity. The MMI score did not correlate with grade-point average
   (r=0.12, p=0.22). While neither the applicants nor interviewers had
   participated in an MMI format before, both groups reported the process
   to be acceptable in a post-interview questionnaire. This analysis
   provides preliminary evidence of the reliability, validity, and
   acceptability of the MMI in assessing the noncognitive attributes of
   applicants for veterinary medical school admissions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite only modest evidence linking personality-type variables to
   medical specialty choice, stereotypes involving empathy and `emotional
   connectedness' persist, especially between primary care providers and
   surgeons or subspecialists. This paper examines emotional intelligence
   (EI) and specialty choice among students at three US medical schools.
   Results from three independent studies are presented. Study 1 used the
   Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT (TM))
   administered to a single cohort of 84 Year 4 medical students. Study 2
   used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) and Davis' Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index (IRI) administered to three cohorts (n = 250) of Year 3
   medical students. Study 3 used the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory
   (EQ-I((R))) administered to two cohorts of Year 1 medical students (n =
   292). Results were linked to specialty choice data retrieved from the
   National Residency Match Program (NRMP). Classifications of specialty
   choice included: (i) primary care (family practice, internal medicine,
   paediatrics) versus non-primary care (all others), and (ii) primary
   care, hospital-based specialties (anaesthesiology, emergency medicine,
   pathology, radiology), and technical and surgical specialties
   (neurology, obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, and all surgical
   fields).
   Across all three studies - and using both classifications of specialty
   choice - no significant differences in EI were found between students
   entering primary care and non-primary care specialties. Limitations are
   acknowledged, and future directions for research involving EI are
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Professionalism should be included as a fundamental
   component in the curriculum of undergraduate as well as graduate
   students of Medicine. Future physicians should be aware of the
   attributes that a professional should possess. Aim: To analyze the ideal
   medical doctor attributes from the point of view of physicians and
   students of Medicine. Material and methods. One hundred four physicians
   (MD) and 47 student answered a free association. test on The attributes
   they would assign to a good physician. The test was applied via Internet
   to professionals, and students were tested in group dynamics at the
   beginning of the class on Bioethics and Professionalism. Data were
   processed according to The Lexical Availability Model (LAM) which
   provides quantitative as well as qualitative evaluations. Results. The
   attributes with higher scores among MD, were honesty (0.379), regular
   academic updating (0.373), ability (0.325) and empathy (0.241). Among
   students, the selected attributes were excellence (0.625), empathy
   (0.511), responsibility (0.280) and ability (0.209). A general agreement
   was found among physicians and students, excepts by the fact that MD's
   consider continuing academic updating as The most important attribute.
   Conclusions: The attributes That physicians and medical students
   evaluate as essential in professionalism were identified using the LAM
   approach. At The beginning of the career students haw a definite
   humanistic approach to their future profession (Rev Med Chile 2009;

Abstract = {{Objectives: The study aims to introduce the basic communication skills
   program for first-year medical students and to evaluate its
   effectiveness at the second level of Kirkpatrick's evaluation method.
   Material and Methods: In this study, to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the program, students were evaluated before and after the basic
   communication skills training. The students (n=127, 87\%) participating
   in both evaluations were included in the study. During the evaluations,
   each student made a 5 to 6 minute-long conversation with a simulated
   classmate performing a structured case. Each student was individually
   evaluated by his/her small group trainer using an evaluation scale
   including items on critical basic communication skills. Results: The
   total score was 57.97 +/- 10.69 for pre-training and 77.55 +/- 11.26 for
   post-training (p= 0.000). There was no significant difference between
   the pre-training scores of female and male students. The post-training
   scores of the female students were significantly higher than the scores
   of male students (p= 0.034). Conclusions: The basic communication skills
   program for first-year students was effective in gaining basic
   communication skills. The female students showed a more significant
   progress in basic communication skills than male students. This program
   and the method to evaluate its effectiveness may set an example for
   other medical schools.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine if attitudes associated with body checking,
   emotional empathy, and aggression differ between players in body
   checking and non-body checking hockey leagues and to determine the
   influence of these attitudes on injury rates.
   Design: Prospective cohort.
   Setting: Participants were randomly recruited by team from the Calgary
   Minor Hockey Association at the beginning of the 2006-2007 season.
   Participants: There were 283 participants from Pee Wee (aged 11-12
   vears), Bantam (aged 13-14 years), and Midget (aged 15-16 years) teams.
   Of 13 teams from the body checking league, 138 players participated, and
   of 24 teams in the non-body checking league, 145 players participated.
   Assessment of Risk Factors: Participants completed 4 self-report
   questionnaires: (1) Medical Questionnaire, (2) Body Checking
   Questionnaire, (3) Empathy Index for Children and Adolescents, and (4)
   Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measures: Participants were followed through the season for
   injury reports. The injury definition included any hockey injury
   resulting in medical attention, the inability to complete a hockey
   session, and/or missing a subsequent hockey session.
   Results: Body checking players reported more positive attitudes toward
   body checking (35.59; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 34.52-36.65) than
   non-body checking players (22.43; 95\%, CI, 21.38-23.49; t = -1 7.34 P <
   0.00005). There was no significant difference in the empathy scores
   between cohorts (t = 1.51 P = 0.13). The mean aggression score for the
   body checking players (76.22; 95\% CI 73.18-79.25) was significantly
   higher than the mean for the non-body checking players (70.57; 95\% CI,
   67.35-73.80; t = -2.52: P = 0.013).
   Conclusions: Body checking seems to influence attitudes toward body
   checking and aggression, but attitudes toward body checking, empathy,
   and aggression did not influence injury rates.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Reflective writing is an established method for teaching
   medical students empathetic interactions, though little is known about
   students' reflections on connecting with patients during the clinical
   clerkship. The purpose of this study was to describe factors that
   medical Students perceive contribute to or detract from making
   connections with patients and families, as identified in a writing
   assignment during the pediatric clinical clerkship.
   Methods: Reflective essays submitted by third-year medical students
   about interacting with patients/families during their pediatric
   clerkship were qualitatively analyzed for thematic content.
   Results: Major themes emerging in 44 essays analyzed included time,
   knowledge, language and culture, and actions. Barriers to connecting for
   some Students were considered resources by others. Critical reflection
   was present in 31.8\%.
   Conclusions: Students' perceptions of factors that influence their
   interactions with patients and families will enhance or detract their
   ability to make connections. Through reflection, medical students -
   amidst clinical responsibilities - can identify how, why, and whether or
   not connections with patients/families have occurred.
   Practice implications: Recognizing what factors medical students
   perceive as enhancing and detracting from connecting with
   patients/families will help preceptors foster those connections and
   mitigate barriers. Future study could assess how to best provide
   specific individualized feedback to best enhance critical reflection. We
   recommend the inclusion of brief reflective writing exercises during
   clinical clerkships in medical school, as it may augment students'
   ability to connect. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which for
   pharmaceutical students training, adequate methods should be used for
   evaluating a student's skill and aptitude for good communication in a
   medical interview. However, the reliability of the evaluation methods
   used in the pharmaceutical OSCE has not been investigated sufficiently.
   In this study, we reviewed the evaluation scores and video recordings
   obtained in a pharmaceutical OSCE trial, and examined the reasons for
   disagreement in the scores between two raters. We had two experienced
   raters in medical communication re-evaluate the students using the vide
   images, and compared their scores with those on the examination day. The
   ratio of disagreement was 14.5 \%, (87/600 items in 30 Students), and
   the reason for disagreement Could not be identified for 63 items that
   evaluated communication skills such as `actively listen' and `empathy'.
   A comparison of the scores on examination day and those on re-evaluation
   revealed a possible reason for the disagreement; the use of a checklist,
   i.e. binary scores, with criteria that differed between the raters. We
   Suggest that the items used for a detailed performance evaluation be
   selected carefully and that rating scales be used in order to perform
   ail adequate evaluation, especially regarding Communication skill and
   aptitude.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The increase in bioethics education in preclinical curricula enables
   medical students to recognize ethical issues and determine right action.
   The authors sought to explore the ethical dilemmas medical students
   experience during clinical clerkships.
   Method
   Following an e-mail invitation, 100 of 104 graduating medical students
   allowed their final ethics assignment, a written description of an
   ethical dilemma experienced during clinical clerkship, to be analyzed.
   After all identifiers were removed, the narratives underwent qualitative
   analysis and were then reanalyzed using Jameton's determinants of moral
   action.
   Results
   Four themes emerged: the clinical service rotation, target, source, and
   nature of the ethical dilemma. For many clinical clerks, the ethical
   dilemma arose because they recognized an ethical issue but neither
   brought it to their supervisors nor resolved it themselves for fear of
   incurring disfavor. The source of the ethical dilemma was most
   frequently the student's supervisor (46\%), which may explain why,
   although all narratives demonstrated the Jameton criteria of ``moral
   sensitivity{''} and 76\% demonstrated ``moral judgment,{''} only 24\%
   indicated ``moral motivation{''} and only 4\% suggested ``moral
   courage.{''} Patients were the most frequent target (76\%), followed by
   students (14\%). Students reported informed consent (18\%) and
   inadequate care (17\%) as the most common types of dilemmas under the
   nature theme.
   Conclusions
   Clinical clerks' experiences of ethical dilemmas might be mitigated if
   residency education and professional development mirrored the increase
   in preclinical ethics education, if ethics training included encouraging
   students to discuss ethical issues as they arise, and if educators
   developed innovative models of student evaluation.}},

   Preventing progression to chronicity in first onset, subacute low back
   pain: an exploratory Study. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90:545-52.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a behavioral medicine
   intervention, relative to an attention control, in preventing chronic
   pain and disability in patients with first-onset, Subacute low back pain
   (LBP) with limitations in work-role function.
   Design: A 2-group, experimental design with randomization to behavioral
   medicine or attention control groups.
   Setting: Orthopedic clinic at a Naval Medical Center.
   Participants: Sixty-seven participants with first-onset LBP of 6 to 10
   weeks of duration and impairment in work function, of whom 50 completed
   all 4 therapy sessions and follow-up 6 months after pain onset.
   Intervention: Four 1-hour individual treatment sessions of either
   behavioral medicine, focused on back function and pain education,
   self-management training, graded activity increases, fear reduction, and
   pain belief change; or attention control condition, focused on empathy,
   support, and reassurance.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was proportion of
   participants classified as recovered, according to pre-established
   clinical cutoffs on standardized measures, signifying absence of chronic
   pain and disability at 6 months after pain onset. Secondary analyses
   were conducted on pain, disability, health status, and functional work
   category. Intervention credibility and pain belief manipulation checks
   were also evaluated.
   Results: Chi square analyses comparing proportions recovered at 6 months
   after pain onset for behavioral medicine and attention control
   participants found relative rates of 52\% versus 31\% in the modified
   intent-to-treat sample (P=.09) and 54\% versus 23\% for those completing
   all 4 sessions and 6-month follow-up (P=.02). At 12 months, 79\% of
   recovered and 68\% of chronic pain participants still met criteria for
   their respective groups (P<.0001). Recovered participants also had
   higher rates of functional work status recovery at 12 months (recovered:
   96\% full duty and 4\% light duty; chronic pain: 61\% full duty, 18\%
   light duty, and 21\% medical discharge, respectively; P=.03).
   Conclusions: Early intervention using a behavioral medicine
   rehabilitation approach may enhance recovery and reduce chronic pain and
   disability in patients with first-onset, subacute LBP. Effects are
   stronger for participants attending all 4 sessions and the follow-up
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Because empathic patient interactions by dentists are associated with
   improved patient outcomes, self-reported declines in empathy during
   dental student training arc a concern. This study examined differences
   in empathy in 178 dental Students at the University of toronto and the
   University of Western Ontario from years one through four using all
   anonymous self-report web-based survey in a cross-sectional design. To
   localize the effects of training oil empathy. all instrument that
   separately evaluated emotive (Emo) and cognitive (Cog) types of empathy
   in both personal (Per) and professional (Pro) contexts was developed
   using items modified from previously validated scales and resulting in
   an empathy scale with four thirteen-item subscales (Per-Emo, Per-Cog,
   Pro-Emo, Pro-Cog). The response rate was 36.5 percent, and all subscales
   showed good reliability and validity. A 2x2x4 mixed design ANOVA tested
   differences in mean scores among the four subscales across the four
   years of training. Following a significant three-way interaction,
   subanalyses demonstrated no significant effects in the Per-context. but
   a significant Vear by empathy-type interaction in the Pro-context. Post
   hoc analyses of Pro measures indicated year till-CC emotive empathy
   scores were significantly lower than earlier years, whereas years three
   and four cognitive empathy scores were significantly higher. This
   isolated decrease in Pro-Emo empathy with an increase in Pro-Cog empathy
   is consistent with the development of professional empathy,{''}

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine whether an educational intervention that focused
   on physician communication training influenced physician ernpathic
   expression during patient interactions.
   Methods: This study used a quantitative research method to investigate
   the influence of communication training on physician-expressed empathy
   using two measures (global and hierarchical) of physician empathic
   behavior.
   Results: The differences in global empathy scores in the physician
   training group from baseline to follow-up improved by 37\%, and
   hierarchical scores of physician empathic expression improved by up to
   51\% from baseline scores for the same group.
   Conclusions: The results strongly supported the hypotheses that training
   made a significant difference in physician empathic expression during
   patient interactions demonstrated by both outside observer measures of
   global ratings and hierarchical ratings of physician empathic behavior.
   Practice implications: These findings have significant implications for
   program design and development in medical education and professional
   training with the potential to improve patient outcomes. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Objective: Communication skills, including patient-centered interviewing
   (PCI), have become a major priority for educational and licensing
   organizations in the United States. While patient-centered interviewing
   is associated with positive patient outcomes and improved diagnostic
   accuracy, it is unknown if an association exists between
   patient-centered interviewing and Student performance in high-stakes
   clinical skills assessment (CSA) examinations. The purpose of this study
   was to determine if generic communication skills and patient-centered
   interviewing skills were associated with students' overall student
   performance on a multi-station clinical skills assessment (CSA)
   examination.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study to assess student performance
   with standardized patients (SPs). We conducted a retrospective review of
   30 videotaped SP encounters of Third year medical students (class of
   2006) at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. We measured
   correlations between observed PCI scores, overall, CSA scores and CSA
   interpersonal and communication (ICS) skills Scores of student-SP
   encounters.
   Results: PCI scores, as measured with the Four-Habits Coding Scheme, a
   measurement tool of patient-centered communication, were not correlated
   with either overall CSA scores or ICS scores. Students' PCI scores were
   lower than the ICS scores (57\% vs. 85\% of correct items). The students
   performed poorly (30\% mean score of correct items) in eliciting patient
   perspectives, compared to three other domains (Invest in the beginning,
   Demonstrate empathy, and Invest in end) of patient-centered
   interviewing.
   Conclusions: Our study failed to demonstrate any association between
   student performance and patient-centered interviewing skills (PCI) in
   the setting of a comprehensive in-house CSA examination. Third-year
   medical students in our Study did not practice some elements of
   patient-centered interviewing. Practice implications: Given the
   increasing importance of patient-centered communication, the high-stakes
   in-house clinical skills examinations may consider assessing
   patient-centered interviewing using a more comprehensive and valid
   checklist. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   and compassion. The details of the moral makeup of physicians are often
   hotly debated in the biomedical literature. Despite a lack of consensus
   regarding the required aspects of character, the author demonstrates
   that little debate exists that at a minimum physicians should possess
   not only knowledge but also a willingness to care for and comfort
   patients. The primacy of the patient in the physician's life is
   reflected in the panoply of oaths taken by new physicians despite great
   variability in other aspects of these oaths. The author details recent
   worrisome reports demonstrating the erosion of medical trainees' empathy
   and compassion by long work hours. Further, the continued linkage of
   these attitude changes and fatigue to poor medical outcomes is a call to
   action. Changes enacted by the Accreditation Council for Graduate
   Medical Education to reduce resident work hours are insufficient to
   achieve the goal of improved patient care while promoting moral
   development among resident physicians. The debate regarding resident
   work hours is often framed as an idealistic discussion of placing
   patients first. However, residents are used as an inexpensive labor
   force, and efforts to curtail this usage would have a significant
   economic impact. Economic concerns play a larger part in decision making
   than is generally discussed. The author calls for further alterations of
   resident work schedules to improve patient care and ensure the
   preservation of the moral ethos of medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Medical professionals are a community of highly educated individuals
   with a commitment to a core set of ideals and principles. This community
   provides both technical and ethical socialization. The development of
   ethical physicians is highly linked to experiences in the training
   period. Moral traits are situation-sensitive psychological and
   behavioral dispositions. The consequence of long duty hours on the moral
   development of physicians is less understood. The clinical environment
   of medical training programs can be so intense as to lead to conditions
   that may actually deprofessionalize trainees. The dynamic relationship
   between individual character traits and the situational dependence of
   their expression suggests that a systems approach will help promote and
   nurture moral development. Ethical behavior can be supported by systems
   that make it more difficult to veer from the ideal. Work hours limits
   are a structural change that will help preserve public safety by
   preventing physicians from taking the moral shortcuts that can occur
   with increasing work and time pressures. Work hours rules are beneficial
   but insufficient to optimize an ethical work and training environment.
   Additional measures need to be put in place to ensure that ethical
   tensions are not created between the patient's well-being and the
   resident's adherence to work hours rules. The ethical ideals of
   physician autonomy, selflessness, and accountability to the patient must
   be protected through the judicious and flexible use of work hours
   limits, physician extenders, census caps, nonteaching services, and
   high-quality handoffs.}},

Abstract = {{A Study was conducted involving a group of 290 medical and dental
   students to directly compare perceived stress levels encountered during
   their education. A modified questionnaire based on Garbee et al.'s
   Dental Environmental Stress survey was provided to the Students by
   either email or paper. The purpose of the investigation was to determine
   if the Sources of stress reported by medical and dental Students, both
   male and female, were due to common factors. A multivariate statistical
   analysis was also conducted to measure stress differences by year in
   school. Through factor analysis, the Survey question responses were
   grouped into five causal categories: academic performance. faculty
   relations, patient and clinic responsibilities, personal life issues,
   and professional identity. The overall findings show that dental
   Students had greater levels of stress than medical Students in three of
   the five categories. The only category in which medical Students
   demonstrated greater stress levels than dental Students was in
   professional identity. Measures of comparative levels of stress between
   male and female students for either profession did not demonstrate any
   significant differences. Stress levels related to clinical work varied
   significantly between the type of professional student and his or her
   year in school.}},

Abstract = {{Discharge against medical advice (AMA), in which a patient chooses to
   leave the hospital before the treating physician recommends discharge,
   continues to be a common and vexing problem. This article reviews the
   prevalence, costs, predictors, and potential Interventions for this
   clinical problem. Between 1\% and 2\% of all medical admissions result
   In an AMA discharge. Predictors of AMA discharge, based primarily on
   retrospective cohort studies, tended to be younger age, Medicaid or no
   Insurance, male sex, and current or a history of substance or alcohol
   abuse. Interventions to reduce the rate of AMA discharges have not been
   systematically studied. This article offers suggestions for
   Interventions based on studies in other areas of clinical care as well
   as the psychiatric AMA discharge literature. Studies for this review
   were Identified by searching the relevant MeSH heading (discharge) and
   key words (against medical advice, leave, elope, hospital, and
   self-discharge) In PubMed databases and selecting all English-language
   articles from 1970 through 2008 that Included data on adult medical

Abstract = {{Objective: To present a model of the medical consultation as a value
   chain, and to apply a neurobehavioral perspective to analyze each
   element in the chain with relevance for emotion regulation.
   Methods: Current knowledge on four elements in medical consultations and
   neuroscientific evidence on corresponding basic processes are
   selectively reviewed.
   Results: The four elements of communication behaviours presented as
   steps in a value chain model are: (1) establishing rapport, (2) patient
   disclosure of emotional Cues and concerns, (3) the doctor's expression
   of empathy, and (4) positive reappraisal of concerns.
   Conclusion: The metaphor of the value chain, with emphasis on goal
   orientation, helps to understand the impact of each communicative
   element on the outcome of the consultation. Added value at each step is
   proposed in terms of effects on outcome indicators; in this case
   patients affect regulation. Neurobehavioral mechanisms are suggested to
   explain the association between communication behaviour and affect
   regulation outcome.
   Practice implications: The value chain metaphor and the emphasis on
   behaviour-outcome-mechanisms associations may be of interest as
   conceptualizations for communications skills training. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: To establish sound empirical evidence that clinical empathy
   (abbreviated as CE) is a core element in the clinician-patient
   relationship with profound therapeutic potential, a substantial
   theoretical-based understanding of CE in medical care and medical
   education is still required. The two aims of the present paper are,
   therefore, (1) to give a multidisciplinary overview of the ``nature{''}
   and ``specific effectiveness{''} of CE, and (2) to use this base as a
   means of deriving relevant questions for a theory-based research agenda.
   Method: We made an effort to identify cut-rent and past literature about
   conceptual and empirical work focusing on empathy and CE, which derives
   from a Multiplicity of disciplines. We review the material in a
   structured fashion.
   Results: We describe the ``nature{''} of empathy by briefly Summarizing
   concepts and models from Sociology, psychology, social psychology,
   education, (social-)epidemiology, and neurosciences. To explain the
   ``specific effectiveness{''} of CE for patients, we develop the ``Effect
   model of empathic communication in the clinical encounter{''}, which
   demonstrates how an empathically communicating clinician can achieve
   improved patient outcomes. Both parts of theoretical findings are
   synthesized in a theory-based research agenda with the following key
   hypotheses: (1) CE is a determinant of quality in medical care, (2)
   clinicians biographical experiences influence their empathic behavior,
   and (3) CE is affected by situational factors.
   Conclusion: The main conclusions of our review are twofold. First of
   all, CE seems to be a fundamental determinant of quality in medical
   care, because it enables the clinician to fulfill key medical tasks more
   accurately, thereby achieving enhanced patient health outcomes. Second,
   the integration of biographical experiences and situational factors as
   determinants of CE in medical care and medical education appears to be
   crucial to develop and promote CE and ultimately ensuring high-quality
   patient care.
   Practice implications: Due to the complexity and multidimensionality of
   CE, evidence-based investigations of the derived hypotheses require both
   well-designed qualitative and quantitative studies as well as an
   interdisciplinary research approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {{Evaluation of a communication skills program for first-year medical
   students at the University of Toronto}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},

Abstract = {{Background: Effective doctor-patient communication has been linked to
   numerous benefits for both patient and physician. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the University of Toronto's
   Therapeutic Communication Program (TCom) at improving first-year medical
   students' communication skills.
   Methods: Data were collected during the 1996/97, 1997/98, 1998/99 and
   1999/00 academic years. The study used a repeated measures design with a
   waiting list control group: students were randomly assigned to groups
   starting the educational intervention in either September (N = 38) or
   February (N = 41), with the latter being used as a control for the
   former. Communication skills were assessed at the pre-and
   post-intervention times and at the end of the academic year from the
   perspectives of student, standardized patient and external rater.
   Results: Only the external rater, using an instrument designed to assess
   the students' empathy based on their written responses, showed a time x
   group interaction effect (p = 0.039), thereby partially supporting the
   hypothesis that TCom improved the students' communication skills.
   Students rated themselves less positively after participation in the
   program (p = 0.038), suggesting that self-evaluation was an ineffective
   measure of actual performance or that the program helped them learn to
   more accurately assess their abilities.
   Conclusion: The lack of strong findings may be partly due to the study's
   small sample sizes. Further research at other medical or professional
   schools could assess the effectiveness of similar courses on students'
   communication skills and on other capacities that were not measured in
   this study, such as their understanding of and comfort with patients,
   their management of the doctor-patient relationship, and their ability
   to give and receive feedback.}},

Title = {{A qualitative study of patients' views on quality of primary care
   consultations in Hong Kong and comparison with the UK CARE Measure}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients' priorities and views on quality care are
   well-documented in Western countries but there is a dearth of research
   in this area in the East. The aim of the present study was to explore
   Chinese patients' views on quality of primary care consultations in Hong
   Kong and to compare these with the items in the CARE measure (a process
   measure of consultation quality widely used in the UK) in order to
   assess the potential utility of the CARE measure in a Chinese
   population.
   Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted on 21
   adult patients from 3 different primary care clinics (a public primary
   healthcare clinic, a University health centre, and a private family
   physician's clinic). Topics discussed included expectations,
   experiences, and views about quality of medical consultations.
   Interviews were typed verbatim, and a thematic approach was taken to
   identify key issues. These identified issues were then compared with the
   ten CARE measure items, using a CARE framework: Connecting (Care Measure
   items 1-3), Assessing (item 4), Responding (items 5,6), and Empowering
   (items 7-10).
   Results: Patients judged doctors in terms of both the process of the
   consultation and the perceived outcomes. Themes identified that related
   to the interpersonal process of the consultation fitted well under the
   CARE framework; Connecting and communicating (18/21 patients), Assessing
   holistically (10/21 patients), Responding (18/21 patients) and
   Empowering (19/21 patients). Patients from the public clinic, who were
   generally of lower socio-economic status, were least likely to expect
   holistic care or empowerment. Two-thirds of patients also judged doctors
   on whether they performed an adequate physical examination, and
   three-quarters on the later outcomes of consultation (in terms of relief
   or cure and/or side-effects of prescribed drugs).
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that Chinese patients in Hong Kong
   value engaged, empathic primary care doctors and judge the quality of
   consultations largely on these human skills and the attitudes and values
   that underpin them, as well as on the perceived outcomes of treatment.
   The match between themes relating to consultation process and the CARE
   Measure items suggests utility of this measure in this population, but
   further quantitative validation is required.}},

Abstract = {{The working alliance has been shown to be a consistent predictor of
   patient outcome and satisfaction in psychotherapy. This study examines
   the role of the working alliance and related behavioral indices in
   predicting medical outcome.
   Cognitive and emotional dimensions of the physician-patient relationship
   were examined in relation to patients' ratings of physician empathy,
   physician multicultural competence, perceived utility of treatment, and
   patients' adherence self-efficacy. These factors were then examined as
   part of a theoretical framework using path analyses to explain patient
   self-reported adherence to and satisfaction with treatment.
   The study was based on an ex-post facto field correlation design.
   One hundred fifty-two adult outpatients from a neurology clinic at
   Bellevue Hospital, a large municipal hospital in New York City,
   participated in the study.
   Surveys given to participants.
   We used the following measurements: Physician-Patient Working Alliance
   Scale, Perceived Utility Scale, Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale,
   Medical Outcome Study Adherence Scale, Physician Empathy Questionnaire,
   Physician Multicultural Competence Questionnaire, Medical Patient
   Satisfaction Questionnaire.
   The effect sizes for adherence are between 0.07 and 0.21 and for
   satisfaction between 0.10 to > 0.50. Regression and path analyses showed
   that ratings of physician multicultural competence and patient adherence
   self-efficacy beliefs predicted patient adherence (SB = 0.34) and (SB =
   0.30) and satisfaction (SB = 0.18) and (SB = 0.12), respectively.
   Working alliance ratings also predicted patient satisfaction (SB =
   0.49).
   Psychological and interpersonal dimensions of medical care are related
   to patient adherence and satisfaction. Medical care providers may be
   able to use these dimensions to target and improve health care outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Discussions of empathy in health care offer important ways of enabling
   communication and interpersonal connection that are therapeutic for the
   patient and satisfying for the physician. While the best of these
   discussions offer valuable insights into the patient-physician
   relationship, many of them lack an action component for alleviating the
   patient's suffering and emphasize the physician's experience of empathy
   rather than the patient's experience of illness.
   By examining educational methods, such as reflective writing exercises
   and the study of literary texts, and by analyzing theoretical approaches
   to empathy and suggestions for clinical practice, this article considers
   how to mindfully keep the focus on what the patient is going through.
   Clinical empathy can be improved by strategies that address (1) the
   patient's authority in providing first-person accounts of illness and
   disability, (2) expanding the concept of empathy to include an action
   component geared toward relieving patients' suffering, and (3) the
   potential value of extending empathy to include the social context of
   illness.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine how professional commitment influences patient
   safety and patient-perceived care quality.
   Design: Investigators for this Study used a cross-sectional design with
   questionnaires. A total of 348 pairs of nurses and inpatients were
   contacted at two medical centers in Taiwan during the period from August
   2007 to January 2008, yielding 284 pairs of completed questionnaires.
   Methods: Frequencies of six adverse patient events were used to measure
   patient safety; and the Service Quality Scale was used to measure
   patient-perceived care quality. Four items of the Professional
   Commitment Questionnaire were used to measure professional commitment.
   Regressions were used for the analyses.
   Findings: Professional commitment positively influenced overall patient
   safety (beta=.19, p=.00) and overall patient-perceived care quality
   (beta=.13, p=.03). Furthermore, professional commitment positively
   influenced all patient safety indicators (beta >=.12, p <=.04), except
   frequency of nosocomial infections, the coefficient of which reached
   borderline significance (beta=.11, p=.07). Professional commitment also
   positively influenced care quality ill terms of responsiveness(beta=.16,
   p=.01) and empathy (beta=.14, p=.03).
   Conclusions: Professional commitment may enhance patient safety and
   patient-perceived care quality. Clinical Relevance: This study indicates
   that nurse professional commitment can enhance patient safety and
   patient-perceived care quality.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the dialogue between telephone operators at medical emergency
   communication centres in Norway and parents of children later diagnosed
   with sudden infant death syndrome. The aim was to understand how the
   parents experienced the communication with the telephone operators. The
   qualitative method involved semi-structured interviews. We interviewed
   six respondents from urban areas and five from rural areas. An important
   finding was that all the parents were satisfied with the resuscitation
   instructions they received. It was also perceived as important that the
   emergency operators expressed empathy and care. We believe that it is
   not merely the quality of the resuscitation attempts that the operators'
   efforts should be measured against. It is also important that the
   operators provide good explanations and express emotional support. Our
   findings indicate that this will be enormously appreciated, even if
   callers do not feel that they are capable of performing optimum
   resuscitation.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{528-534}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient-centered communication skills, such as an empathic
   attitude towards patients and a holistic perspective on health, are
   difficult to acquire. Designing effective courses requires better
   understanding of the difficulties that students perceive with learning
   to talk with patients
   Aims: The study aimed at exploring students' common difficulties with
   learning patient-centered communication skills.
   Methods: Group discussions about student-patient interviews were
   videotaped and analyzed with regard to issues that students perceived as
   difficult and to their reflections about these difficulties.
   Results: The students reported feeling intrusive as they explored the
   patient's psychosocial situation. They avoided being empathic and felt
   insecure about coping adequately with emotionally loaded topics. Their
   difficulties were mainly due to insufficient understanding of the
   functional relations between psychosocial issues and health conditions.
   Moreover, students were insecure concerning the function of affective
   feedback in the diagnostic process. However, the group discussions
   generated a language for analyzing and structuring interviews that
   helped develop the students' professional identities.
   Conclusions: Students experienced moral qualms about applying major
   aspects of patient-centered interviewing. Instruction in communication
   skills should aim at filling the students' knowledge gaps and fostering
   their awareness and expression of emotional perceptions. Long-term
   relationships with patients could help develop patient-centered
   communication.}},

Title = {{Are medical students agreeable? An exploration of personality in
   relation to clinical skills training}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{E311-E315}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinical competencies like trust, empathy, and cooperation
   are emphasized in medical school curricula. Agreeableness, a personality
   domain, reflects these competencies. It is unclear, however, whether
   medical student personality is intrinsically agreeable.
   Aim: We explored whether medical student personality reflects
   Agreeableness, and compared student Agreeableness with that of police
   officer recruits, a group in which high Agreeableness is not preferred.
   Methods: Students and recruits completed the Revised NEO Personality
   Inventory, which measures domains of the five-factor model: Neuroticism,
   Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.
   Results: Medical student Agreeableness was at average levels. Students
   were high in Extraversion and Openness, reflecting personal growth,
   leadership, problem solving, and influencing. Relative to recruits,
   students had higher Neuroticism and Openness and lower
   Conscientiousness. Agreeableness and Extraversion did not differ. Using
   discriminant analysis, Neuroticism, Openness, and Conscientiousness
   accurately classified 77\% of students and recruits.
   Conclusion: Medical students were not inordinately agreeable. They were
   ambitious, intellectually-creative problem solvers with a preference to
   direct/influence. Clinical skills training that acknowledges this style
   may enhance clinical education processes. Model-based methods for
   clinical skills-including agenda-setting, conflict resolution, and
   alliance making - that require mastery of techniques and have
   evidence-based relevance to patient care may be useful adjuncts to
   conventional clinical training.}},

Abstract = {{In ``Theory Is Personal,{''} Allen Siegel MD, a Chicago psychoanalyst
   and Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Rush University
   Medical Center, shares the very personal story of how he came to his
   theory. Sometimes we find our theory. Other times, Siegel argues, it is
   our theory that finds us. In this article Siegel catalogues his early
   encounters with figures-contemporary and real-from Sigmund Freud to
   influential department chairs to an analyst who would become legendary
   for introducing a bold new theory into the psychoanalytic canon.
   Charting key experiences that shaped his adoption of this new approach-a
   depression in response to his first patient, a clinical treatment with
   Heinz Kohut, and exposure to others who dared to challenge Freud-Siegel
   describes the theory that brought both himself and his patients to life.
   After outlining the principles that guide the new theory and practice
   known as self psychology, Siegel tells of the empathic ambiance that
   call now emerge in the consulting room. Finally, he shows how this new
   theory of human motivation provides not merely a rationale for
   psychotherapy but an explanatory apparatus for understanding human
   action ill the world beyond the consulting room. He turns to a brief
   study of aggression and war, as expressed in a 1932 correspondence
   between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, to illustrate how the
   understanding of aggression and war changes significantly when empathy
   is the field's data collecting instrument.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   requires residency training programs to develop methods to teach and
   assess communication skills in residents to ensure competence as a
   practitioner. In response, we piloted a communication curriculum for
   emergency medicine residents. We describe the curriculum and suggest
   future directions for development based on the strengths and weaknesses
   of residents' performance and their reactions to the curriculum.
   Description: Twenty-six residents in a 3-year program at a
   university-affiliated county hospital participated. Curriculum
   components were an introductory session, a single standardized patient
   encounter using a locally written, unvalidated checklist assessing
   residents' communication skills, a videotape-facilitated
   self-assessment, and a private feedback session. Evaluation: Residents
   demonstrated greatest strengths in basic interpersonal skills and
   efficient information gathering and greatest weakness in empathy.
   Residents rated the curriculum favorably. Conclusion: The curriculum as
   implemented offers an initial foundation for teaching and learning
   critical care communication. Instruction in empathy requires
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Narrative writing has been used to promote reflection and increased
   self-awareness among physicians. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the impact of prompted narrative writing on reflection.
   Thirty-two interns at 9 internal medicine residency programs
   participated in a year-long qualitative study about personal growth
   beginning in July of 2002. Interns wrote narratives every 8 weeks. At
   study completion, interns wrote a final narrative describing the affect
   that being in the study had on them. Responses were reviewed and
   organized into domains. Writing throughout the year resulted in
   reflection and encouraged interns to reconsider their core values and
   priorities. Some found that the exercise promoted greater self-awareness
   and provided an emotional outlet. Writing about difficult experiences
   coupled with reflection motivated some interns to want to improve.
   Prompted narrative writing led to reflection among interns and promoted
   self-awareness. Educators may consider incorporating narrative writing
   into residency education.}},

Abstract = {{The 2007 Streeten Lecture focused on the idea that physical
   deconditioning plays a key role in the symptomology and pathophysiology
   of POTS. Parallels were drawn between the physiological responses to
   orthostatic stress seen in POTS patients and the physiological responses
   seen in ``normal{''} humans after prolonged periods of bedrest,
   deconditioning, or space flight. Additionally, the idea that endurance
   exercise training might ameliorate some of these symptoms was also
   advanced. Finally, potential parallels between POTS, chronic fatigue
   syndrome, and fibromyalgia were also drawn and the potential role of
   exercise training as a ``therapeutic intervention{''} in all three
   conditions was raised. The conceptual model for the lecture was that
   after some ``initiating event{''} chronic deconditioning plays a
   significant role in the pathophysiology of these conditions, and these
   physiological changes in conjunction with ``somatic hypervigilence{''}
   explain many of the complaints that this diverse group of patients have.
   Additionally, the idea that systematic endurance exercise training might
   be helpful was advanced, and data supportive of this idea was reviewed.
   The main conclusion is that the medical community must retain their
   empathy for patients with unusual conditions but at the same time send a
   firm but empowering message about physical activity. As always, we must
   also ask what do the ideas about physical activity and inactivity and
   the conditions mentioned above not explain?.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate structural and psychological factors that lead
   non-urgent patients to choose the Accidents \& Emergency Department
   (A\&ED) rather than primary care services.
   Data sources: Data were collected through interviews by means of a
   structured questionnaire. Data regarding the A\&ED sample were also
   drawn from the database of the department.
   Study design: Hypotheses were tested in a survey comparing A\&ED
   non-urgent patients and patients using GP surgeries. Different
   perceptions of the characteristics of A\&ED and primary care services
   were measured and a perceptual map was created using the linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA).
   Data collection: Emergency services users were interviewed in the A\&ED
   of the General Hospital of the Province of Macerata (Italy). Primary
   care users were interviewed in four GP surgeries. 527 patients were
   interviewed between December 2006 and February 2007.
   Principal findings: A\&ED and primary care patients look for different
   characteristics as diagnostic and therapeutic potentialities, empathy
   and competence, quick access or long-lasting relationship. Information
   asymmetry explains part of the behaviour. Conclusions: Use of A\&ED
   services for non-urgent care can be reduced.
   The understanding of reasons underlying the choice and a change in
   access, timing and contents of care/services provided by general
   practitioners (GPs) might provide incentives for shifting from A\&ED to
   GPs surgeries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: The hidden (informal) curriculum is blamed for its
   negative effects on students' humanism and professional development. To
   combat this, educational initiatives employing mentored reflective
   practice, faculty role-modeling, and feedback have been advocated.
   AIM: Promote reflection on professional development using collaborative,
   web-based technology.
   SETTING: Four-week basic medicine clerkship rotation at an academic
   institution over a one-year period.
   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Students were asked to contribute two reflective
   postings to a class web log (blog) during their rotation. They were able
   to read each other's postings and leave feedback in a comment section.
   An instructor provided feedback on entries, aimed to stimulate further
   reflection. Students could choose anonymous names if desired.
   PROGRAM EVALUATION: Ninety-one students wrote 177 posts. One-third of
   students left feedback comments. The majority of students enjoyed the
   activity and found the instructor's feedback helpful. Assessment of the
   posts revealed reflections on experience, heavily concerned with
   behavior and affect. A minority were not reflective. In some cases, the
   instructor's feedback stimulated additional reflection. Certain posts
   provided insight to the hidden curriculum.
   DISCUSSION: We have discovered that blogs can promote reflection,
   uncover elements of the hidden curriculum, and provide opportunities to
   promote professional development.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Instruments are needed to measure the influence of cancer on quality of
   life in the expanding population of long-term cancer survivors. We
   conducted refinement and psychometric evaluation of the Impact of Cancer
   (IOC) scale by use of data from a large sample of long-term breast
   cancer survivors and developed an instrument, the Impact of Cancer
   version 2 (IOCv2), to measure quality of life outcomes.
   Methods
   Questionnaires including 81 potential IOC scale items, the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Breast Cancer
   Prevention Trial (BCPT) symptom scales, as well as demographic,
   treatment, and medical information, were completed by 1188 disease-free
   breast cancer survivors 5-10 years after diagnosis. We used exploratory
   factor analysis to identify scales and assessed reproducibility by
   split-sample cross-validation. Higher-order scales were extracted and
   all scales were evaluated for internal consistency and construct and
   concurrent validity.
   Results
   The analysis yielded a factor structure relating IOC items to
   psychosocial impact domains that exhibited high factor loadings
   (factor-item correlations of 0.59-0.94), high internal consistency
   (Cronbach's alpha statistics of 0.76-0.89), and a total congruence of
   0.98 across the split samples. The Impact of Cancer version 2 (IOCv2)
   scales consist of a Positive Impact Summary scale with four subscales
   (Altruism and Empathy, Health Awareness, Meaning of Cancer, and Positive
   Self-Evaluation), a Negative Impact Summary scale with four subscales
   (Appearance Concerns, Body Change Concerns, Life Interferences, and
   Worry), and subscales for Employment and Relationship Concerns. Patterns
   of association between IOCv2 scale scores and CES-D and BCPT scores
   indicated good concurrent validity. Patterns of associations between
   IOCv2 scale scores and demographic, medical, and treatment
   characteristics indicated good construct validity.
   Conclusion
   The IOCv2 scales provide a validated tool for measuring the impact of
   cancer on quality of life in long-term cancer survivors.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE The treatment a patient receives is greatly affected by what he
   or she chooses to disclose to a physician. This qualitative study
   investigated such factors as culture and background that contribute to
   Latina patients' nondisclosure of medical information.
   METHODS Participants were 28 Latina women living in Brooklyn. in-depth
   interviews in English or Spanish were conducted and documented by
   extensive notes. We used a grounded theory approach to find emerging
   themes, which were coded using a continuous iterative process.
   RESULTS Six primary themes emerged: the physician-patient relationship,
   language, physician sex and age, time constraints, sensitive health
   issues, and culture and birthplace. Such qualities as compassion,
   caring, human interest, and kindness were important to many Latinas, who
   did not feel safe sharing information if these qualities were absent.
   Language barriers caused problems with physician-patient interaction,
   which were complicated by the presence of a translator. Physicians being
   male or younger could make disclosure difficult, especially around
   issues of sexuality and genital examination. Time constraints and
   cultural differences sometimes resulted in physicians' lack of awareness
   of sensitive areas that patients did not wish to discuss, such as
   sexuality, family planning, domestic abuse, and use of recreational
   drugs. Birthplace (foreign born vs US born) played a role in how the
   women perceived barriers to disclosure.
   CONCLUSIONS Staff training in techniques for building rapport can foster
   better communication, increase empathy and compassion, and lead to the
   establishment of trusting relationships in which disclosure is more
   likely. Ann Fam Med 2008;6:543-549. DOI: 10.1370/afm.912.}},

Abstract = {{There ere 65 third-year medical students and 59 pediatric residents who
   participated. The intervention was a 40-minute multimedia program that
   teaches how to counsel parents about childhood aggression. Comparing
   pre- and 2-month postintervention data, there was an increase in the
   proportion of medical students (11\% pre vs 92\% post; P < .001) and
   residents (3\% pre vs 9 5\% posts P < .001) who felt that their ability,
   to counsel parents about hurtful behavior was high or very high.
   Compared with baseline, a higher proportion of trainees at the 2-month
   follow-up recommended redirecting (11\% pre vs 69\% post; P < .001),
   promoting empathy (13\% pre vs 42\% post; P < .001), and not using
   physical punishment (25\% pre vs 50\% post; P < .001). A brief,
   independently viewed curriculum addition expanded the repertoire of
   health care trainees related to counseling parents about childhood
   aggression. These findings have implications for violence prevention.}},

Abstract = {{On the night of August 19, 2000, at the foot of Castel del Monte, an
   8-year-old girl was brutally murdered. The perpetrators were identified
   as five young men who captured their victim and sexually abused her. The
   policemen found the cadaver by following ``Mario,{''} one of the five,
   who had been discovered lying on the ground, near the castle.
   Investigation led to demonstrate that the murder was not premeditated.
   The only desire of the group was to sexually molest the little girl.
   Mario showed signs of psychiatric pathology and for that he underwent
   psychiatric evaluation by judicial authorities. Analysis of this case,
   combined with a criminological and medical-legal perspective led to
   conclusions very much different from the expectations of Mario's defense
   attorneys. Mario, a marginal figure and seemingly the least intelligent,
   played the role of group instigator, both in the initiation of sexually
   abusing the child, as well as in the elimination of an inconvenient
   witness. However, the group was able to activate Mario's sadistic
   fantasies and his sexual perversions, and he ended up in a catalyzing
   role influencing the behavior of others and realizing what would
   otherwise remain only fantasies. The circularity of the group allows
   people like Mario, who are apparently subordinate, to influence the
   behavior of others. Mario was found to have a mental disorder but it was
   not sufficient to diminish his personal responsibility related to the
   crime. In fact, according to Italian judicial code, it is necessary that
   the motivation for the crime was psychopathological. It was for this
   reason that, according to Italian law, all of the members of the group
   were considered to be responsible for the crimes committed and were
   condemned.}},

Title = {{Cognitive Expertise, Emotional Development, and Reflective Capacity:
   Clinical Skills for Improved Pain Care}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{975-983}},

Abstract = {{The overarching goal of medical training is to nurture the growth of
   knowledgeable, caring, and insightful clinicians guided by the ideals of
   medical professionalism. Recent definitions of professional competence
   identify essential clinical skills, including cognitive expertise,
   emotional competence, and reflective capacity. This modern framework
   reflects the increasingly complex nature of the patient-clinician
   interaction, in which the clinician must exchange diagnostic information
   while supportively engaging the patient on a deeper, affective level.
   The affective dimension can be particularly potent when pain is the
   primary symptom, as it is for the majority of medical visits.
   Unfortunately, however, current models of professionalism, used as an
   early guide for medical trainees to develop an understanding of the
   clinical exchange, largely focus on interactions in the cognitive
   domain. To emphasize the importance of emotions in professional
   development, we propose the Cognitive and Emotional Preparedness Model,
   which describes the clinical encounter occurring on two channels, one
   cognitive and the other emotional, and stresses the importance of
   multidimensional development in preparing the clinician to (1)
   communicate clinical information, (2) provide emotional support, and (3)
   actively reflect on experiences for continued improvement. Together,
   acquisition of knowledge, emotional development, and reflective skill
   will improve the clinical interaction.
   Perspective: The proficiency of medical trainees in developing clinical
   skills profoundly shapes patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes.
   This article reviews the cognitive, emotional, and reflective
   development of medical trainees and presents a model illustrating how
   clinical development impacts pain care. For improved efficacy, pain
   education should be calibrated to students' developmental needs. (C)

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Patients who leave hospitals against medical advice (AMA)
   may be at risk for adverse health outcomes. Their decision to leave may
   not be clearly understood by providers. This study explored providers'
   experiences with and attitudes toward patients who leave the hospital
   AMA.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore providers' experiences with and attitudes toward
   patients who leave the hospital AMA.
   METHODS: We conducted interviews with university-based internal medicine
   residents and practicing internal medicine clinicians caring for
   patients at a community hospital from July 2006 to August 2007. We
   approached 34 providers within 3 days of discharging a patient AMA. The
   semi-structured instrument elicited perceptions of care, emotions, and
   challenges faced when caring for patients who leave AMA. Using an
   editing analysis style, investigators independently coded transcripts,
   agreeing on the coding template and its application.
   PARTICIPANTS: All 34 providers (100\%) participated. Providers averaged
   32.6 years of age, 22 (61\%) were men, 20 (59\%) were housestaff from
   three residency programs, 13 (38\%) were faculty, hospitalist
   physicians, or chief residents serving as ward attendings, and one (3\%)
   was a physician assistant.
   MAIN RESULTS: Four themes emerged: 1) providers' beliefs that patients
   lack insight into their medical conditions; 2) suboptimal communication,
   mistrust, and conflict; 3) providers' attempts to empathize with
   patients' concerns; and 4) providers' professional roles and obligations
   toward patients who leave AMA.
   CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that patients who leave AMA influence
   providers' perceptions of their patients' insight, and their own
   patient-provider communication, empathy for patients, and professional
   roles and obligations. Future research should investigate educational
   interventions to optimize patient-centered communication and support
   providers in their decisional conflicts when these challenging
   patient-provider discussions occur.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important in patient-physician communication and
   is associated with improved patient satisfaction and adherence to
   physicians' recommendations.
   Methods: To evaluate empathic opportunities and physician responses, we
   conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of 20 audiorecorded,
   transcribed consultations between patients with lung cancer and their
   thoracic surgeons or oncologists, from a larger observational study of
   137 patients in a Veterans Affairs hospital in the southern United
   States. Using qualitative analysis, we collaboratively developed themes
   and subthemes until saturation. Then, each transcript was coded, using
   grounded theory methods, until consensus was achieved, counting and
   sequentially analyzing patient empathic opportunities and physician
   responses.
   Results: Subthemes regarding patients' statements about lung cancer
   included (1) morbidity or mortality concerns, (2) cancer-related
   symptoms, (3) relationship to smoking, (4) decisions about treatment,
   (5) beliefs about or mistrust of medical care, (6) factors limiting
   ability to treat cancer, and (7) confusion regarding cancer status and
   treatment. We identified 384 empathic opportunities and found that
   physicians had responded empathically to 39 (10\%) of them. Otherwise,
   physicians provided little emotional support, often shifting to
   biomedical questions and statements. We defined this phenomenon as
   missed opportunities for ``interval empathy.{''} When empathy was
   provided, 50\% of these statements occurred in the last one-third of the
   encounter, whereas patients' concerns were evenly raised throughout the
   encounter.
   Conclusions: Physicians rarely responded empathically to the concerns
   raised by patients with lung cancer, and empathic responses that did
   occur were more frequently in the last third of the encounter. Our
   results may provide a typologic approach to help physicians recognize
   empathic opportunities and with further development may aid in improving
   physicians' communication skills.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the prevalence of suicidal ideation
   among U.S. medical students or how it relates to burnout.
   Objective: To assess the frequency of suicidal ideation among medical
   students and explore its relationship with burnout.
   Design: Cross-sectional 2007 and longitudinal 2006 to 2007 cohort study.
   Setting: 7 medical schools in the United States.
   Participants: 4287 medical students at 7 medical schools, with students
   at 5 institutions studied longitudinally.
   Measurements: Prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past year and its
   relationship to burnout, demographic characteristics, and quality of
   life.
   Results: Burnout was reported by 49.6\% (95\% CI, 47.5\% to 51.8\%) of
   students, and 11.2\% (CI, 9.9\% to 12.6\%) reported suicidal ideation
   within the past year. In a sensitivity analysis that assumed all
   nonresponders did not have suicidal ideation, the prevalence of suicidal
   ideation in the past 12 months would be 5.8\%. In the longitudinal
   cohort, burnout (P < 0.001 for all domains), quality of life (P < 0.002
   for each domain), and depressive symptoms (P < 0.001) at baseline
   predicted suicidal ideation over the following year. In multivariable
   analysis, burnout and low mental quality of life at baseline were
   independent predictors of suicidal ideation over the following year. Of
   the 370 students who met criteria for burnout in 2006, 99 (26.8\%)
   recovered. Recovery from burnout was associated with markedly less
   suicidal ideation, which suggests that recovery from burnout decreased
   suicide risk.
   Limitation: Although response rates (52\% for the cross-sectional study
   and 65\% for the longitudinal cohort study) are typical of physician
   surveys, nonresponse by some students reduces the precision of the
   estimated frequency of suicidal ideation and burnout.
   Conclusion: Approximately 50\% of students experience burnout and 10\%
   experience suicidal ideation during medical school. Burnout seems to be
   associated with increased likelihood of subsequent suicidal ideation,
   whereas recovery from burnout is associated with less suicidal ideation.}},

Abstract = {{In communicating with patients, especially patients receiving palliative
   care, empathy plays an important role. Little research has as yet been
   conducted into the development of the empathetic capacity of nursing
   students at various educational levels. An instrument that may be
   suitable for such research is the Staff-Patient Interaction Response
   Scale for Palliative Care Nursing (SPIRS-PCN). The purpose of the
   article is to determine the validity and reliability of the SPIRS-PCN,
   an instrument measuring empathy in palliative care. The
   criterion-related validity, homogeneity, and interrater reliability of
   the SPIRS-PCN were determined in nursing students (n = 357) who varied
   in gender, age, religious orientation, educational level, and experience
   in patient care. The validity of the SPIRS-PCN was underlined by
   identification of differences for religious orientation and the amount
   of experience. The variables gender, age, and educational level were not
   significant in relation to SPIRS-PCN scores. The homogeneity (Cronbach's
   alpha = .80) and interrater reliability (.74) of the instrument were
   adequate. We conclude that validity of the SPIRS-PCN was partially
   supported, whereas reliability was demonstrated. The instrument is
   feasible in educational situations; we recommend further research into
   the instrument's validity, especially in the progression of students'
   scores during the study program.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe the doctor-patient
   relationship as expressed in written comments to a retiring family
   physician.
   Methods: All 200 of the written notes and e-mails to a single family
   physician retiring after 42 years in practice were examined using
   content analysis for general themes and meaning. No phone or personal
   verbal responses were included.
   Results: Seven themes emerged with regards to what patients appreciated
   in their family physician relationship. These included ``being
   there,{''} caring, medical expertise, personal characteristics, multiple
   roles/anything goes, family, and continuity.
   Conclusion: Analyzing comments from actual patients at the end of a
   long-term relationship with an individual physician confirms beliefs of
   what patients consider important based on theoretical models, surveys,
   and interviews.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Caring is closely associated with reduced malpractice
   litigation, adherence to treatment and even symptom relief. Caring also
   is included in pay for performance formulas as well as widely utilized
   for quality improvement purposes. Our objective in this prospective
   qualitative study was to define caring behaviors associated with three
   challenging encounters: discussing the transition from curative to
   palliative care, delivering bad news (cancer), and discussing a medical
   error (misplaced test result). The purpose was to lay the groundwork for
   the creation of a `patient-centered' caring attitude checklist that
   could help the healthcare provider understand and ultimately enhance the
   patient's experience of care.
   Methods: Groups of randomly selected lay people, henceforth referred to
   as patients: (1) engaged in `think aloud' exercises to help create a
   15-item caring behavior checklist; (2) used the checklist to rate
   videotapes of simulated challenging encounters conducted by twenty
   primary care physicians (total of 600 ratings sets); and (3)
   participated in 12 separate 1.5 h focus groups discussing the caring
   (and non-caring) behaviors exhibited in videotapes of the highest and
   lowest rated encounters.
   Results: Thirteen behaviors emerged as focal for describing a doctor's
   caring attitude but with disagreement as to whether specific examples of
   these behaviors were `caring' or `uncaring.' For example, although the
   concept of empathic inquiry was considered important by most patients,
   the physician question, ``Is there someone you can call or talk with{''}
   (about a cancer diagnosis) was interpreted by one patient as `very
   caring' while-another was `impressed with how uncaring' the statement
   appeared.
   Conclusion: At the conceptual level there is a set of behaviors that
   represent caring, however, the manifestation of these behaviors is `in
   the eye of the beholder! The most important element of caring may not be
   the set of behaviors but a set of underlying abilities that include
   taking the patient's perspective and reflecting on the patient's
   responses.
   Practice implications: Medical education must focus on the underlying
   abilities of caring. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report how patient viewpoints on caring inform curriculum
   development for teaching sessions on delivering bad news, making the
   transition to palliative care, and communicating about a medical error.
   Methods: We conducted focus groups that used patients recruited from the
   surrounding community to view videotapes of physicians delivering bad
   news, talking with a patient about palliative care, and communicating
   about a medical error. We used focus group results, combined with
   evidence from the medical literature to inform curriculum content for
   workshops conducted with Internal Medicine and Family Medicine residents
   at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
   Results: Patient perspectives on caring gathered through focus groups
   differed in significant ways from the existing medical literature on
   caring when providers are communicating in the challenging situations
   that were depicted. Our data pointed out that individual reactions were
   unique and sometimes contradictory in that one person saw behavior as
   caring that others thought was uncaring. Participants often used
   qualifiers in their comments like ``appropriate{''} amounts of
   information, ``measured{''} empathy, chooses words carefully to reflect
   the relative nature of caring. ``Arranges to meet healthcare needs,{''}
   an issue that extends beyond the encounter, was seen as a new component
   of caring not previously described. Applying these concepts to
   curriculum required that we not only focus on the behavioral skills
   involved in these tasks, but also the processes of assessing patient's
   informational and emotional needs, and then taking steps to meet them,
   while adjusting behavior in real time to meet patients needs for caring.
   Workshops delivered were highly evaluated by residents.
   Conclusion: Patient perspectives on caring when providers deliver bad
   news, discuss transitions to palliative care, and communicate about a
   medical error reinforce that patient expectations for caring are highly
   contextualized and physician behavior needs to be individualized. We
   taught residents not only behavioral skills, but also the process skills
   of anticipating patient reactions, recognizing patient clues, planning
   and choosing effective strategies on the fly, and assessing one's own
   performance characteristic of communication expertise. Practice
   implications: Teaching caring attitudes with challenging communication
   tasks requires that learners appreciate and value not only caring
   behaviors but also learn the process by which they must adjust and
   titrate their actions to meet patient needs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{As the ``passion that animates authentic Professionalism,{''} humanism
   must be infused into medical education and clinical care as a central
   feature of medicine's Professionalism movement. In this article, we
   discuss a Current definition of humanism in medicine. We will also
   Provide detailed descriptions of educational programs intended to
   promote humanism at a number of medical schools in the United States
   (and beyond) and identify the key factors that make these programs
   effective. Common elements of programs that effectively teach humanism
   include: (1) opportunities for students to gain perspective in the lives
   of patients: (2) structured time for reflection on those experiences;
   and (3) focused mentoring to ensure that these experiences that both
   promote and sustain humanism in doctors, we hope to stimulate the
   thinking of other medical educators and to disseminate the impact of
   these innovative educational programs to help the profession meet its
   obligation to provide the public with humanistic physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Background. There has been little research into poetry-based medical
   education. Few studies consider learners' perceptions in depth.
   Objective. To explore general practice registrars' (GPRs) perceptions of
   two poetry-based sessions.
   Methods. GPRs in one general practice vocational training scheme
   experienced two poetry sessions. In one, the facilitator selected poems;
   in the other, poems were chosen by registrars. Poems were read and
   discussed, with emphasis on personal response. Data were obtained
   through in-depth semi-structured interviews with six registrars.
   Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using
   interpretative phenomenological analysis. Identification of individual
   ideas and shared themes enabled exploration of the registrars'
   experiences.
   Results. Registrars described how poetry helped them explore emotional
   territory. They recognized a broadening of education, describing how
   poems helped them consider different points of view, increasing their
   understanding of others. Vicarious experience, development of empathy
   and self-discovery were also reported. Participants speculated on how
   this might impact on patient care and professional practice.
   Facilitator-selected poems provided variety and ambiguity, provoking
   discussions with clinical relevance. Learner-selected poems enabled
   involvement, self-revelation and understanding of peers and developed
   emotional expression.
   Conclusions. These registrars reported difficulties expressing feelings
   in the culture of science-based medical training. Poetry sessions may
   provide an environment for emotional exploration, which could broaden
   understanding of self and others. Poetry-based education may develop
   emotional competence. The participants recognized development of key
   skills including close reading, attentive listening and interpretation
   of meaning. These skills may help doctors to understand individual
   patient's unique experience of illness, encouraging personalized care
   that respects patients' perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined pain and distress from needles in children
   undergoing blood sampling as a function of adult-child interaction and
   type of venous access (i.e., central external venous lines, internalized
   ports, or peripheral access via venipuncture). Participants were 55
   pediatric oncology patients, aged 3-18years, who were undergoing routine
   blood work. Pain ratings were obtained using the Faces Pain
   Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and conversation during the procedure was audio
   taped for coding using the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction
   Scale-Revised (CAMPIS-R). Childrens ratings of pain using the FPS-R were
   similar in the port (M = 2.57/10, standard deviation {[}SD] = 3.46) and
   peripheral (M = 2.56/10, SD = 3.24) groups, despite the fact that most
   children with internal ports were given a topical anesthetic. Similarly,
   there were no differences between port and peripheral groups in rates of
   child coping or distress, or parent and nurse observations of child
   pain. As would be expected, external line access was not associated with
   pain or distress, even among very young children, suggesting that they
   appropriately understood the pain rating scale. Results of the
   transcribed CAMPIS-R data indicate that the influences in adult-child
   interaction (ire bidirectional. Support was found for the
   well-established positive relationship between child. distress and adult
   reassurance and empathy. Implications for intervention and selection of
   central venous access devices are discussed.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{806-812}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patient-centered communication (PCC) is associated with more
   appropriate treatment of depression in primary care. Aside from patient
   presentation, little is known about other influences on PCC. We
   investigated whether PCC is influenced by personality dispositions of
   primary care providers, independent of patient presentation.
   Methods: Forty-six primary care providers completed personality scales
   from the NEO-Personality Inventory, revised and provided care to 88
   standardized patients presenting with either major depression or
   adjustment disorder with comorbid musculoskeletal symptoms, either
   making or not making a medication request. Coders scored each visit
   using the measure of PCC, assessing physicians' ability to explore the
   patient's illness experience (component 1), understand the patient's
   psychosocial context (component 2), and involve the patient in
   collaborative discussions of treatment (component 3).
   Results: Adjusting for physician demographics, training, and patient
   presentation, physicians who were more open to feelings explored the
   patient's experience of illness more (P = 0.05). More dutiful, or
   rule-bound physicians engaged in greater exploration of the patient's
   psychosocial and life circumstances (P = 0.04), but involved the patient
   less in treatment discussions (P = 0.03). Physicians reporting more
   anxious vulnerability also involved the patient less (P = 0.03).
   Physician demographics, training, and patient presentation explained
   4-7\% of variance in the measure of patient-centered communication
   components, with personality explaining an additional 4-7\% of the
   variance.
   Conclusions: Understanding of personality dispositions that promote or
   detract from PCC may help medical educators better identify trainees of
   varying aptitude, facilitate medical career counseling, and address
   individual training needs in a tailored fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Previous studies about resident well-being have focused on
   negative aspects of well-being. We conducted this study to explore
   residents' conceptions of well-being and how it affects their work.
   Methods: One investigator conducted semi-structured interviews with
   residents at two hospitals during February-June 2005. Through random
   sampling stratified by program and gender, we invited 49 residents from
   internal medicine, psychiatry, surgery, emergency medicine, anesthesia,
   obstetrics/gynecology, and pediatrics. Using an editing analysis style,
   three investigators independently coded transcripts.
   Results: 26 residents participated in 45-min interviews. Residents
   acknowledged that well-being affected four elements of their work:
   relationships with patients, interactions with colleagues, performance,
   and motivation. Residents described higher quality discussions with
   patients when their well-being was high and inappropriate exchanges when
   well-being was low. Residents attributed conflict with colleagues to C,
   9 lower states of well-being. Residents felt they had improved
   decision-making when their well-being was higher. Residents' motivation
   in their daily work and career varied with fluctuating well-being. Five
   residents initially denied that their well-being affects their work,
   voicing concerns that this would be unprofessional.
   Conclusions: Most residents felt that both high and low levels of
   well-being affected their work, particularly their work relationships.
   Practice implications: The educational and patient care goals of
   residency training may be enhanced through interventions that promote
   resident well-being. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Communication is a key competence for medical and nursing health care
   providers alike. However, there appear to be areas of
   ``speechlessness{''} regarding specific medical problems, including the
   ``taboo{''} disease incontinence. There is a lack of scientific data
   regarding incontinence in the context of communication among patients
   and health care professionals.
   The descriptive study was designed to provide insights how female and
   male patients alike perceive communications about incontinence with
   doctors and nurses, respectively. 22 structured interviews were
   conducted and taped with 16 elderly female and 6 male patients (age >=
   60 years, mean: 81 years, demented patients excluded, n = 19
   analysable), and five interviews each with doctors and nurses within the
   setting of a rehabilitation hospital for geriatric patients (not
   reported here). We used published methodology to interpret the diversity
   of patients' verbal communications to the female interviewer.
   Results suggest that patients wish to find a relationship based on
   sympathy, empathy and trust. If incontinence is addressed, it is by
   doctors, not patients. Statements by patients suggest that they
   differentiate between expectations addressing the professional level of
   medical care, and a level perhaps best described as the quality of the
   personal relationship between the patient and doctor. However, these
   twofold expectations were not distinguishable regarding nursing
   professionals, they were perceived on a ``personal care level{''} only,
   not the professional level regarding incontinence. Independent of
   professional affiliation, patients expect empathy, understanding, and
   respect. They selectively criticize manners of (some) nurses and lack of
   understandable transfer of information by doctors. The gender of the
   care providers was not an issue for patients regarding communication
   about incontinence. The preliminary results show that there is room for
   improvement for better communication regarding incontinence. However,
   areas affected appear to differ between nursing and medical
   professionals.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently little knowledge or understanding of medical
   students' knowledge and attitudes toward the poor. Teaching hospitals
   bring students face-to-face with poor and uninsured patients on a
   regular basis. However, an overview of the research available suggests
   that this contact does not result in students' greater understanding and
   empathy for the plight of the poor and may, in fact, lead to an erosion
   of positive attitudes toward the poor. A basic understanding of justice
   suggests that as the poor are disproportionately the subjects of medical
   training, this population should enjoy a proportionate benefit for this
   service. Furthermore, medicine's social contract with the public is
   often thought to include an ideal of service to the underserved and a
   duty to help educate the general public regarding the health needs of
   our nation.
   In their discussion, the authors situate medical students' attitudes
   toward the poor within larger cultural perspectives, including attitudes
   toward the poor and attributions for poverty. They provide three
   suggestions for improving trainees' knowledge of and attitudes toward
   the poor-namely, increasing the socioeconomic diversity of students,
   promoting empathy through curricular efforts, and focusing more directly
   on role modeling. The authors argue that service learning, especially
   efforts that include gaining detailed knowledge of a particular person
   or persons, coupled with critical reflection, presents a very promising
   direction toward achieving these goals. Finally, they posit an agenda
   for future educational research that might contribute to the increased
   efficacy of medical education in this important formative domain.}},

Abstract = {{The use of narratives, including physicians' and patients' stories,
   literature, and film, is increasingly popular in medical education.
   There is, however, a need for an overarching conceptual framework to
   guide these efforts, which are often dismissed as ``soft{''} and placed
   at the margins of medical school curricula. The purpose of this article
   is to describe the conceptual basis for an approach to patient-centered
   medical education and narrative medicine initiated at the University of
   Micnigan Medical School in the fall of 2003. This approach, the Family
   Centered Experience, involves home visits and conversations between
   beginning medical students and patient volunteers and their families and
   is aimed at fostering humanism in medicine. The program incorporates
   developmental and learning theory, longitudinal interactions with
   individuals with chronic illness, reflective learning, and small-group
   discussions to explore the experience of illness and its care. The
   author describes a grounding of this approach in theories of empathy and
   moral development and clarifies the educational value that narratives
   bring to medical education. Specific pedagogical considerations,
   including use of activities to create ``cognitive disequilibrium{''} and
   the concept of transformative learning, are also discussed and may be
   applied to narrative medicine, professionalism, multicultural education,
   medical ethics, and other subject areas in medical education that
   address individuals and their health care needs in society.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Medical educators act on the belief that students benefit
   from formal and informal educational experiences that foster virtues
   such as compassion, altruism, and respect for patients.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine fourth year medical
   students' perspectives on how, where, and by whom they believe the
   virtues associated with good physicianhood have been taught to them.
   DESIGN: Fourth year students were assigned a two- to three-page essay
   that asked them to reflect on how their medical education had ``fostered
   and hindered{''} their conceptions of compassion, altruism, and respect
   for patients.
   PARTICIPANTS: All 112 students completed this assignment, and 52 (46\%)
   gave us permission to use their essays for this study.
   APPROACH: An inductive, qualitative approach was used to develop themes
   derived from students' essays.
   RESULTS: Students' thoughts were organized around the idea of influences
   in three areas to which they consistently referred. Foundational
   influences included parents and ``formative years,{''} religious faith,
   and other experiences preceding medical school. Preclinical education
   influences comprised formal classroom experiences (both positive and
   negative effects). Clinical education influences included role modeling
   (both positive and negative) and the clinical environment (notable for
   emphasis on efficiency and conflicting cues). Students' essays drew most
   heavily on the effects of role modeling.
   DISCUSSION: Medical students arrive at our doors as thoughtful,
   compassionate people. Positive role models and activities to promote
   critical self-reflection may help nurture these attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine medical students' experiences with
   medical errors.
   METHODS In 2001 and 2002, 172 fourth-year medical students wrote an
   anonymous description of a significant medical error they had witnessed
   or committed during their clinical clerkships. The assignment
   represented part of a required medical ethics course. We analysed 147 of
   these essays using thematic content analysis.
   RESULTS Many medical students made or observed significant errors. In
   either situation, some students experienced distress that seemingly went
   unaddressed. Furthermore, this distress was sometimes severe and
   persisted after the initial event. Some students also experienced
   considerable uncertainty as to whether an error had occurred and how to
   prevent future errors. Many errors may not have been disclosed to
   patients, and some students who desired to discuss or disclose errors
   were apparently discouraged from doing so by senior doctors. Some
   students criticised senior doctors who attempted to hide errors or avoid
   responsibility. By contrast, students who witnessed senior doctors take
   responsibility for errors and candidly disclose errors to patients
   appeared to recognise the importance of honesty and integrity and said
   they aspired to these standards.
   CONCLUSIONS There are many missed opportunities to teach students how to
   respond to and learn from errors. Some faculty members and housestaff
   may at times respond to errors in ways that appear to contradict
   professional standards. Medical educators should increase exposure to
   exemplary responses to errors and help students to learn from and cope
   with errors.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this systematic review was to examine studies that have
   investigated sustaining hope during prognostic and end-of-life issues
   discussions with terminally ill patients and their families. A
   comprehensive search of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and handsearching, from
   1985 to June 2006, identified 27 studies.
   This review suggests that the issues surrounding hope in this context
   are complex. Despite the lack of unanimity among researchers regarding
   the definition of hope, findings suggest that balancing hope with
   honesty is an important skill for health professionals (HPs). Many
   patients seem to be able to maintain a sense of hope despite
   acknowledging the terminal nature of their illness. Patients and
   caregivers mostly preferred honest and accurate information, provided
   with empathy and understanding. Many different sources of hope were
   identified in this context in broad aspects of life, not just the
   medical situation. HPs need to recognize this spectrum of hope and
   appreciate that patients may simultaneously hope for `cure' while
   acknowledging the terminal nature of their illness. HPs may help
   patients to cope with their terminal prognosis by xploring and fostering
   realistic forms of hope that are meaningful for the particular patient
   and their family. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ability to recognize and adapt to affective states in
   one's self and others, emotional intelligence is thought to connote
   effective, compassionate doctor-patient communication. Unfortunately,
   medical training has been shown to erode some of the very attributes it
   purports to instill in students. Purpose: The objective is to examine
   changes in students' emotional intelligence and empathy across an
   undergraduate medical curriculum. Methods: During M1 orientation and
   again following M3 clerkship training, students in the University of
   Kentucky College of Medicine Class of 2004 completed the Trait Meta-Mood
   Scale (TMMS) and Davis' Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Baseline
   changes in specific dimensions were examined for both male and female
   students. Results: Reliability of subscales was generally acceptable
   (alpha >= .70). Sixty-four students provided data at both time points.
   Compared to baseline, two of three TMMS dimensions-attention to feelings
   and mood repair-were significantly (p <= .05) lower at follow-up. One
   IRI dimension-empathic concern-was also significantly lower at Time 2,
   whereas another, Personal Distress, was significantly higher. However,
   differences generally reflected only small effect sizes. No significant
   gender interactions were noted. Conclusions: Despite quite modest effect
   sizes, findings suggest that students' abilities to effectively manage
   affective states may be subject to some minor fluctuation across the
   undergraduate educational continuum. However, whether these observed
   declines constitute meaningful, clinically relevant changes remains
   unclear.}},

Title = {{The role of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in Germany - A
   focus group study of GPs}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: There has been a marked increase in the use of complementary
   and alternative medicine (CAM) in recent years worldwide. In Germany,
   apart from `Heilpraktiker' (= state-licensed, non-medical CAM
   practitioners), some general practitioners (GPs) provide CAM in their
   practices. This paper aims to explore the attitudes of GPs about the
   role of CAM in Germany, in relation to the healthcare system, quality of
   care, medical education and research. Furthermore, experiences of GPs
   integrating CAM in their daily practice were explored.
   Methods: Using a qualitative methodological approach 3 focus groups with
   a convenience sample of 17 GPs were conducted. The discussions were
   transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: The majority of the participating GPs had integrated one or
   more CAM therapies into their every-day practice. Four key themes were
   identified based on the topics covered in the focus groups: the role of
   CAM within the German healthcare system, quality of care, education and
   research. Within the theme `role of CAM within the healthcare system'
   there were five categories: integration of CAM, CAM in the Statutory
   Health Insurance, modernisation of the Statutory Health Insurance Act,
   individual healthcare services and `Heilpraktiker'. Regarding quality of
   care there were two broad groups of GPs: those who thought patients
   would benefit from standardizing CAM and those who feared that quality
   control would interfere with the individual approach of CAM. The main
   issues identified relating to research and education were the need for
   the development of alternative research strategies and the low quality
   of existing CAM education respectively.
   Conclusion: The majority of the participating GPs considered CAM as a
   reasonable complementary approach within primary care. The study
   increased our understanding of GPs attitudes about the role of CAM
   within the German healthcare system and the use of `Heilpraktiker' as a
   competing CAM-provider. It seems to be a need for increased funding for
   research, better education and remuneration by the Statutory Health
   Insurance in order to improve access to `Integrative medicine' in
   Germany.}},

Abstract = {{Background: BATHE is an acronym for Background, Affect, Trouble,
   Handling, and Empathy and refers to specific questions or comments
   incorporated into a standard medical interview. The BATHE technique was
   developed as a rapid psychosocial intervention for the assessment of
   psychological factors that may contribute to patients' physical
   complaints. The present research was designed to determine whether the
   use of BATHE significantly increased patient satisfaction during a visit
   to a family physician. Methods: Four family physicians in a busy urban
   family practice center were involved in the study. Two physicians were
   instructed to use the BATHE protocols until data had been collected from
   10 patients and then to proceed in their usual fashion with their next
   10 patients. The other two physicians conducted their interview as usual
   with their first 10 patients and then used BATHE with the following 10
   patients. All patients were asked to complete a satisfaction survey
   following their consultation. Results: BATHEd patients responded with
   significantly higher ratings for 8 of the 11 satisfaction measures,
   including those related to information provided, perception of physician
   concern, and likelihood of recommending the physician to others.
   Conclusions: The results of this pilot study support the use of BATHE
   with primary care patients, as it increases patient satisfaction,
   possibly by helping patients sense that their physician is sympathetic
   and concerned.}},

Title = {{Beneficial effects of hypnosis and adverse effects of empathic attention
   during percutaneous tumor treatment: When being nice does not suffice}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine how hypnosis and empathic attention during
   percutaneous tumor treatments affect pain, anxiety, drug use, and
   adverse events.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: For their tumor embolization or radiofrequency
   ablation, 201 patients were randomized to receive standard care,
   empathic attention with defined behaviors displayed by an additional
   provider, or self-hypnotic relaxation including the defined empathic
   attention behaviors. All had local anesthesia and access to intravenous
   medication. Main outcome measures were pain and anxiety assessed every
   15 minutes by patient self-report, medication use (with 50 mu g fentanyl
   or 1 mg midazolam counted as one unit), and adverse events, defined as
   occurrences requiring extra medical attention, including systolic blood
   pressure fluctuations (>= 50 mm Hg change to > 180 mm Hg or < 105 mm
   Hg), vasovagal episodes, cardiac events, and respiratory impairment.
   RESULTS: Patients treated with hypnosis experienced significantly less
   pain and anxiety than those in the standard care and empathy groups at
   several time intervals and received significantly fewer median drug
   units (mean, 2.0; interquartile range {[}IQR], 1-4) than patients in the
   standard (mean, 3.0; IQR, 1.5-5.0; P = .0147) and empathy groups (mean,
   3.50, IQR, 2.0-5.9; P =.0026). Thirty-one of 65 patients (48\%) in the
   empathy group had adverse events, which was significantly more than in
   the hypnosis group (eight of 66; 12\%; P = .0001) and standard care
   group (18 of 70; 26\%; P = .0118).
   CONCLUSIONS: Procedural hypnosis including empathic attention reduces
   pain, anxiety, and medication use. Conversely, empathic approaches
   without hypnosis that provide an external focus of attention and do not
   enhance patients' self-coping can result in more adverse events. These
   findings should have major implications in the education of procedural
   personnel.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To promote monthly interpersonal skill communication
   role-play and coaching for front-office staff.
   Method: For 15 min a month, during staff meetings, healthcare staff such
   as receptionists and medical assistants should participate in
   communication skill coaching. Participants should discuss a recurring
   communication challenge (e.g., patients irritated by repeated requests
   for health histories), role-play options for communication, and receive
   feedback.
   Result: Interpersonal communication skills such as acknowledging the
   concerns of others are acquired slowly. Repeated practice and supportive
   feedback increase the likelihood that these skills will be valued and
   mastered.
   Conclusion: Research shows communication skills develop when they are
   modeled and role-played frequently and are less likely to develop with
   occasional interventions.
   Practice implication: Health care professionals should devote time to
   role-playing interaction with patients for brief intervals at least
   monthly. Staff should give one another feedback on the best options for
   managing challenging communication situations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Standardized patient simulations have been used as an assessment tool,
   providing teachers an opportunity to observe learner clinical and
   communication skills while eliminating the fear of harm to patients. Yet
   the vices and virtues of these simulations in measuring clinical and
   communication skills have been deliberated. Based on our standardized
   patient examination experience, we believe standardized patient
   simulations can be used to assess certain forms of learners' empathic
   behaviors. We advocate that, in properly designed and conducted
   simulations, the scores and feedback comments from standardized patients
   to learners regarding their empathic behaviors can identify learners
   with important deficiencies. We conclude our discussion by recommending
   that reflective practice, challenging cases, decision moments, and
   raters training to provide feedback can supplement and enrich the use of
   standardized patient simulations in evaluating empathy. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{The use of simulation and standardized patients in medical education is
   firmly established. In this ``point-counterpoint{''} format we debate
   not their important function but the extent to which they are used to
   establish ``evidence{''} for trainees' empathic communication skills
   beyond their surface manifestations. We also question such issues as the
   power dynamics implicit in simulation when patients are not really
   worried or dependent but rather students who are under the evaluative
   surveillance gaze, often relying on formulaic and superficial behaviors
   associated with good communication.
   We offer educative experiences in narrative domains as opportunities to
   develop the habits of thinking and authentic feeling often absent in
   evaluative-based simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{There has been a call to include empathy as a selection criterion in
   medical training.
   Empathy is a complex construct currently assessed by self-rating and
   observational scales, which may be complicated by the subjectivity of
   such measurements.
   Neuroscientific research into disorders of empathy such as autism should
   be encouraged to help further refine the evolving construct of empathy.
   Empathy may be more common in females, and selection for higher empathy
   may discriminate against males unless sex-specific adjustments are
   included in selection criteria.
   Physician empathy may lead to greater patient satisfaction and
   confidence in physicians, but more evidence is needed to support links
   to physician competence. In contrast, academic performance and
   conscientiousness have been clearly linked to physician competence.
   Competence and empathy may be independent qualities developed by
   different aspects of medical training.
   Provision of better work conditions and environments for physicians may
   forestall erosion of empathy, reducing the need to predict and enhance
   its development.
   Empathy should be valued in medical students and doctors, but more
   research is needed into the nature, assessment, and correlates of
   empathy before its adoption as a selection criterion for medical
   students.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a provider attribute that has been a topic of increased
   clinical interest, particularly as it relates to pain. This article
   examines various dimensions of the pain and empathy literature:
   definitions of empathy, research regarding the psychophysiology of
   empathy for pain, and research related to empathy in psychological and
   medical care. Research regarding topics broadly related to empathy is
   also reviewed, including communication skills and patient-centered care.
   Although this literature supports the clinical value of provider empathy
   and/or behaviors likely to reflect empathy, little research has
   explicitly examined empathy in the treatment of pain. Nonetheless, when
   considered in the broader context, the evidence is sufficient to draw
   some conclusions regarding approaches to pain care that are likely to
   reflect and/or elicit provider empathy and are central to effective pain
   management.}},

Title = {{Does the presence of medical students affect quality in general practice
   consultations?}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{374-381}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT Previous studies have suggested that the patient's experience of
   a consultation with a doctor is not affected by the presence of medical
   students. However, no study has looked at the effect of student presence
   on conventional UK general practice consultations.
   OBJECTIVES This study aimed to measure the quality of the consultation
   as experienced by patients when students are present, to explore
   patients' attitudes to the presence of medical students, and to look at
   the relationships between these factors.
   METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire study in general
   practices in north-east England. General practitioners (GPs) from
   practices teaching fourth and final year students administered
   questionnaires to patients who were seen in either teaching or
   non-teaching consultations. The questionnaire comprised previously
   validated measures of empathy and enablement as measures of quality,
   attitudinal statements regarding the presence of students, a scale
   rating pertaining to the patient's degree of acquaintance with the
   doctor, and items on demographic data.
   RESULTS Results showed no significant differences in enablement scores
   between the 2 groups. Consultations with student presence last longer.
   Empathy scores were significantly lower in the `student present' group,
   but the size of the difference was small. Attitudinal statements
   regarding the presence of students showed a high proportion of positive
   responses, and some groupings of negative ones. Further analysis
   demonstrated some significant links between attitudinal statements and
   enablement and empathy scores.
   CONCLUSIONS The quality of general practice consultations was not
   adversely affected by medical student presence. However, significant
   numbers of patients who agreed to be seen with a student present were
   resistant to the student's presence.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To examine factors affecting the length of hospital stay
   (LOS) of patients referred to psychiatric consultation liaison (C-L)
   services.
   Methods: The study sample prospectively included all the referrals in
   2004 to the C-L psychiatry unit at King Khaled University Hospital in
   Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The following factors were documented
   for each consultation: patient demographic characteristics, dates of
   admission, consultation, and discharge, and total days of stay, medical
   specialty service requesting the consultation, reason for referral given
   by the referring physician, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders DSM-IV diagnosis, based on the consultation interview.
   Results: The total number of referrals was 264. The LOS showed positive
   correlation with referral time (p=0.0001) accounting for 22\% of the
   variance in LOS. Surgical ward admission and diagnosis of delirium
   predicted longer LOS, while obstetric/gynecology ward admission,
   diagnosis of anxiety, and diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder
   predicted shorter LOS.
   Conclusion: The direct correlation between the timing of referral and
   LOS reinforces that it is important for medical professionals to
   identify and detect patients who require early psychiatric intervention.
   Ways of detecting high-risk patients are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hip and tech-savvy medical students and junior doctors are
   likely to find lecture-based professionalism and ethics modules boring.
   Medical-based television dramas and films, on the other hand, are
   exciting and topical, and often feature real-life situations, albeit
   presented with artistic license. Current ``hot{''} television series,
   such as House, ER, and Grey's Anatomy, feature scenarios which are
   thought-provoking, not only for the fascinating cases featured, but also
   for the ethical dilemmas and professionalism issues which present
   themselves. Summary: We discuss the educational merits of the genre of
   the medical drama and propose to develop an ``In-House{''} Medical
   Education Initiative, in which an episode of House is shown, and
   participants encouraged, at the end of the screening, to discuss the
   following: ethics, professionalism (communications skills,
   confidentiality, sensitivity, and empathy), history taking and clinical
   examination, diagnostic steps and missteps, and finally learning points
   (or take-home messages). Conclusion: Television programs, purported to
   ``rot the mind,{''} can actually be put to good use in the teaching of
   ``soft skills{''} in medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To determine whether vicarious empathy (i.e., to have a visceral
   empathic response, versus role-playing empathy) decreases, and whether
   students choosing specialties with greater patient contact maintain
   vicarious empathy better than do students choosing specialties with less
   patient contact.
   Method
   The Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale was administered at the beginning
   of each academic year at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
   for four classes, 2001-2004. Students also reported their gender and
   specialty choice. Specialty choice was classified as core (internal
   medicine, family medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, and
   psychiatry) or noncore (all other specialties).
   Results
   Vicarious empathy significantly decreased during medical education (P
   <.001), especially after the first and third years. Students choosing
   core careers had higher empathy than did those choosing noncore careers.
   Men choosing core careers initially had empathy exceeding population
   norms, but their empathy fell to be comparable with that of norms by the
   end of their third year. The empathy of men choosing noncore careers was
   comparable with that of norms, Women choosing core careers had empathy
   scores comparable with those of norms, but the scores of women choosing
   noncore careers fell below those of the norms by their second year.
   Conclusions
   The findings suggest that undergraduate medical education may be a major
   determinant differentially affecting the vicarious empathy of students
   on the basis of gender and/or specialty choice. The greatest impact
   occurred in men who chose noncore specialties. The significant decrease
   in vicarious empathy is of concern, because empathy is crucial for a
   successful physician-patient relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Medical students must be prepared for working in inter-professional and
   multi-disciplinary clinical teams centred on a patient's care pathway.
   While there has been a good deal of rhetoric surrounding patient-centred
   medical education, there has been little attempt to conceptualise such a
   practice beyond the level of describing education of communication
   skills and empathy within a broad `professionalism' framework.
   Paradoxically, while aiming to strengthen patient-student interactions,
   this approach tends to refocus on the role modelling of the physician,
   and opportunities for potentially deep collaborative working
   relationships between students and patients are missed. A radical
   overhaul of conventional doctor-led medical education may be necessary,
   that also challenges the orthodoxies of individualistic student-centred
   approaches, leading to an authentic patient-centred model that shifts
   the locus of learning from the relationship between doctor as educator
   and student to the relationship between patient and student, with expert
   doctor as resource. Drawing on contemporary poststructuralist theory of
   text and identity construction, and on innovative models of work-based
   learning, the potential quality of relationship between student and
   patient is articulated in terms of collaborative knowledge production,
   involving close reading with the patient as text, through dialogue.
   Here, a medical `education' displaces traditional forms of medical
   `training' that typically involve individual information reproduction.
   Students may, paradoxically, improve clinical acumen through
   consideration of silences, gaps, and contradictions in patients as
   texts, rather than treating communication as transparent. Such
   paradoxical effects have been systematically occluded or denied in
   traditional medical education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the prevalence of depression and burnout among
   residents in paediatrics and to establish if a relation exists between
   these disorders and medication errors.
   Design Prospective cohort study.
   Setting Three urban freestanding children's hospitals in the United
   States.
   Participants 123 residents in three paediatric residency programmes.
   Main outcome measures Prevalence of depression using the Harvard
   national depression screening day scale, burnout using the Maslach
   burnout inventory, and rate of medication errors per resident month.
   Results 24 (20\%) of the participating residents met the criteria for
   depression and 92 (74\%) met the criteria for burnout. Active
   surveillance yielded 45 errors made by participants. Depressed residents
   made 6.2 times as many medication errors per resident month as residents
   who were not depressed: 1.55 (95\% confidence interval 0.57 to 4.22)
   compared with 0.25 (0.14 to 0.46, P<0.001). Burnt out residents and
   non-burnt out residents made similar rates of errors per resident month:
   0.45 (0.20 to 0.98) compared with 0.53 (0.21 to 1.33, P=0.2).
   Conclusions Depression and burnout are major problems among residents in
   paediatrics. Depressed residents made significantly more medical errors
   than their non-depressed peers; however, burnout did not seem to
   correlate with an increased rate of medical errors.}},

Title = {{Talking matters: Abused women's views on disclosure of partner abuse to
   the family doctor and its role in handling the abuse situation}},
Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed to explore what women valued most in disclosing
   partner abuse to their doctor and whether disclosure played a role in
   handling their abuse situation.
   Methods: A qualitative method was used to understand abused women's
   views and experiences with disclosure to their family doctor. Thirty-six
   women were interviewed within 4 weeks after disclosure to their family
   doctor.
   Results: Most women went to see the doctor for some medical complaint,
   and only three women planned to disclose the abuse. Twenty-five women
   valued most their doctor's communicative approach with empathy or
   empowering and nine women valued most the instrumental approach. Eight
   women of the latter group wanted this combined with a communicative
   approach. After disclosure to the family doctor, a group of women (n =
   20) perceived a real change in their possibilities to handle their
   situation. They appeared to be in a position we named: `in transition',
   a state in which they started or continued a process of change. Another
   group of women (n = 13) appeared to be in a `locked-up' position, a
   state without any prospect on change, feeling out of control and fearing
   the abuser. Three women reacted reserved towards change.
   Conclusion: A communicative approach, providing empathy and empowerment,
   is important to women in disclosing partner abuse. More than half of the
   women perceived possibilities for a change.
   Practice implications: Talking about abuse is an important step in a
   woman's process of change. Doctors should acknowledge the advantage of
   their position as a professional confidant and ask women about abuse.

Abstract = {{Background: Due to technical advances and progressive specialization,
   patient physician relationship evolved from being based on confidence
   and comprehension to be impersonal and contractual. Aim: To evaluate the
   change produced in medical students' concept of the meaning of disease,
   afer living an experience of accompanying a patient and their family
   environment. Material and methods: We used a qualitative research
   methodology based on participative-action to evaluate an educational
   method in which a group of third year medical students accompanied a
   previously selected chronic patient during two months. We performed two
   focal groups, one previous to the experience and the second one a month
   later. Additionally, every student wrote a personal narration of the
   experience. We compared the students' perception of the meaning of
   disease for the patients and their relatives, before and after the
   experience. Results: The students confirmed their previous conception
   about chronic disease, but they also discovered the ways in which some
   patients and their families overcome their limitations. They pointed out
   their belief that the physician's comprehension of the meaning of
   disease for the patient and the family, a need to practice a good
   medicine and that this knowledge change the physician-patient
   relationship. Conclusions: This experience was an effective way of
   learning the meaning of disease, which might be a part of medical
   student' training, with the corresponding adjustments and changes.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural competence in oncology requires the acquisition of specific
   knowledge, clinical skills, and attitudes that facilitate effective
   cross-cultural negotiation in the clinical setting, thus, leading to
   improved therapeutic outcomes and decreased disparities in cancer care.
   Cultural competence in oncology entails a basic knowledge of different
   cultural attitudes and practices of communication of the truth and of
   decision-making styles throughout the world. Cultural competence always
   presupposes oncology professionals' awareness of their own cultural
   beliefs and values. To be able to communicate with cancer patients in
   culturally sensitive ways, oncologists should have knowledge of the
   concept of culture in its complexity and of the risks of racism,
   classism, sexism, ageism, and stereotyping that must be avoided in
   clinical practice. Oncologists should develop a sense of appreciation
   for differences in health care values, based on the recognition that no
   culture can claim hegemony over others and that cultures are evolving
   under their reciprocal influence on each other. Medical schools and
   oncology training can teach communication skills and cultural
   competence, while fostering in all students and young doctors those
   attitudes of humility, empathy, curiosity, respect, sensitivity, and
   awareness that are needed to deliver effective and culturally sensitive
   cancer care.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of obesity is increasing in both developed and developing
   countries, with rates reaching similar to 10-35\%, among adults in the
   Euro-American region. Obesity is associated with increased risks of
   cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and some type of
   cancers. Obesity significantly affects the quality of life and reduces
   the average life expectancy. The effective treatment of obesity should
   address both the medical and the social burden of this disease. Obesity
   needs to he treated within the health care system as any other complex
   disease, with empathy and Without prejudice. Both health care providers
   and patient,; should know that the obesity treatment is a lifelong task.
   They should also Set realistic goals before starting the treatment,
   whereas keeping in mind that even a modest weight loss of 5-15\%
   significantly reduces obesity-related health risks. Essential treatment
   of obesity includes low-calorie low-fat diets, increased physical
   activity, and strategies contributing to the modification of lifestyle.
   Anti-obesity drugs facilitate weight loss and contribute to further
   amelioration of obesity-related health risks. A short-term weight loss,
   up to 6 months, is usually achieved easily. However, the long-term
   weight management is often associated with a lack of compliance,
   failures, and a high dropout rate. Regular physical activity, cognitive
   behavioral modification of lifestyle, and administration of anti-obesity
   drugs improve weight loss maintenance. Bariatric surgery is an effective
   strategy to treat severely obese patients. Bariatric surgery leads to a
   substantial improvement of comorbidities as well as to a reduction in
   overall mortality by 25-50\% during the long-term follow-up. Obesity
   treatment should be individually tailored and the. following factors
   should be taken into account: sex, the degree of obesity, individual
   health risks, psychobehavioral and metabolic characteristics, and the
   outcome of previous weight loss attempts. In the future, ail evaluation
   of hormonal and genetic determinants of weight loss could also
   contribute to a better choice of individual therapy for a particular
   obese patient. A multilevel obesity management network of mutually
   collaborating facilities should he established to provide individually
   tailored treatment. Centers of excellence in obesity management
   represented by multidisciplinary teams should provide comprehensive
   programs for the treatment of obesity derived from evidence-based
   medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Stigma is a barrier to mental health care access for patients with
   schizophrenia and can interfere with developing therapeutic
   relationships. This study demonstrates success of a voice simulation
   experience during orientation in changing the biases of nursing students
   and the effect on the development of the nurse-patient relationship.
   Ninety-four individuals participated; 52 received a voice simulation
   experience during orientation, and 42 received orientation with no voice
   simulation experience. The Medical Condition Regard Scale was
   administered before and after orientation. Posttest paired t test
   results show significant differences in attitudes toward patients with
   voice hearing experiences between the two groups. The themes of personal
   growth from. the focus groups postorientation include Affective
   Experience, Physical Experience, and Empathy. Findings demonstrate that
   the orientation process should include methods to challenge stereotyping
   and bias to decrease stigma, improve service access, and enhance the
   ability to develop therapeutic relationships.}},

   Honesty, confidence and sharing responsibility are the critical points

   the treatment process requires a strong patient-physician relationship.
   Accurate communication, evaluation of patients from the psychosocial
   point of view and analysis of patient's expectancy are effective in
   identifying the most proper relationship model for the patient. Problems
   that may appear in the relationship between cancer patient and physician
   originate from the patient, disease characteristics, physician's
   approach, and external factors such as deficiency of
   substructure-staff-equipment, extreme workload of the physician, poor
   hospital management and financial problems. Eradication of the external
   factors is related to the health policy of the state, but accurate
   communication must take part in the professional skills of the
   physician.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the impact of the Patient Empathy Modeling
   pedagogy on students' empathy towards caring for the underserved during
   an advanced pharmacy practice experience ( APPE).
   Design
   Pharmacy students completing an APPE at 2 primary care clinics
   participated in a Patient Empathy Modeling assignment for 10 days. Each
   student ``became the patient,{''} simulating the life of an actual
   patient with multiple chronic diseases who was coping with an economic,
   cultural, or communication barrier to optimal healthcare. Students
   completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy ( JSPE) before and
   after completing the assignment, and wrote daily journal entries and a
   reflection paper.
   Assessment
   Twenty-six students completed the PEM exercises from 2005-2006. Scores
   on the JSPE improved. Students' comments in journals and reflection
   papers revealed 3 major themes: greater appreciation of the difficulty
   patients have with adherence to medication and treatment regimens,
   increased empathy for patients from different backgrounds and patients
   with medical and psychosocial challenges, and improved ability to apply
   the lessons learned in the course to their patient care roles.
   Conclusion
   A Patient Empathy Modeling assignment improved pharmacy students'
   empathy toward underserved populations. Integrating the assignment
   within an APPE allowed students to immediately begin applying the
   knowledge and insight gained from the exercise.}},

Title = {{Quality gap of educational services in viewpoints of students in
   Hormozgan University of medical sciences}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Higher education is growing fast and every day it becomes
   more and more exposed to globalization processes. The aim of this study
   was to determine the quality gap of educational services by using a
   modified SERVQUAL instrument among students in Hormozgan University of
   Medical Sciences.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at Hormozgan University
   of Medical Sciences in 2007. In this study, a total of 300 students were
   selected randomly and asked to complete a questionnaire that was
   designed according to SERVQUAL methods. This questionnaire measured
   students' perceptions and expectations in five dimensions of service
   that consists of assurance, responsiveness, empathy, reliability and
   tangibles. The quality gap of educational services was determined based
   on differences between students' perceptions and expectations.
   Results: The results demonstrated that in each of the five SERVQUAL
   dimensions, there was a negative quality gap. The least and the most
   negative quality gap means were in the reliability (-0.71) and
   responsiveness (-1.14) dimensions respectively. Also, there were
   significant differences between perceptions and expectations of students
   in all of the five SERVQUAL dimensions ( p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Negative quality gaps mean students' expectations exceed
   their perceptions. Thus, improvements are needed across all five
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to examine parent-reported
   experiences in the health care system after receiving the prenatal
   diagnosis of trisomy 18 and to identify factors that contribute to
   satisfaction with care. Study Design: Nineteen families who received the
   diagnosis between 2002 and 2005 were given semistructured telephone
   interviews. Of the 19 families, 11 continued the pregnancy while the
   remaining 8 chose induced abortion. Classical content analysis was
   utilized to identify themes among subject responses. Result: We
   identified several specific aspects of care as key in either being
   highly satisfied or dissatisfied: expressions of empathy from provider,
   continuity of care, communication, valuing the fetus and participation
   in medical decision-making. Conclusions: Aspects of care that were
   identified as reasons for dissatisfaction are potentially modifiable by
   training, education or team-based approaches. Further studies are
   necessary to determine how we can improve the quality of services during
   prenatal diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT The implementation of an assessment system may be facilitated by
   stakeholder agreement that appropriate qualities are being tested. This
   study investigated the extent to which stakeholders perceived 8
   assessment formats (multiple-choice questions, objective structured
   clinical examination, video, significant event analysis, criterion
   audit, multi-source feedback, case analysis and patient satisfaction
   questionnaire) as able to assess varying qualities of doctors training
   in UK general practice.
   METHODS Educationalists, general practice trainers and registrars
   completed a blueprinting style of exercise to rate the extent to which
   each evaluation format was perceived to assess each of 8 competencies
   derived primarily from the General Medical Council document Good Medical
   Practice.
   RESULTS There were high levels of agreement among stakeholders regarding
   the perceived qualities tested by the proposed formats (G = 0.82-0.93).
   Differences were found in participants' perceptions of how well
   qualities were able to be assessed and in the ability of the respective
   formats to test each quality. Multi-source feedback (MSF) was expected
   to assess a wide range of qualities, whereas Probity, Health and Ability
   to work with colleagues were limited in terms of how well they could be
   tested by the proposed formats.
   DISCUSSION Awareness of the perceptions of stakeholders should
   facilitate the development and implementation of workplace-based
   assessment (WPBA) systems. These data shed light on the acceptability of
   various formats in a way that will inform further investigation of WPBA
   formats' validity and feasibility, while also providing evidence on
   which to base educational efforts regarding the value of each format.}},

   experiences}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{260-264}},
Abstract = {{Background: This article responds to repeated calls in the literature to
   teach medical students how to treat the whole patient, not just the
   disease. It focuses on the educational experiences of medical students
   in a Canadian university in an effort to clarify the determinants of
   caring in medical education.
   Method: Nineteen (19) second-year medical students volunteered to keep
   weekly journal entries during the first five months of their medical
   apprenticeship. In journal entry analyses, the authors identified themes
   through a consensus-building coding process detailed in the work of
   Maykut and Morehouse (1994) and Huckin (2004). For this article, the
   authors focus on those themes most closely related to the students'
   caring experiences during their apprenticeship.
   Results: The data highlight components of the medical system which made
   it difficult for students to engage in caring practices during their
   apprenticeship: the competing discourses of empathy and efficiency, the
   objectification of patients, the power of the medical hierarchy, and the
   institutionalized practice of wounding.
   Conclusion: The authors argue that returning medical care and students'
   experience to a balance of attention to curing and caring is a complex
   undertaking requiring a re-conceptualization of the process and goals of
   medical care.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: We wanted to explore cognitive and affective attitudes towards
   communication skills among students in Norwegian medical schools.
   Method: 1833 (60\% response rate) medical students at the four medical
   schools in Norway filled in questionnaires by the end of term in May
   2003. The Communication Skills Attitudes Scale (CSAS) was used for
   assessing affective and cognitive attitudes separately.
   Results and conclusions: Medical students have positive attitudes
   towards learning and using communication skills. Cognitive and affective
   attitudes displayed different patterns. Being female and having worked
   in the health services before admission to the medical school predicted
   more positive scores both towards cognitive and affective attitudes.
   Having worked as a junior doctor during medical school predicted more
   positive cognitive attitudes. Cognitive attitudes towards communication
   skills did not vary significantly between year groups in any of the
   medical schools. Scores reflecting affective attitudes gradually fell
   for each year in all schools, but rose again in the final year in two of
   them. Implications for curriculum design are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Professionalism is comprised of a set of values and
   behaviours that underpin the social contract between the public and the
   medical profession. Medical errors are reported to result in significant
   morbidity and mortality and are in-part related to underdeveloped
   professionalism.
   Aims: The aim was to determine whether specific aspects of
   professionalism were underdeveloped in medical students.
   Method: A questionnaire with 24 vignettes was taken by Year 2, 4, and 6
   medical students and their responses were compared to responses from
   practicing Medical Academics.
   Results: Second, fourth and sixth Year medical students' responses
   differed from Academics in two aspects of professionalism, firstly, high
   ethical and moral standards and secondly, humanistic values such as
   integrity and honesty. Only Year 2 medical students' responses were
   different from Academics when it came to responsibility and
   accountability.
   Conclusions: Certain aspects of professionalism seem to be
   underdeveloped in medical students. These aspects of professionalism may
   need to be targeted for teaching and assessment in order that students
   develop as professionally responsible practitioners. In turn, students
   with well-developed professionalism may be less involved in medical
   error, and if involved they may have the personal values which can help
   them deal with error more honestly and effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is a skill that can be acquired by practise and
   should become a habit.
   Aims: Assess the impact of a communication skills workshop on the
   empathy level of medical students and medical residents.
   Methods: Quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test study. Empathy level was
   assessed in 203 subjects using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE), divided in two groups: one control group, and other experimental
   group that participated in an activity consisting of a 25-hour
   theoretical/practical workshop on communication and empathy.
   Results: The mean pre-workshop JSPE score was similar in both groups.
   Post-workshop JSPE score increased 5.24 points (95 CI 3.82-7.09)
   (P<0.0001) in the experimental group, improving in 68.9\% of
   participants. No significant increase in JSPE score after the second
   assessment was observed in the controls. For this difference the
   estimated effect size was 0.78.
   Conclusions: A communication skills workshop yields a slight improvement
   of crucial practice importance in subjects' empathy.}},

Pages = {{400-406}},
Abstract = {{Background: Research on the relationship between personality and
   specialty interest is important because of its implications in student
   career counseling and in forecasting future specialty distribution.
   Aim: This study was designed to test the following hypotheses: 1.
   Students interested in `surgical' specialties would obtain higher scores
   on a measure of `impulsive sensation seeking' and lower scores on a
   measure of `neuroticism-anxiety'. 2. Students interested in
   `hospital-based' specialties would score lower on a measure of
   `sociability' whereas those interested in `primary care' would score
   higher on this measure. In addition to these two hypotheses, gender
   differences on personality were also examined.
   Method: Study participants were 1,076 students who matriculated at
   Jefferson Medical College between 2002 to 2006. A short version of the
   Zuckerman-Kuhlman personality questionnaire (ZKPQ) measuring five
   personality factors of `impulsive sensation Seeking',
   `neuroticism-anxiety', `aggression-hostility', `sociability', and
   `activity' was completed by research participants at the beginning of
   medical school. Students were also asked to note their specialty
   interests. Results: Multivariate statistical analyses confirmed the
   first and partially confirmed the second research hypotheses.
   Results also showed that men scored higher on `impulsive sensation
   seeking,' and women outscored men in the `neuroticism-Anxiety' and
   `activity' scales.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that information about the personalities
   of medical students can help to predict their career interests.
   Implications for career counseling are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Medical students need to learn how to recognize and manage
   critically ill patients; to communicate in critical situations with
   patients, families, and the healthcare team; and finally, to integrate
   technical knowledge with communication skills in caring for these
   patients. Meeting their needs will help prepare them to demonstrate, as
   physicians, the ability to synthesize information while simultaneously
   caring for patients, that the American Medical Association recently
   characterized as vital. Aims: Responding to these needs, we developed
   and implemented a curriculum to enable students in a required emergency
   medicine clerkship to recognize, manage, and simultaneously communicate
   with critically ill patients. Methods: The curriculum consisted of
   lectures and exercises on caring for the critically ill including: an
   introduction to the systematic approach; an interactive lecture on
   comprehensive communication; observation and discussion of real patients
   in the emergency department; participation in a single standardized
   patient encounter while peers and a faculty member observed them;
   assessment of students' own videotaped performance of the examination by
   using critical care and communication/interpersonal skills checklists;
   and receipt of private feedback based on the checklists from the faculty
   and the standardized patient. Students evaluated the curriculum at the
   end of the clerkship. Results: Complete performance data for 46 students
   and curriculum evaluation data from 42 students were available.
   According to faculty assessment, students as a group performed 79.6\%
   (SD 0.15) of the critical care and 70.9\% (SD 11.5\%) of the
   communication skills. Students most often demonstrated Basic
   Interpersonal Skills (97.9\%, SD 0.056) and least often demonstrated
   Empathy skills (41.7\%, SD 0.235). Students rated the curriculum
   positively. Conclusions: It is feasible to integrate the teaching of
   communication skills with the recognition and management of critically
   ill patients. The next step will be to revise the curriculum to address
   student deficiencies and to evaluate its effectiveness more rigorously.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Pages = {{E208-E217}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical regulatory organizations worldwide require
   competency in communication skills. Pediatric communication competencies
   are unique, and little is known about pediatric residents' perceptions
   regarding these skills.
   Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine pediatric residents'
   attitudes about communication skills, their perceptions of the
   importance of learning 15 specific communication skills relevant to
   pediatrics, confidence in these skills, and relevant program supports.
   Methods: We developed a 47-item cross-sectional questionnaire to study
   pediatric residents' attitudes and perceptions regarding communication
   competencies. 104 pediatric housestaff in a university-affiliated
   program in the US were asked to complete the questionnaire. Scale
   variables were created and evaluated for reliability. Data were analysed
   using descriptive and univariate statistics.
   Results: Response rate was 86\% (89/104). Cronbach's alpha reliabilities
   of the Importance Scale (r = 0.92) and Confidence Scale (r = 0.90) were
   excellent. Ninety nine percent of the participants agreed that learning
   to communicate effectively with patients was a priority. All agreed it
   is important to demonstrate empathy and caring, and to teach medical
   students to communicate effectively with patients. Pediatric residents
   agreed that the 15 communication competencies studied were important to
   learn. Most reported confidence in core communication competencies
   (interviewing, listening, building rapport, demonstrating caring and
   empathy), but only half or fewer were confident in 7 more advanced
   communication skills (ability to discuss end-of-life issues, speaking
   with children about serious illness, giving bad news, dealing with the
   `difficult' patient/parent, cultural awareness/sensitivity,
   understanding psychosocial aspects, and understanding patients'
   perspectives). Few reported the availability of relevant program
   supports for learning these skills.
   Conclusions: Pediatric residents perceive communication competencies as
   important and a priority for learning, yet report a lack of confidence
   in advanced communication skills and insufficient program supports. Our
   measurement scales can add to the evaluation of residency programs, and
   may provide suggestions for pediatric curricular content in core and
   advanced communication skills.}},

Abstract = {{Regardless of the treatment regimens and ongoing research we do as
   medical doctors and scientists, our bottom line is to improve the lives
   of those suffering from pancreatic cancer; certainly not an easy
   undertaking. In a previous issue of Pancreatology (April 2008, vol. 8),
   our editor discussed the importance of empathy toward our patients. In
   reflecting on the mission of trying to accomplish this goal, it is the
   patients, themselves, and their families who can offer the best insight
   into the quality of life of the patient. In this issue, the focus is on
   pancreatic cancer patients and their families who have formed
   foundations and websites toward the cause. Their insight should be
   valued not only for the support group they form for other patients but
   for medical doctors and researchers as well. In addition, their advocacy
   for this devastating disease is essential to our mission both in their
   generosity with funding and in their voices to our governments for more
   national funding in this area. The human factor should never be erased
   from our thoughts. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel and IAP.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The physician-caregiver relationship affects patients' health
   outcomes, but measures of this important relationship are lacking. We
   develop and validate the physician-caregiver relationship scales (PCRS),
   incorporating three relationship domains (liking, understanding,
   dominance).
   Methods: Videotapes of 100 children's visits were coded for verbal and
   nonverbal communication. Roter interaction analysis system utterance
   categories (personal remarks, laughter, agreements, approvals, concerns,
   reassurances, back channels and empathy) and summary measures (physician
   proportion of total talk and of number of questions) along with
   nonverbal measures (touch initiations, upright postures and leaning
   toward a participant) were used as indicators. Model fit was evaluated
   with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Validity was evaluated by
   associations of the PCRS with visit characteristics and global affect
   ratings.
   Results: PCRS domains incorporating verbal and nonverbal indicators
   demonstrated good model fit (RMSEA < 0.05; SRMR < 0.12; TLI and CFI >
   0.95). Construct and predictive validity were demonstrated with PCRS
   domains relating to visit characteristics and affect ratings as
   predicted.
   Conclusions: CFA supported the multi-dimensional PCRS with three
   domains-liking, understanding and dominance. Such measures are valuable
   tools for investigations of physician-caregiver relationships.
   Practice implications: Models suggest specific indicators of the

Abstract = {{Background
   Evidence of the beneficial effects of longer consultations in general
   practice is limited.
   Aim
   To evaluate the effect of increasing consultation length on patient
   enablement in general practice in an area of extreme socioeconomic
   deprivation.
   Design of study
   Longitudinal study using a `before and after' design.
   Setting
   Keppoch Medical Centre in Glasgow, which serves the most deprived
   practice area in Scotland.
   Method
   Participants were 300 adult patients at baseline, before the
   introduction of longer consultations, and 324 at follow-up, more than 1
   year after the introduction of longer consultations. The intervention
   studied was more time in complex consultations. Patient satisfaction,
   perceptions of the GPs' empathy, GP stress, and patient enablement were
   collected by face-to-face interview. Additional qualitative data were
   obtained by individual interviews with the GPs, relating to their
   perceptions of the impact of the longer consultations.
   Results
   Response rates of 70\% were obtained. Overall, 53\% of consultations
   were complex. GP stress was higher in complex consultations. Patient
   satisfaction and perception of the GPs' empathy were consistently high.
   Average consultation length in complex consultations was increased by
   2.5 minutes by the intervention. GP stress in consultations was
   decreased after the introduction of longer consultations, and patient
   enablement was increased. GPs' views endorsed these findings, with more
   anticipatory and coordinated care being possible in the longer
   consultations.
   Conclusion
   More resource to provide more time in complex consultations in an area
   of extreme deprivation is associated with an increase in patient
   enablement.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preterm delivery followed by the loss of the preterm child
   is a stressful event for parents and is frequently associated with
   psychological distress or even psychiatric morbidity. Little is known as
   yet about the factors which help parents to cope. The aim of this study
   was to analyze the most helpful factors for parents during the period of
   delivery and the death of the child.
   Methods: At 2-6 years after the death of their premature child (22-26
   gestational week) 26 mothers (M) and 25 fathers (F) answered questions
   on what helped them most to come to terms with the death of their
   premature child. The answers were analyzed by means of qualitative
   content analysis.
   Results: Content analysis highlighted four factors felt to be helpful:
   about 1/3 of the persons questioned (M=33.6\%, F=34.7\%) considered good
   social support to be very helpful. Mothers felt that their personal
   coping abilities were also very important and mentioned them
   significantly more often compared to fathers (M=32.7\%, F=25.3\%).
   Professional support by the hospital staff was found to be another
   helpful factor and was cited more often by fathers than by mothers
   (M=21.5\%, F=29.3\%). Support by staff in this context did not only
   refer to medical support but also to empathy and sympathy offered by
   staff and the manner in which this was communicated. The fourth factor
   found to be relevant was the existence of other children or the birth of
   a further child after the loss (M = 12.2\%, F = 10.7 \%).
   Conclusions: Good social support appears to be the most important factor
   helping parents to cope successfully with the loss of their preterm
   child. Professional support by hospital staff was found to be a very
   important factor for fathers in helping them to cope with the death of
   their child. In clinical practice, therefore, special attention should
   be paid to the communication skills of hospital staff.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to explore
   patient- and physician-specific determinants of physician empathy (PE)
   and to analyse the influence of PE on patient-reported long-term
   outcomes in German cancer patients.
   Methods: A postal survey was administered to 710 cancer patients, who
   had been inpatients at the University Hospital Cologne (response rate
   49.5\%). PE was measured with the German translation of the consultation
   and relational empathy (CARE) measure, and patient-reported long-term
   outcomes were assessed using the major (ICD-10) depression inventory
   (MDI) and the EORTC quality of life (Qo1) questionnaire QLQ-C30.
   Hypotheses were tested by structural equation modelling.
   Results: PE had (a) a moderate indirect effect on ``depression{''} and a
   smaller indirect effect on ``socio-emotional-cognitive Qo1{''} by
   affecting ``desire for more information from the physician regarding
   findings and treatment options{''} and (b) a moderate indirect effect on
   ``socio-emotional-cognitive Qo1{''} and a smaller effect on
   ``depression{''} via ``desire for more information about health
   promotion{''}. The determinant with the greatest importance was
   ``patient-perceived general busyness of hospital staff{''}: it had a
   strong negative influence on PE, indirectly influencing ``desire for
   more information from the physician regarding findings and treatment
   options{''} and also patients' ``depression{''}.
   Conclusion: PE seems to be an important pre-requisite for information
   giving by physicians and through this pathway having a preventive effect
   on depression and improving Qo1. Conversely, physicians' stress
   negatively influences these relationships.
   Practice implications: The research findings suggest that reducing
   physicians' stress at the organizational and individual may be required
   to enhance patient-physician communication. Empathy, as an
   outcome-relevant professional competence needs to be assessed and
   developed more intensively in medical students and physicians. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Objective: The present study has been designed to test for the effect of
   physicians' gender on the perception and assessment of empathic
   communication in medical encounters.
   Methods: Eighty-eight volunteers were asked to assess six transcribed
   interactions between physicians and a standardized patient. The effects
   of physicians' gender were tested by the experimental manipulation of
   physicians' gender labels in transcripts. Participants were randomly
   assigned to one of two testing conditions: (1) perceived gender
   corresponds to the physician's true gender; (2) perceived gender differs
   from the physician's true gender. Empathic communication was assessed
   using the Rating Scales for the Assessment of Empathic Communication in
   Medical Interviews.
   Results: A 2 (physician's true gender: female vs. male) x 2 (physician's
   perceived gender: female vs. male) x 2 (rater's gender: female vs. male)
   mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) yielded a main effect
   for physician's true gender. Female physicians were rated higher on
   empathic communication than male physicians irrespective of any gender
   labels.
   Conclusion: The present findings suggest that gender differences in the
   perception of physician's empathy are not merely a function of the
   gender label. These findings provide evidence for differences in male
   and female physicians' empathic communication that cannot be attributed
   to stereotype bias.
   Practice implications: Future efforts to evaluate communication skills
   training for general practitioners may consider gender differences. (c)

Abstract = {{The terms professionalism and humanism are sometimes confused as being
   synonymous; even more confusing, each is sometimes regarded as a
   component feature of the other. The author argues that, in the context
   of medicine, the two terms describe distinctly different, albeit
   intimately linked attributes of the good doctor. Professionalism denotes
   a way of behaving in accordance with certain normative values, whereas
   humanism denotes an intrinsic set of deep-seated convictions about one's
   obligations toward others. Viewed in this way, humanism is seen as the
   passion that animates professionalism. Nurturing the humanistic
   predispositions of entering medical students is key to ensuring that
   future physicians manifest the attributes of professionalism. Medical
   educators are encouraged to recognize the role of humanism in
   professional development and to incorporate into their curricula and
   learning environments explicit means to reinforce whatever inclinations
   their students have to be caring human beings. Chief among those means
   are respected role models who unfailingly provide humanistic care,
   ceremonies that celebrate the attributes of humanism, awards that honor
   exemplars of the caring physician, and serious engagement with the
   medical humanities to provide vivid insights into what a humanistic
   professional is.}},

Abstract = {{Decisions about admissions to medical school are based on assessments of
   the applicants' cognitive achievements and non-cognitive traits.
   Admission criteria are expected to be fair, transparent, evidence-based
   and legally defensible. However, unlike cognitive criteria, which are
   highly reliable and moderately valid, the reliability and validity of
   the non-cognitive criteria are low or uncertain. Their uncertain
   predictive value is due not only to their limited validity, but also to
   the unknown prevalence of the desirable non-cognitive traits in the
   applicants' pool. Consequently, the use of non-cognitive admission
   criteria inevitably leads to rejection of an unknown proportion of
   applicants who have a desirable trait and selection of applicants who
   lack this trait. We propose that, rather than using non-cognitive
   admission criteria, admission officers should assist prospective
   applicants to make informed decisions based on a reflective
   self-appraisal whether or not to apply to medical school. To this end,
   medical schools should disseminate information on the strains of medical
   training and practice, the frequency of medical errors and the most
   common causes of dissatisfaction and burn-out among practicing
   physicians. Such information may improve the self-selection process and
   thereby enrich the applicants' pool for individuals with appropriate
   motivation. The final selection of medical students may then be based
   either on past academic achievements, or on a lottery, or on various
   combinations thereof.}},

Title = {{The inverse care law: Clinical primary care encounters in deprived and

Abstract = {{PURPOSE The inverse care law states that the availability of good
   medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the
   population served, but there is little research on how the inverse care
   law actually operates.
   METHODS A questionnaire study was carried out on 3,044 National Health
   Service (NHS) patients attending 26 general practitioners (GPs); 16 in
   poor areas (most deprived) and 10 in affluent areas (least deprived) in
   the west of Scotland. Data were collected on demographic and
   socioeconomic factors, health variables, and a range of factors relating
   to quality of care.
   RESULTS Compared with patients in least deprived areas, patients in the
   most deprived areas had a greater number of psychological problems, more
   longterm illness, more multimorbidity, and more chronic health problems.
   Access to care generally took longer, and satisfaction with access was
   significantly lower in the most deprived areas. Patients in the most
   deprived areas had more problems to discuss (especially psychosocial),
   yet clinical encounter length was generally shorter. GP stress was
   higher and patient enablement was lower in encounters dealing with
   psychosocial problems in the most deprived areas. Variation in patient
   enablement between GPs was related to both GP empathy and severity of
   deprivation.
   CONCLUSIONS The increased burden of ill health and multimorbidity in
   poor communities results in high demands on clinical encounters in
   primary care. Poorer access, less time, higher GP stress, and lower
   patient enablement are some of the ways that the inverse care law
   continues to operate within the NHS and confounds attempts to narrow
   health inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{Infant colic is a common but poorly defined and understood clinical
   entity and, while several causative factors have been suggested, a
   unifying theory of its pathogenesis is still required. Food
   hypersensitivity/allergy and gut dysmotility are the lead contenders for
   causative factors of infantile colic. Additional confounders and
   covariables include psychological and social factors. Although the
   available data fail to provide insight into the exact triggers of
   infantile colic, these do allow for the hypothesis that certain infants
   are predisposed to dietary protein intolerance and disturbed gut
   motility, such as visceral hypersensitivity/hyperalgesia, in the first
   few weeks of life. These processes lead to distress and altered
   perceptions, where normal stimuli (ie, intestinal distension) are
   misinterpreted as painful events. This review discusses a number of
   interventions, including pharmacological agents, which are based on the
   perceived pathogenesis; however, it is likely that infants with colic
   will require a multifactorial management strategy. Healthcare providers
   must offer support, reassurance and empathy to the caregiver, and adopt
   a biopsychosocial approach to the infants and their families by
   considering any underlying medical diseases in addition to examining the
   family unit. In a small subset of infants with colicky behavior, a
   specific medical disorder such as gastroesophageal reflux or milk
   protein allergy may be identified. While the vast majority of infants
   with colic will recover uneventfully, some may be at risk for the later
   development of behavioral problems and atopy/allergy.}},

Abstract = {{HIV-positive injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk for transmitting
   HIV to their sex and injection partners, and compared with non-IDUs,
   they have poorer access to medical care and adherence to antiretroviral
   therapies. Social support has been linked with decreased injection and
   sexual risk behaviors and slower disease progression. In this
   qualitative process evaluation, we explored emotional support (ie,
   caring, empathy), informational support (ie, information, guidance,
   feedback), and appraisal support (ie, information for self-evaluation or
   understanding) received by participants in the Interventions for
   Seropositive Injectors-Research and Evaluation (INSPIRE) project, a
   multisite secondary prevention intervention for HIV-positive IDUs.
   Participants in the intervention and control conditions (N = 40)
   described similar experiences in terms of type, source, and perceived
   benefits of social support received from the program. Emotional support
   was received from program staff, other participants, and elements of the
   intervention. Participants also mentioned social support received from
   the INSPIRE project in relation to changes they had made in their lives
   during and after their involvement in the intervention, such as changes
   in their drug use, sexual practices, and health care utilization.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Empathy is important in the physician-patient relationship.
   Prior studies have suggested that physician empathy may decline with
   clinical training. OBJECTIVE: To measure and examine student empathy
   across medical school years.
   DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of students at Boston
   University School of Medicine in 2006. Incoming students plus each class
   near the end of the academic year were surveyed.
   MEASUREMENTS: The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version
   (JSPE-S), a validated 20-item self-administered questionnaire with a
   total score ranging from 20 to 140. JSPE-S scores were controlled for
   potential confounders such as gender, age, anticipated financial debt
   upon graduation, and future career interest.
   RESULTS: 658 students participated in the study (81.4\% of the school
   population). The first-year medical student class had the highest
   empathy scores (118.5), whereas the fourth-year class had the lowest
   empathy scores (106.6). Measured empathy differed between second- and
   third-year classes (118.2 vs 112.7, P < .001), corresponding to the
   first year of clinical training. Empathy appears to increase from the
   incoming to the first-year class (115.5 vs 118.5, P = .02). Students
   preferring people-oriented specialties had higher empathy scores than
   students preferring technology-oriented specialties (114.6 vs 111.4, P =
   .002). Female students were more likely than male students to choose
   people-oriented specialties (51.5 vs 26.9\%, P < .001). Females had
   higher JSPE-S scores than males (116.5 vs 112.1, P < .001). Age and debt
   did not affect empathy scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Empathy scores of students in the preclinical years were
   higher than in the clinical years. Efforts are needed to determine
   whether differences in empathy scores among the classes are cohort
   effects or represent changes occurring in the course of medical
   education. Future research is needed to confirm whether clinical
   training impacts empathy negatively, and, if so, whether interventions
   can be designed to mitigate this impact.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To identify emotion skills training methods and outcomes using
   a systematic review of medical student curricula studies.
   METHODS We searched the English language literature listed in the
   PubMed, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsycINFO and
   Web of Science databases, from 1980 to the present, using a
   comprehensive list of emotion skills keywords and subsequent hand
   searches. A total of 828 articles were initially identified. A manual
   search yielded 161 articles on broadly defined emotion skills
   educational programmes for medical students. A more stringent review and
   hand search of reference lists yielded a final 26 articles that included
   `other-directed' emotion skills (i.e. cognitive and behavioural skills
   intended to manage the emotions of others), a description of the
   training programme, and assessment data.
   RESULTS Emotion skills courses varied by total number of contact hours
   (2-64 hours), session frequency (from 1 session per day to 1 session
   every 6 months), duration (2 weeks to 2 years), pedagogy, patients
   targeted and educational outcomes. Student evaluation data were
   positive. Fifteen of 26 studies used objective emotion skills measures.
   Only 6/26 studies included a control or comparison condition and 5/26
   used a randomised, controlled trial (RCT) design. All 5 RCTs showed
   positive outcomes with modest improvements in emotion communication
   skills, empathy, use of emotion words, supportive behaviours and
   enriched patient understanding.
   CONCLUSIONS The heterogeneity of emotion skills curricular studies makes
   direct comparisons difficult. However, all controlled trials showed
   positive outcomes, suggesting the importance and effectiveness of
   `other-directed' emotion skills training. No specific recommendations
   about curricular amount and frequency, timing and pedagogy can be made.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT Many patients in primary care somatise psychological distress.
   Training general practitioners (GPs) to manage somatisation has been
   shown to lead to improvements in their management of these patients.
   However, the training has been intensive and conducted by psychiatrists,
   making it impractical for widespread use. The aim of this research was
   to determine the effectiveness of a teaching package in improving the
   ability of GP registrars to manage patients who somatise, when taught by
   GP vocational course tutors within the constraints of a general practice
   vocational training scheme.
   METHODS This was a before-and-after training evaluation of GP
   registrars' skills. A total of 22 GP registrars and 6 GP course
   organisers were recruited from 3 GP vocational training schemes. The GP
   trainees had 2 videotaped consultations with trained actors role-playing
   patients with somatised depression, before and 1 month after training.
   RESULTS There was a significant overall improvement in the ability of GP
   registrars to manage patients who somatise (mean scores on a 4-point
   Likert scale: pre-training 1.4 {[}standard deviation, SD, 0.6];
   post-training 2.2 {[}SD 0.9]; P = 0.002). General practice registrars
   improved their ability to use a negotiating style of consultation (skill
   present in 8/22 pre-training, 16/22 post-training; P = 0.02) and also
   demonstrated more empathy during the `consultation' after training (mean
   scores on a 5-point Likert scale: pre-training 2.3 {[}SD 1.0];
   post-training 3.0 {[}SD 0.8]; P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS Using a structured training package, it is possible for GP
   vocational course tutors to successfully teach GP registrars to manage
   patients who somatise psychological distress. Given limited resources
   for teaching in terms of cost and time, this training package could have
   important implications for training medical staff.}},

Title = {{Outcome related to impact on daily living: preliminary validation of the
   ORIDL instrument}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: The challenge of finding practical, patient- rated outcome
   measures is a key issue in the evaluation of health care systems and
   interventions. The ORIDL ( Outcome in Relation to Impact on Daily
   Living) instrument ( formerly referred to as the Glasgow Homoeopathic
   Hospital Outcomes Scale or GHHOS) has been developed to measure
   patient's views of the outcome of their care by asking about change, and
   relating this to impact on daily life. The aim of the present paper is
   to describe the background and potential uses of the ORIDL, and to
   report on its preliminary validation in a series of three studies in
   secondary and primary care.
   Methods: In the first study, 105 patients attending the Glasgow
   Homoeopathic Hospital ( GHH) were followed- up at 12 months and changes
   in health status were measured by the EuroQol ( EQOL) and the ORIDL. In
   the second study, 187 new patients at the GHH were followed- up at 3,
   12, and 33 months, using the ORIDL, the Short Form 12 ( SF- 12), and the
   Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile ( MYMOP). In study three, 323
   patients in primary care were followed for 1 month post- consultation
   using the ORIDL and MYMOP. In all 3 studies the Patient Enablement
   Instrument ( PEI) was also used as an outcome measure.
   Results: Study 1 showed substantial improvements in main complaint and
   well- being over 12 months using the ORIDL, with two- thirds of patients
   reporting improvements in daily living. These improvements were not
   significantly correlated with changes in serial measures of the EQOL
   between baseline and 12 months, but were correlated with the EQOL
   transitions measure. Study 2 showed step- wise improvements in ORIDL
   scores between 3 and 33 months, which were only weakly associated with
   similar changes in SF- 12 scores. However, MYMOP change scores
   correlated well with ORIDL scores at all time points. Study 3 showed
   similar high correlations between ORIDL scores and MYMOP scores. In all
   3 studies, ORIDL scores were also significantly correlated with PEI-
   outcome scores.
   Conclusion: There is significant agreement between patient outcomes
   assessed by the ORIDL and the EQOL transition scale, the MYMOP, and the
   PEI- outcome instrument, suggesting that the ORIDL may be a valid and
   sensitive tool for measuring change in relation to impact on life.}},

Abstract = {{At the University of Helsinki, pain-related topics are taught throughout
   medical studies but without a formal pain curriculum. The purpose of
   this study was to assess medical students' attitudes towards pain.
   A questionnaire using a 6-point Likert scale was constructed to measure
   pain-related attitudes and beliefs described in previous studies. After
   a pilot study, the questionnaire was developed to assess attitudes
   towards elderly patients' pain, prescription of opioids. assessment of
   pain and anxiety concerning chronic pain and its treatment. An
   electronic questionnaire with seven demographic and 28 pain-related
   items was sent via e-mail to 680 medical students at the University of
   Helsinki, Finland. Three reminders were sent with a new letter of
   encouragement. The students had 3 weeks to answer the questionnaire.
   The questionnaire was returned by 63.4\% of the students (N = 430).
   There were statistically significant differences between the students in
   different study years showing increasing empathy towards elderly
   patients' pain (p < 0.001), willingness to prescribe opioids (p < 0.001)
   and anxiety about meeting patients suffering from chronic pain (p <
   0.01). Final year students felt significantly more often anxious about
   seeing a chronic pain patient) < 0.05) compared with the first year
   students. Female students were more anxions about seeing a patient
   suffering from chronic pain (p < 0.05) and they were less confident of
   their ability to treat chronic pain patients in primary care) < 0.001)
   than the male students.
   The general attitudes of students mature as hoped for during medical
   studies. Attitudes towards treating the pain of cancer patients and
   elderly patients are positive. Attention should be paid to helping
   students to cope with their emotions and to reducing their anxiety about
   meeting patients with chronic pain. (c) 2006 European Federation of

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical empathy, a critical skill for the doctor-patient
   relationship, is infrequently taught in graduate medical education. No
   study has tested if clinical empathy can be taught effectively.
   Objective: To assess whether medicine residents can learn clinical
   empathy techniques from theater professors.
   Design: A controlled trial of a clinical empathy curriculum taught and
   assessed by 4 theater professors.
   Setting: Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, a large
   urban university and health system.
   Participants: Twenty Internal Medicine residents: 14 in the intervention
   group, 6 in the control group.
   Intervention: Six hours of classroom instruction and workshop time with
   professors of theater.
   Measurements: Scores derived from an instrument with 6 subscores
   designed to measure empathy in real-time patient encounters. Baseline
   comparisons were made using two-sample T tests. A mixed-effects analysis
   of variance model was applied to test for significance between the
   control and intervention groups.
   Results: The intervention group demonstrated significant improvement (p
   <=.011) across all 6 subscores between pre-intervention and
   post-intervention observations. Compared to the control group, the
   intervention group had better posttest scores in 5 of 6 subscores (p
   <=.01).
   Limitations: The study was neither randomized nor blinded.
   Conclusions: Collaborative efforts between the departments of theater
   and medicine are effective in teaching clinical empathy techniques.}},

   doctors to develop positive relationships with their patients. In
   practice, communication tends to be defined primarily as what doctors
   say, with less attention to how, when, and to whom they say it. These
   latter elements of communication, which often carry the emotional
   content of the discourse, are usually referred to as interpersonal
   skills. Although recognized as important by some educators,
   interpersonal skills have received much less attention than
   task-oriented, verbal aspects. Moreover, the field lacks a common
   language and conceptualization for discussing them. This paper offers a
   framework for describing interpersonal skills and understanding their
   relationship to verbal communication and describes an interpersonal
   skill-set comprised of Understanding, Empathy, and Relational
   Versatility.}},

Abstract = {{Context.There is considerable interest in the attributes other than
   cognitive ability that medical students need in order to be
   professionally successful, with a particular focus on empathy and
   emotional intelligence (EI). Selection considerations have also
   motivated interest in such attributes as predictors of academic success.
   There are reports of declines in empathy in US medical students, but no
   comparative information is available for UK students.
   Objectives.This study aimed to compare empathy levels in medical
   students in Years 2, 3 (pre-clinical) and 5 (clinical), to examine
   gender differences in empathy and EI, and to investigate whether EI and
   empathy are related to academic success.
   Methods.Questionnaires assessing EI and empathy were completed by
   students. Previous empathy scores for the Year 2 cohort were also
   available. Empathy trends were examined using ANOVA; trends for the Year
   2 group for whom Year 1 scores were available were examined using
   repeated-measures ANOVA. Associations of EI and empathy with academic
   success were examined using Pearson correlation.
   Results.A significant gender x cohort effect was found, with male
   empathy scores increasing between Years 1 and 2, whilst female scores
   declined. Peer ratings in Year 2 problem-based learning (PBL) groups
   were positively correlated with EI.
   Conclusions.Trends in levels of empathy differed by gender. The reasons
   for this require further investigation, particularly in relation to
   course content. Associations between academic performance and EI were
   sparse, and there were none between academic performance and empathy,
   but the effects of EI (and other characteristics) on PBL group
   functioning represent a promising area for future study.}},

Journal = {{NEUROTHERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{545-548}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Medical care of patients with dementia often occurs within a
   physician-patient relationship whose features differ from relationships
   with patients without dementia. Many basic assumptions of the
   physician-patient relationship may not completely hold true, and certain
   aspects of the patient role may be shared by others besides the patient.
   For example, the entire premise of consent to the patient role may be
   inapplicable to patients who lack insight into their illness. In
   addition, caring for cognitively impaired patients who do not comprehend
   the purpose of the physician-patient interaction may render physicians
   vulnerable to losing empathy with their patients and objectifying them.
   This can lead to viewing patients as collections of symptoms rather than
   as humans suffering with illnesses and burdens. The fact that certain
   medical interventions, such as treatment of neuropsychiatric
   disturbances that do not trouble the patient, may appear to be initiated
   for the primary purpose of alleviating caregiver emotional stress also
   affects the physician-patient relationship. The present review examines
   how this relationship may be altered and presents a framework within
   which these alterations can be considered.}},

   students in resolving conflicts.
   Method: The scope of the research was all the students of the nursing
   college and faculty of medical. The sample included 359 students of the
   nursing college and 367 medical students. The data gathering tools used
   were a questionnaire covering socio-demographical attributes and the
   conflict-resolving tendency scale. Percentage computations, t-test
   (significance test between two independent groups) and one-way variance
   analysis (ANOVA) were utilized during the evaluation of the data.
   Findings and conclusion: In the light of the findings of the study, it
   was defined that there were significant differences between the students
   of the two schools in their conflict-resolving tendencies, with nursing
   college students having higher levels of conflict-resolving tendencies,
   as welt as in their empathy, listening skills and requirement-focused
   approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To explore residents' competency in medical knowledge and in
   empathy, one element of professionalism, and to evaluate the
   relationship between competencies in these domains.
   Method in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, first-year internal medicine
   residents at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota
   were invited to participate in a prospective, longitudinal study of
   resident competency. Participating residents completed the annual
   Internal Medicine In-Training Examination (ITE) each October and the
   Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a standardized tool to measure
   empathy administered at multiple time points during training. Changes in
   medical knowledge and empathy between the fall of postgraduate years one
   and two were evaluated, and associations between medical knowledge and
   empathy were explored.
   Results Residents' medical knowledge as measured by the ITE increased
   over the first year of training (mean increase 8.7 points, P < .0001),
   whereas empathy as measured by the empathic concern subscale of the IRI
   decreased over this same time period (mean decrease 1.6 points, P =
   .0003). No significant correlation was found between medical knowledge
   and empathy or between changes in these domains of competency over time.
   Conclusions Resident competency in the domains of medical knowledge and
   empathy seems to be influenced by separate and independent aspects of
   training. Training environments may promote competency in one domain
   while simultaneously eroding competency in another. Residency programs
   should devise specific curricula to promote each domain of physician
   competency.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Significant information exchange occurs between a doctor and
   patient through nonverbal communication such as gestures, body position,
   and eye gaze. In addition, empathy is an important trust-building
   element in a physician: patient relationship. Previous work validates
   the use of virtual patients (VP) to teach and assess content items
   related to history-taking and basic communication skills. The purpose of
   this study was to determine whether more complex communication skills,
   such as nonverbal behaviors and empathy, were similar when students
   interacted with a VP or standardized patient (SP).
   Methods: Medical students (n = 84) at the University of Florida (UF) and
   the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) underwent a videotaped interview
   with either a SP or a highly interactive VP with abdominal pain. In the
   scenario, a life-sized VP was projected on the wall of an exam room in
   SP teaching and testing centers at both institutions. VP and SP scripted
   responses to student questions were identical. To prompt an empathetic
   response (ie, acknowledging the patients' feelings), during the
   interview the VP or SP stated ``I am scared; can you help me?{''}
   Clinicians (n = 4) rated student videotapes with respect to nonverbal
   communication skills and empathetic behaviors using a Likert-type scale
   with anchored descriptors.
   Results: Clinicians rated students interacting with SPs higher with
   respect to the nonverbal communication skills such as head nod (2.78 +/-
   .79 vs 1.94 +/- .44, P <.05), and body lean (2.97 +/- .94 vs 1.93 +/-
   .58, P <.05), level of immersion in the scenario (3.31 +/- .49 vs 2.26
   +/- .52, P <.05), anxiety (1.16 +/- .31 vs 1.45 +/- .33, P < .05),
   attitude toward the patient (3.24 +/- .43 vs 2.89 +/- .36, P < .05), and
   asking clearer questions (3.06 +/- .32 vs 2.51 +/- .32, P < .05)
   compared to the VP group. The students in the SP group also had a higher
   empathy rating (2.75 +/- .86 vs 2.16 +/- .83, P < .05) and better
   overall rating (4.29 +/- 1.32 vs 3.24 +/- 1.06, P < .05) than the VP
   group. Empathy was positively correlated with the observed nonverbal
   communication behaviors. Eye contact was the most strongly correlated
   with empathy (r =.57, P < .001), followed by head nod (r =.55, P < .001)
   and body lean (r =.49, P < .001).
   Conclusions: Medical students demonstrate nonverbal communication
   behaviors and respond empathetically to a VP, although the quantity and
   quality of these behaviors were less than those exhibited in a similar
   SP scenario. Student empathy in response to the VP was less genuine and
   not as sincere as compared to the SP scenario. While we will never
   duplicate a real physician/patient interaction, virtual clinical
   scenarios could augment existing SP programs by providing a
   controllable, secure, and safe learning environment with the opportunity
   for repetitive practice. (C) 2007 Published by Excerpta Medica Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic pain is very common in all European countries, with
   musculoskeletal problems predominating. About 1\% of the adult
   population develops a syndrome of chronic muscle pain, fibromyalgia
   (FMS), characterized by multiple tender points, back or neck pain, and a
   number of associated problems from other organs, including a high
   frequency of fatigue. Evidence points to central sensitization as an
   important neurophysiological aberration in the development of FMS.
   Importantly, these neurological changes may result from inadequately
   treated chronic focal pain problems such as osteoarthritis or myofascial
   pain. It is important for health professionals to be aware of this
   syndrome and to diagnose the patients to avoid a steady increase in
   diagnostic tests. On the other hand, patients with chronic widespread
   pain have an increased risk of developing malignancies, and new or
   changed symptoms should be diagnosed even in FMS. In rheumatology
   practice it is especially important to be aware of the existence of FMS
   in association with immune inflammatory diseases, most commonly lupus
   and rheumatoid arthritis. Differential diagnoses are other causes of
   chronic pain, e.g. thyroid disease. The costs of this syndrome are
   substantial due to loss of working capability and direct expenses of
   medication and health-system usage. Fibromyalgia patients need
   recognition of their pain syndrome if they are to comply with treatment.
   Lack of empathy and understanding by healthcare professionals often
   leads to patient frustration and inappropriate illness behavior, often
   associated with some exaggeration of symptoms in an effort to gain some
   legitimacy for their problem. FMS is multifaceted, and treatment
   consists of both medical interventions, with emphasis on agents acting
   on the central nervous system, and physical exercises.}},

Abstract = {{Even though the importance of empathy for a good
   physician-patient-relationship is consistently emphasized, there are
   only a few empirical investigations. In this study the empathy of
   surgeons was evaluated by asking them to put themselves in the
   preoperative situation of a patient with a rectal carcinoma. They should
   state the quality of life from the patient's point of view using the
   EORTC-QLQ-C30. As a second step the assumed postoperative quality of
   life of the patients at the point of their discharge from hospital was
   evaluated. The data collected from the surgeons were compared with the
   results of a prospective longitudinal analysis of the quality of life of
   rectal carcinoma patients. As well the preoperative situation of the
   patients as their situation before discharge from hospital were
   evaluated more negatively by the surgeons than by the patients
   themselves. The doctors assumed much more problems and especially a
   deeper negative impact on the social and emotional acting of the
   patients. The surgeons and additionally questioned non-medical staff
   members did not differ in their results, just as the period of
   employment had no significant influence on the outcome. Accordingly to
   the results it can be deduced that the patients felt better than the
   doctors assumed, so that we can advise the surgeons to intensify the
   empathy in their patients' perception. Therefore, new course curricula
   should be developed to train the non-technical-skills of health
   professionals.}},

Abstract = {{The paper sets forth a set of evidence-based recommendations for
   interventions to combat unintentional bias among health care providers,
   drawing upon theory and research in social cognitive psychology. Our
   primary aim is to provide a framework that outlines strategies and
   skills, which can be taught to medical trainees and practicing
   physicians, to prevent unconscious racial attitudes and stereotypes from
   negatively influencing the course and outcomes of clinical encounters.
   These strategies and skills are designed to: 1) enhance internal
   motivation to reduce bias, while avoiding external pressure; 2) increase
   understanding about the psychological basis of bias; 3) enhance
   providers' confidence in their ability to successfully interact with
   socially dissimilar patients; 4) enhance emotional regulation skills;
   and 5) improve the ability to build partnerships with patients. We
   emphasize the need for programs to provide a nonthreatening environment
   in which to practice new skills and the need to avoid making providers
   ashamed of having racial, ethnic, or cultural stereotypes. These
   recommendations are also intended to provide a springboard for research
   on interventions to reduce unintentional racial bias in health care.}},

Abstract = {{The androgen theory of autism proposes that autism spectrum conditions
   (ASC) are in part due to elevated fetal testosterone (FT) levels, which
   are positively correlated with a number of autistic traits and inversely
   correlated with social development and empathy. A medical questionnaire
   was completed by n = 54 women with ASC, n = 74 mothers of children with
   ASC, and n = 183 mothers of typically developing children to test
   whether women with ASC have an increased rate of testosterone-related
   medical conditions, and to see whether mothers of children with ASC show
   similar abnormalities, as part of the `broader autism phenotype'.
   Compared to controls, significantly more women with ASC reported (a)
   hirsutism, (b) bisexuality or asexuality, (c) irregular menstrual cycle,
   (d) dysmenorrhea, (c) polycystic ovary syndrome, (f) severe acne, (g)
   epilepsy, (h) tomboyism, and (i) family history of ovarian, uterine, and
   prostate cancers, tumors, or growths. Compared to controls,
   significantly more mothers of ASC children reported (a) severe acne, (b)
   breast and uterine cancers, tumors, or growths, and (c) family history
   of ovarian and uterine cancers, tumors, or growths. These results
   suggest current hormone abnormalities in women with ASC and their
   mothers. Direct investigations of serum testosterone levels and genetic
   susceptibility to high testosterone production or sensitivity in women
   with ASC would illuminate the origin of these conditions. The
   relationship between FT and current testosterone levels also needs to be
   clarified. The present results may be relevant to understanding the
   increased male risk to developing autism. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Physicians associate empathy with benevolent emotions and with
   developing a shared understanding with patients. While there have been
   many articles on managing ``difficult{''} patients, little attention has
   been paid to the challenges physicians face during conflicts with
   patients, especially when both parties are angry and yet empathy is
   still needed. This topic is especially important in light of recent
   studies showing that practicing medicine increasingly requires
   physicians to manage their own feelings of anger and frustration. This
   article seeks to describe how physicians can learn to empathize with
   patients even when they are both subject to emotions that lead to
   interpersonal distancing. Empathy is defined as engaged curiosity about
   another's particular emotional perspective. Five specific ways for
   physicians to foster empathy during conflict are described: recognizing
   one's own emotions, attending to negative emotions over time, attuning
   to patients' verbal and nonverbal emotional messages, and becoming
   receptive to negative feedback. Importantly, physicians who learn to
   empathize with patients during emotionally charged interactions can
   reduce anger and frustration and also increase their therapeutic impact.}},

Abstract = {{Medical students enter medical school hoping to have good relationships
   with their patients. Along with residents, however, they are exposed to
   a hidden curriculum that places the acquisition of biomedical knowledge
   above and at times at odds with development of the awareness and
   relationship skills important to the patient-physician relationship.
   Seasoned clinicians often enjoy the capacity for rich, healing
   relationships that are marked by reciprocal influence between them and
   their patients. The author argues that it is not necessary to relegate
   this recapturing of the human side of medicine to a midcareer epiphany,
   and the author calls for educational measures to encourage development
   of the communication and relationship-building skills throughout the
   medical education process. This will require a paradigm shift to a
   culture where teachers and learners are willing to consciously attend to
   their relationships and to work on self-awareness and mindfulness while
   they also master the biomedical knowledge required of the profession.
   Medical educators can facilitate and support continuous development of
   these skills throughout medical school and residency. Within the
   curriculum, there are many opportunities to teach how to reflect and to
   guide those reflections in ways that enhance our students' and
   residents' understanding of themselves as individuals and in the
   relationships they form with their patients. Using examples from
   narratives gathered in workshops and on work rounds with students and
   residents at the University of Washington School of Medicine, the author
   explores the concepts of relationship-centered care, self-awareness, and
   mindfulness as proposed cornerstones of a new foundation for medical
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Providers of care for children undergoing stem cell transplantation
   (SCT) skillfully combine the roles of scientist and clinician. As
   scientists, they apply scientific methods and disease theory in the
   creation and testing of new therapies and in the careful observation and
   exploration of treatment outcomes. As clinicians, they are capable of
   intuitively delivering care in a patient- and family-centered context of
   meaning and life values.
   The specialty of SCT has inherent aspects that make treatment decision
   making complex and potentially contentious. Having a strategy ready to
   implement in advance or at the time when treatment decisions need to be
   made mill facilitate and enhance the decision making process for both
   the health care team and family members. Here we introduce the
   individualized care planning and coordination (ICPC) model as a
   practical approach to facilitate ethical and effective decision making
   in pediatric SCT settings. The ICPC is a 3-step model comprising (1)
   relationship-understanding the illness experience from the perspective
   of the patient and family, sharing relevant information, and assessing
   ongoing needs; (2) negotiation-prognosticating, establishing goals of
   care, and discussing treatment options; and (3) plan-generating a
   comprehensive plan of care that includes life and medical plans. Based
   on a foundation of a care of competence, empathy, compassion,
   communication, and quality, the ICPC model aims to diminish contentious
   family staff interactions that can lead to mistrust and help guide
   treatment decision making. The ICPC model enhances communication among
   patients, families, and clinicians by revealing patient and family
   values and medical and quality-of-life priorities before reaching or
   even during critical decision points in the transplantation process. (C)

Abstract = {{Facial nerve palsy affects individuals of all ages, races, and sexes.
   Psychological and functional implications of the paralysis present a
   devastating management problem to those afflicted, as well as the
   carriers. Since Sir Charles Bell's original description of facial palsy
   in 1821, Our understanding and treatment options have expanded. It is
   essential that a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing
   ophthalmologists; Ear, Nose, and Throat surgeons; plastic surgeons; and
   psychologists work closely to optimize patient management in a staged
   approach. Although the etiology remains unknown, strong histological,
   cerebral spinal fluid, and radiological evidence suggests a possible
   association with herpes simplex virus in idiopathic facial nerve palsy
   (Bell's palsy). The use of steroids has been suggested as a means of
   limiting facial nerve damage in the acute phase. Unfortunately, no
   single randomized control trial has achieved an unquestionable benefit
   with the use of oral steroid therapy and thus remains controversial. In
   the acute phase, ophthalmologists play a pivotal role in preventing
   irreversible blindness from corneal exposure. This may be successfully
   achieved by using intensive lubrication, medical therapy (botulinum
   toxin), or surgery (upper lid weighting or tarsorraphy). Once the cornea
   is adequately protected and recovery deemed unlikely, longer term
   planning for evelid and facial reanimation may take place in an

Abstract = {{Purpose Clinical empathy is integral to forging therapeutic
   patient-physician relationships. Illness narratives are a potentially
   rich source of insight into what it feels like to be a patient or
   patient's family member. The authors performed a qualitative analysis of
   illness narratives to develop an explicit framework for understanding
   what it feels like to be a health care recipient and to explore how
   providers' behaviors influence that experience.
   Method The authors used consensual qualitative research, a methodology
   based on principles of grounded theory, to analyze 24 illness narratives
   found in that number of essays from the Annals of Internal Medicine's
   ``On Being a Patient{''} series published between January 1, 1999, and
   December 31, 2003. Trustworthiness was demonstrated via essayists'
   feedback on the analysis.
   Results Patients and their families faced formidable physical and
   psychosocial challenges. Providers' behaviors influenced the illness
   experience in profoundly positive and negative ways, independent of the
   technical quality of care. Consistent with previous studies of
   patient-physician relationships, providers' advocacy for patients and
   expressions of compassion were prominent determinants of patients'
   satisfaction. The experience of simultaneously being a health care
   provider and consumer was an additional source of stress for essayists,
   but it positively influenced their subsequent practice.
   Conclusions Illness narratives vividly illustrate fundamental aspects of
   the illness experience and are a potentially rich resource for
   cultivating empathy. The authors' analysis provides a framework for
   enhancing trainees' and practitioners' ability to understand and meet
   patients' and families' psychosocial needs. The experiences of health
   care recipients with medical backgrounds are uniquely challenging and
   beneficial.}},

Title = {{How do distress and well-being relate to medical student empathy? A

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lower levels of empathy among a sample
   of medical students in the United States are associated with personal
   and professional distress and to explore whether a high degree of
   personal well-being is associated with higher levels of empathy.
   DESIGN: Multi-institutional, cross-sectional survey.
   SETTING: All medical schools in Minnesota (a private medical school, a
   traditional public university, and a public university with a focus in
   primary care).
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,098 medical students.
   MEASUREMENTS: Validated instruments were used to measure empathy,
   distress (i.e., burnout and symptoms of depression), and well-being
   (high quality of life).
   RESULTS: Medical student empathy scores were higher than normative
   samples of similarly aged individuals and were similar to other medical
   student samples. Domains of burnout inversely correlated with empathy
   (depersonalization with empathy independent of gender, all P <.02, and
   emotional exhaustion with emotive empathy for men, P=.009). Symptoms of
   depression inversely correlated with empathy for women (all P <=.01). In
   contrast, students' sense of personal accomplishment demonstrated a
   positive correlation with empathy independent of gender (all P <.001).
   Similarly, achieving a high quality of life in specific domains
   correlated with higher empathy scores (P <.05). On multivariate analysis
   evaluating measures of distress and well-being simultaneously, both
   burnout (negative correlation) and well-being (positive correlation)
   independently correlated with student empathy scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both distress and well-being are related to medical student
   empathy. Efforts to reduce student distress should be part of broader
   efforts to promote student well-being, which may enhance aspects of
   professionalism. Additional studies of student well-being and its
   potential influence on professionalism are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Spirituality is a major domain of palliative medicine
   training. No data exist on how it is taught, nor is there a consensus
   about the content or methods of such education. We surveyed palliative
   medicine fellowship directors in the United States to learn how they
   teach spirituality, who does the teaching, and what they teach.
   Methods: A, PubMed (www.pubmed.gov)) search using the terms
   ``spirituality{''} and ``medical education{''} was completed. Thirty-two
   articles outlined spirituality education content and methods in in
   medical schools and residency programs. From these articles, a survey on
   spirituality education in palliative medicine fellowship training was
   prepared, pilot-tested, revised, and then distributed by e-mail in June
   2004 to the 48 U.S. palliative medicine fellowship directors listed on
   the American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) website,
   but excluding the three fellowship programs represented by the authors.
   Follow up requests were sent by email twice during the 6-week collection
   period. The Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of
   Wisconsin approved the study.
   Results: Fourteen fellowship directors completed the survey (29\% of all
   programs; 42\% of those currently teaching fellows as indicated on the
   AAHPM website). All programs indicated they taught ``spirituality{''};
   12 of 14 had separate programs for teaching spirituality and 2 of 14
   reported they taught spirituality to their fellows but not as a
   distinct, separate program. All respondents taught the definitions of
   spirituality and religion, common spiritual issues faced by patients at
   end of life (which was not defined further), and the role of chaplains
   and clergy. Chaplains provided spirituality education in all of the
   responding programs, but other team members were frequently involved.
   The most common formats for education in the domains of knowledge and
   attitudes were small group discussion, lecture, and self-study. Small
   group discussion, supervision, and shadowing a chaplain or other
   professional were the most common methods used for skills. Faculty
   written or oral evaluations of fellows were the most common forms of
   evaluation, with little evidence of more robust assessment methods, such
   as structured role-play (none of the programs surveyed).
   Conclusions: Palliative medicine fellowship programs generally agree on
   the content of training on spirituality, but have not incorporated
   robust educational and evaluation methods to ensure that fellows have
   obtained the desired attitudes, knowledge, and skills to meet the
   Initial Voluntary Program Standards for Residency Education in
   Palliative Medicine of the American Board of Hospice and Palliative
   Medicine. Based on the survey data and results from the literature
   review, broad recommendations are made to enhance spirituality
   education.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE Patient-centredness should be at the heart of medical education.
   This longitudinal study aimed to assess possible attitude changes
   towards patient-centredness in a medical students' cohort as they
   progressed through the clinical curriculum. It also investigated the
   possible impact of socio-demographic factors on students' attitudes.
   METHODS The same student cohort was tested on 2 occasions: during their
   initial exposure to clinical curricula (year 4) and after 2 years, at
   the end of the clerkship (year 6). Students completed a questionnaire
   including demographics and the 18-item Patient-Practitioner Orientation
   Scale (PPOS). PPOS differentiates between patient-centred versus
   doctor-centred or disease-centred orientation, measuring attitudes along
   2 dimensions: `sharing' and `caring'.
   RESULTS A total of 483 fully completed questionnaires was returned
   (response rate 83\%). The cohort's attitudes were significantly more
   doctor-centred at the end of their studies compared to the beginning of
   their clinical curricula (P < 0.001). However, regarding the caring part
   of their relationship with patients, they maintained a satisfactory
   level of patient-centredness. Concerning sharing information, female
   students were significantly more patient-centred at year 4, with their
   mean score decreasing at the end of their clerkship. Furthermore, among
   only female students, having a looser relationship with religion was
   associated with more patient-centred attitudes.
   CONCLUSIONS Increased authoritarianism in graduating students' attitudes
   emphasises clearly the need for future research and redesigning
   communication curricula. Furthermore, the influence of gender and
   relationship with religion on attitudes towards the doctor-patient
   relationship should be explored further, in order to eliminate
   disparities in the provision of patient-centred medical care.}},

Abstract = {{Conclusion. Our bedside interviews with patients with head neck cancer
   are unique and valuable educational experiences for undergraduate
   medical students. Objective. How can we help medical students to
   understand patients' thoughts and feelings? We believe that students can
   learn and practice empathy at the patient's bedside. Subjects and
   methods. Sixty medical students in their final year at the University of
   Tokyo and 10 patients with head and neck cancer were supervised by a
   professor and senior head and neck surgeons. Questionnaires were
   delivered to each student before and after bedside teaching, to
   investigate their impressions on thoughts and feelings of patients with
   head and neck cancer. Questions to patients were composed of: 1)
   backgrounds: birthplace, education, occupation and hobby; 2) cancer: the
   time of the first visit to clinic and the time of referral to the
   University of Tokyo Hospital; 3) preoperative feelings; 4) impression of
   surgical treatment and postoperative care; and 5) messages to medical
   students from the patient. Medical students also asked additional
   questions. Results. Before the bedside teaching our medical students
   believed that it must be important to listen to patients (100\%); and
   that it must be possible to encourage patients (50\%). After the bedside
   teaching they noticed that a medical interview could have a positive
   influence on the patient (93\%), probably because of general
   conversation (45\%), the patient's personality ( 50\%), listening to
   information about the patient's birthplace, education, occupation and
   hobby (48\%), and the instructor's life experiences (25\%). Most
   patients asked medical students to be good doctors who can understand
   their thoughts and feelings.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{On the theme of Linus Geisler's nine steps for a successful consultation
   between doctor and patient, the ability for self-criticism, the ability
   to be able to listen to oneself and the value of the doctor-patient
   relationship in the context of medical practice will be discussed.
   Subsequently, the framework of the consultation, the consulting room
   atmosphere and the complete setting of the consultation will be dealt
   with. The importance of active listening and the recognition of all
   messages, both verbal and from body language, will be particularly
   emphasized. The capability for empathy is presented as the necessary
   bridge to recognition of the feelings and inner world of the patient.
   Because one only sees what one is looking for and only recognizes what
   one knows, the recognition of typical complaints presented by patients
   in a consultation represents the ``something{''} which must be
   specifically elucidated. The problems and symptoms which the patient
   brings to the doctor are surrounded by a ring of fears and
   apprehensions. For this reason it is decisive to uncover the
   accompanying cloud of fears and apprehensions with appropriate
   questions, to correctly assign the unsettling symptoms of the patient
   and to be able to correctly interpret them. As illustrated by the
   language of nature - the translation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
   triplets into amino acids - the translation of biological, psychological
   and social aspects of the complaints symptomatic into the level of
   diagnosis and the translation of the referential, social and affective
   meaning of the expressions used by the patient, into the level of the
   significance will be discussed. The role of the doctor here is that of a
   producer of context and a skilled translator.
   In the management of functional disorders and chronic diseases the
   construction of a shared reality is important. The therapeutic function
   of consultations is due to an introduction of metaphors as bridges -
   bridges to an improved understanding of the body, the self and the
   world. The role of the physician here is that of a moderator, motivator
   an accompanying person. Finally, Jaspers levels of good doctoring
   (natural science or causal level, nursing level,
   communicative-existential level) are stressed and the importance of a
   good patient-physician relationship for a patient-centered medicine is
   underlined.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Interest in training in psychiatry appears to be in decline.
   To pursue reasons why a career in psychiatry is not regarded as an
   attractive option for trainees, attitudes of senior Australian medical
   students were surveyed. Method: Fifty five medical students from one
   university were set a question inviting them to detail reasons why
   doctors might be less likely to train in psychiatry as part of their
   written examination in psychiatry. Several major themes and salient
   statements were identified from a qualitative analysis. Results:
   Analysis identified several multifaceted factors, including a difficult
   and pressured work environment and lack of resources due to chronic
   underfunding; perceived deficiency of personal skills, such as empathy;
   inadequate income; negative implications of stigma, low prestige, and
   limited patient gratitude and job satisfaction. These issues, coupled
   with the widespread belief that the discipline is unscientific and not
   ``real medicine'', may contribute to later decisions not to pursue
   training in psychiatry. Conclusions: While the framing of the research
   question was biased towards eliciting negative evaluations of a career
   in psychiatry, the responses are nonetheless instructive in helping to
   understand the reasons why potential trainees might be discouraged from
   the field. If psychiatry is to attract high-quality recruits, there is
   clearly a need to address stigmatizing attitudes within the medical
   hierarchy, and provide positive educational experiences for medical
   students that excite their imagination about a career or even a calling
   - as against its negative `job' status.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Animal cruelty is a significant problem for society, and there are good
   reasons why doctors should be particularly concerned by it. Increasing
   evidence for links between animal cruelty and child or spousal abuse is
   an area of growing concern internationally and of real importance to
   health professionals.
   OBJECTIVE
   This article aims to raise awareness of the relevance of animal cruelty
   to medical practice. The links between animal cruelty and human health
   are discussed broadly and some wider ethical issues raised.
   DISCUSSION
   Animal cruelty impacts on human health in disparate ways: intentional
   and unintentional acts of cruelty may reflect underlying mental health
   problems that need to be addressed. Cruelty within the family setting is
   an important sentinel for domestic violence and should prompt an
   assessment for possible child abuse. Furthermore, animal cruelty raises
   important questions about the nature of empathy, and the type of society
   that we wish to live in.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The objective of this study was to compare doctor-patient
   communications in clinical consultations via telemedicine technology to
   doctor-patient communications in face-to-face clinical consultations.
   Method Five doctors who had been practicing internal medicine for 8 to
   18 years, and twenty patients were enrolled in this study; neither
   doctors nor patients had previous experience of telemedicine. The
   patients received both a telemedicine consultation and a face-to-face
   consultation. Three measures - video observation, medical record volume,
   and participants' satisfaction - were used for the assessment.
   Results It was found that the time spent on the telemedicine
   consultation was substantially longer than the time spent on the
   face-to-face consultation. No statistically significant differences were
   found in the number of either closed or open-ended questions asked by
   doctors between both types of consultation. Empathy-utterances,
   praise-utterances, and facilitation-utterances were, however, seen less
   in the telemedicine consultations than in the face-to-face
   consultations. The volume of the medical records was statistically
   smaller in the telemedicine consultations than in the face-to-face
   consultations. Patients were satisfied with the telemedicine
   consultation, but doctors were dissatisfied with it and felt hampered by
   the communication barriers.
   Conclusions This study suggests that new training programs are needed
   for doctors to develop improved communication skills and the ability to
   express empathy in telemedicine consultations.}},

Abstract = {{Whether observation of distress in others leads to empathic concern and
   altruistic motivation, or to personal distress and egoistic motivation,
   seems to depend upon the capacity for self other differentiation and
   cognitive appraisal. In this experiment, behavioral measures and
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to
   investigate the effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal
   while participants observed the facial expression of pain resulting from
   medical treatment. Video clips showing the faces of patients were
   presented either with the instruction to imagine the feelings of the
   patient ({''}imagine other{''}) or to imagine oneself to be in the
   patient's situation ({''}imagine self{''}). Cognitive appraisal was
   manipulated by providing information that the medical treatment had or
   had not been successful. Behavioral measures demonstrated that
   perspective-taking and treatment effectiveness instructions affected
   participants' affective responses to the observed pain. Hemodynamic
   changes were detected in the insular cortices, anterior medial cingulate
   cortex (aMCC), amygdala, and in visual areas including the fusiform
   gryrus. Graded responses related to the perspective-taking instructions
   were observed in middle insula, aMCC, medial and lateral pre-motor
   areas, and selectively in left and right parietal cortices. Treatment
   effectiveness resulted in signal changes in the perigenual anterior
   cingulate cortex, in the ventromedial orbito-frontal cortex, in the
   right lateral middle frontal gyrus, and in the cerebellum. These
   findings support the view that humans' responses to the pain of others
   can be modulated by cognitive and motivational processes, which
   influence whether observing a conspecific in need of help will result in
   empathic concern, an important instigator for helping behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed and compared residents' beliefs and concerns about
   using opioids for treating pain in patients with cancer and noncancer
   low back pain (NLBP). Participants included 72 Internal Medicine and
   Medicine-Pediatrics residents who completed a survey questionnaire.
   Based on a scale of 0 = ``No concern{''} to 10 = ``Very concerned,{''}
   residents expressed greater concern that treating NLBP with opioids,
   compared with cancer-related pain, causes addiction (6.01 vs 1. 15),
   abuse (5.57 vs 1.39), and side effects (4.76 vs 2.87); limits other
   treatments (5.36 vs 1.30); draws criticism from faculty (4.33 vs 0.88);
   or risks sanctioning (state board 4.12 vs 1.12, legal 4.06 vs 1. 17); p
   < 0. 00 1 for each (paired t-tests). They had more comfort (8.94 vs 4.3
   1) and more empathy (9.09 vs 6.79) using opioids to treat for cancer
   pain than NLBP and would give whatever doses necessary for pain control
   (8.41 vs 3.66); p < 0.001 for each. Our findings show that residents are
   far more concerned about using opioids to treat NLBP than cancer-related
   pain.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the impact of undergraduate psychiatry placements in primary
   care settings on students' learning and attitudes to mental illness.
   Questionnaire survey and qualitative in-depth interviews.
   A primary care-based psychiatry undergraduate teaching programme at
   Royal Free and University College Medical School, London.
   A total of 145/183 (79.2\%) students attending the primary care-based
   programme over 2 academic years completed a questionnaire survey.
   In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 students, 12 general
   practitioner (GP) tutors and 20 patients participating in the course.
   In the questionnaire survey, 121/144 (84.0\%) students valued the
   primary care-based teaching highly. In total, 87/139 (62.6\%) students
   felt their attitudes to mental illness had changed as a result of the
   course. In-depth interviews demonstrated 4 key benefits of the teaching
   programme: increasing breadth of experience, understanding the patients'
   experience, learning about mental illness from a GP's perspective and
   changing students' attitudes towards mental illness. The students'
   attitudinal shift comprised 2 main dimensions; `normalisation' of mental
   illness and increased empathy.
   Learning psychiatry in primary care settings offers students a broader
   experience of a range of patients than in hospital settings and
   encourages a `person-centred' approach, which in turn can have a
   positive impact on their attitudes to mental illness, reducing
   stereotyping and increasing empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Talking with a family whose child is dying is painful and challenging,
   yet can be a profoundly rewarding aspect of a physician's work. At some
   time, every physician must give patients bad news. If this conversation
   is carried out well, with preparation, compassion, genuine empathy and
   skill, this adds considerably to the physician's capacity to provide
   comprehensive care. Until recently however, there has been little or no
   training for this sensitive and delicate undertaking. Recent research
   indicates that breaking bad news to a family is a trainable skill. Data
   show a high consistency in the desirable traits for good communication.
   These are compassion, clinical accuracy, honesty, and availability. The
   literature emphasizes allowing sufficient time in a quiet private
   setting, following the families' agenda, using nontechnical language,
   being emotionally responsive and not doing it alone. Training should
   include constructive feedback on communication skills, on patient's
   perception, addressing interventions, and determining patient's and
   caregivers' support systems. Parental feedback during end-of-life care
   indicates that maintaining hope, while being honest about what is
   happening, enables families to cope. Integrating siblings of the dying
   child is an essential part of successfully talking with the family, as
   they too carry a heavy burden of grief. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Background: Competency-based models of medical education require
   reliable and valid assessment of multiple physician roles.
   Aims: To develop and evaluate an objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) designed to assess 7 physician competencies (CanMEDS
   Roles).
   Methods: Twenty four candidates from 4 neonatal-perinatal medicine
   training programs participated in a 10-station OSCE. Ten 5-point rating
   scales were developed and used to assess the CanMEDS Roles of Medical
   Expert, Communicator, Collaborator, Manager, Health Advocate, Scholar
   and Professional. Three descriptors of performance anchored the ratings.
   For each station, examiners completed appropriate CanMEDS ratings, a
   station-specific binary checklist and an overall process- related global
   rating. Trained standardized patients (SP) and standardized health
   professionals (SHP) completed rating scales that assessed verbal and
   non-verbal expression, empathy and coherence as well as the overall
   global rating.
   Results: Each station incorporated 3-5 physician Roles. Interstation
   alpha was 0.80 for checklist scores and 0.88 for examiners' overall
   global rating. Median interstation alpha for individual CanMEDS ratings
   was 0.72 (range 0.08-0.91). There were significant correlations between
   examiner Medical Expert scores and SP/SHP overall global scores and
   between examiner Communicator scores and 4 SP/SHP assessments of
   communication skills. Second year trainees' CanMEDS scores for each
   competency were significantly higher than those of first year trainees
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The OSCE may be useful as a reliable and valid method of
   simultaneously assessing multiple physician competencies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study solicits third and fourth year medical students'
   attitudes about and experiences with callousness.
   Methods: Medical students were asked to respond to an on-line survey
   assessing demographic information, their experiences with seeing
   callousness modeled by mentors and their attitudes about callousness.
   Participants included 74 students roughly split on gender and year in
   school.
   Results: A 2 x 2 between-subjects MANOVA was conducted (dependent
   variables-attitudes about and experiences with callousness; independent
   variables-gender and year in school). Significant results were found for
   gender; follow-up analyses revealed that women hold more unfavorable
   attitudes about callousness than men. Although students generally
   regarded callousness as undesirable, they reported seeing callousness
   modeled by their mentors 20\% of the time across a variety of
   situations.
   Conclusions: Students' attitudes about callousness are negative; women's
   attitudes are more negative than men's. Despite this, students
   (regardless of their demographic variations) regularly see it modeled by
   their mentors. Some students' narrative responses suggest they think
   being callous toward patients and colleagues can serve them well in some
   situations. The authors offer several questions to motivate further
   empirical and ethical inquiry into callousness and urge medical
   educators to consider its influence on students' conceptions of
   professionalism.}},

Abstract = {{Background: One of the US government health goals outlined in the
   Healthy People 2010 document (2000) is to increase the number of
   physicians who counsel their patients regarding unhealthy behaviors.
   Studies have shown a low rate of physicians provide smoking cessation
   counseling. We introduced a motivational interviewing curriculum into
   our medical school for first and third year students and then evaluated
   the effect of this curriculum on third year students counseling skills.
   Methods: The motivational interviewing curriculum was comprised of a
   lecture series and small group teaching with practice in role plays. The
   effectiveness of the curriculum was evaluated by student performance in
   a videotaped interview with a standardized patient who portrayed a
   smoker. The interview was rated using the Motivational Interviewing
   Treatment Integrity scoring tool (MITI). The MITI assesses 6 criteria:
   empathy, MI spirit (autonomy, evocation and collaboration), MI adherence
   (asking permission, affirmation, emphasis of control and support), MI
   non adherence (advise, confront and direct), the types of questions
   (open or closed) and the number of reflections. Secondary outcomes
   included a knowledge exam related to motivational interviewing and
   students' evaluations of the effectiveness of the motivational
   interviewing curriculum.
   Results: Analysis of the MITI scores showed that students reached a
   proficiency level on the rate of reflections, were just below
   proficiency in assessment of empathy and motivational interviewing
   spirit and substantially below proficiency in the percent of open ended
   questions. These proficiency scores were for professional counselors but
   nevertheless provided us with information on the effectiveness of the
   new curriculum and where the focus of our teaching should be. On the
   optional evaluation of the first-year MI curriculum by 112 students,
   83\% felt that the MI curriculum had helped them be more comfortable in
   discussing behavior change with patients and 98\% felt it was an
   important skill for physicians to have.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several professional bodies have developed influential
   documents which have tried to describe the essential competences of a
   good doctor. Such an initiative has not been previously conducted in
   German-speaking countries. Differences between the published statements
   point towards the significance of differences in the respective
   sociocultural setting.
   Methods: The first step was to take advantage of a series of
   standardized written interviews {[}including the item,What makes a
   doctor a good doctor?{''}], conducted with leading German physicians and
   published serially in the Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift. Responses
   were qualitatively analysed by three assessors in accordance with
   Grounded Theory. Text fragmentation and assignment of categories was
   built successively: it was based on the actual material and repeatedly
   revised.
   Results: 261 statements were extracted from a total of 83 interviews. It
   was possible to assign 249 of them to one of the following nine
   categories:,knowledge{''},,empathy{''} and,patient orientation{''} and,
   less frequently,practical
   competence{''},,genuineness{''},,helper{''},,awareness of
   limits{''},,life-long learning{''} and,cooperation{''}. Results were
   similar for older and younger physicians, or when comparing
   representatives of clinical and theoretical disciplines.
   Conclusions: It will be worthwhile to survey and evaluate the opinion of
   additional members of the medical profession and of patients and others
   with a stake in the health system - comparing and delineating results
   from different countries - so that a more comprehensive picture can be
   drawn of,,the good doctor{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Medical procedures in outpatient settings have limited options of
   managing pain and anxiety pharmacologically. We therefore assessed
   whether this can be achieved by adjunct self-hypnotic relaxation in a
   common and particularly anxiety provoking procedure. Two hundred and
   thirty-six women referred for large core needle breast biopsy to an
   urban tertiary university-affiliated medical center were prospectively
   randomized to receive standard care (n = 76), structured empathic
   attention (11 = 82), or self-hypnotic relaxation (it = 78) during their
   procedures. Patients' self-ratings at 10 min-intervals of pain and
   anxiety on 0-10 verbal analog scales with 0 = no pain/anxiety at all, 10
   = worst pain/anxiety possible, were compared in an ordinal logistic
   regression model. Women's anxiety increased significantly in the
   standard group (logit slope = 0.18, p < 0.001), did not change in the
   empathy group (slope = -0.04 P = 0.45), and decreased significantly in
   the hypnosis group (slope = -0.27, p < 0.00 1). Pain, increased
   significantly in all three groups (logit slopes: standard care = 0.53,
   empathy = 0.37, hypnosis = 0.34; all p < 0.001) though less steeply with
   hypnosis and empathy than standard care (p = 0.024 and p = 0.018,
   respectively). Room time and cost were not significantly different in an
   univariate ANOVA despite hypnosis and empathy requiring an additional
   professional: 46 min/\$161 for standard care, 43 min/\$163 for empathy,
   and 39 min/\$152 for hypnosis. We conclude that, while both structured
   empathy and hypnosis decrease procedural pain and anxiety, hypnosis
   provides more powerful anxiety relief without undue cost and thus
   appears attractive for outpatient pain management. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{One element of a good doctor is that of being a kind, considerate and
   honourable professional practitioner. These features of a `good person'
   are enshrined in a German-Jewish concept of being a `mensch', a term
   that could describe some of the attributes of a good doctor, although
   other cultures may have equivalent concepts.
   We will discuss the argument for role modelling, empathy, reflective
   practice, and some of the virtues inherent in good UK General Practice
   to be a principle of education for undergraduate medical students. GPs
   are trained to view patients holistically and are important members of
   their local communities, so this is a suitable role for general practice
   within the undergraduate medical curriculum. Good GPs may be able to act
   as role models and to provide the basis for a discussion on their
   professional role with real patients in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{The protocols specifying the basic rules of the doctor-patient
   relationship that have been proposed in the literature are primarily
   intended for referring physicians, in particular oncologists. With
   regard to the improving radiologists' communication skills, a simple
   tool, RADPED, was developed to help residents in pediatric radiology to
   memorize the main points of the patient-radiologist interaction. We
   suggest a protocol, CREDO, more precisely appropriated to the everyday
   practice of medical imaging, in particular in oncology. This protocol
   relates not only to the radiologist-patient relationship, but also to
   the rules common to the department's entire team. The aims are to
   establish a partnership with the patient (for this purpose, we suggest
   using the PERLES model: partnership, excuses (apology), respect,
   legitimization, empathy, support), carrying out the examination under
   optimal conditions, listening to what the patient has to say, giving
   information and,above all, organizing the imaging department around the
   patient.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Feedback is an essential tool in medical education, and the
   process is often difficult for both faculty and learner There are strong
   analogies between the provision of educational feedback and
   doctor-patient communication during the clinical encounter.
   Description: Relationship-building skills used in the clinical
   setting-Partnership, Empathy, Apology, Respect, Legitimation, Support
   (PEARLS)-can establish trust with the learner to better manage difficult
   feedback situations involving personal issues, unprofessional behavior,
   or a defensive learner Using the stage of readiness to change
   (transtheoretical) model, the educator can ``diagnose{''} the learner's
   stage of readiness and employ focused interventions to encourage desired
   changes.
   Evaluation: This approach has been positively received by medical
   educators in faculty development workshops.
   Conclusions: A model for provision of educational feedback based on
   communication skills used in the clinical encounter can be useful in the
   medical education setting. More robust evaluation of the construct
   validity is required in actual training program situations.}},

Title = {{How respected family physicians manage difficult patient encounters}},

Year = {{2006}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nearly all family physicians have patients that engender a
   sense of frustration or dislike, often described as ``difficult.{''}
   Most research in this area focuses on describing these patients and
   their physicians, not management or coping.
   Objective: To describe how respected family physicians identify, manage,
   and cope with difficult patient encounters.
   Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interview study. Participant
   physicians described as ``excellent{''} were recommended by medical
   school family medicine faculty around the county. Interview questions
   included ``describe the patient you least like seeing,{''} and `` how do
   you keep sane but still assure adequate care for the patient?{''}
   Interviews were analyzed using the editing method, looking for common
   categories and themes.
   Results: 102 physicians were interviewed. Physicians described both
   patient behaviors ( stay sick and demanding) as well as medical problems
   ( multiple, chronic pain, drug seeking, psychiatric) that they found
   frustrating. Difficult encounters occurred when these patient behaviors
   and medical problems clashed with physicians' personal and practice
   traits. Their management strategies to return the encounter to success
   incorporated collaboration, appropriate use of power and empathy.
   Conclusions: We propose a model where clashes between patient behaviors
   and physicians' traits turn a successful encounter of collaboration,
   appropriate use of power and empathy into a difficult encounter of
   opposition, misuse of power and compassion fatigue. Management
   strategies used by our participants aim to return success to the
   encounter and may serve as a guide for practicing physicians and for
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{The expanding number of Americans living with chronic illness
   necessitates educating future physicians about chronic illness care.
   Weill Cornell Medical College's Chronic Illness Care in the Home Setting
   Program (CIC-HSP), a mandatory part of the primary care clerkship,
   exposes medical students to persons with chronic illness via a half day
   of house calls with a geriatrics team. The investigators sought to
   qualitatively assess the effect of the CIC-HSP on medical students and
   recent medical graduates. Fifty-two prospective participants were
   approached, and 50 (96\%) with varying training levels and time since
   completing the program were interviewed.
   Most respondents (63\%) found that the home visits taught them important
   approaches to caring for the chronically ill, such as individualizing
   care to meet patients' individual needs and improving quality of life as
   a goal of care. Students remarked that the experience enhanced their
   empathy (18\%) and sensitivity (20\%) toward chronically ill patients
   and increased their appreciation for chronic illness care (35\%). Many
   participants reported that patients were more empowered in the home
   (55\%) and perceived greater rapport and warmth between the doctor and
   patient (57\%) in the home (vs office) setting. The vast majority of
   recent medical graduates (84\%) related that this educational exposure
   continued to positively influence their approach to patient care.
   A home visit experience with a geriatrics team can help foster medical
   students' understanding of the psychosocial and medical aspects of
   chronic illness, teach relevant approaches to patient care, and improve
   students' attitudes toward caring for the chronically ill.}},

Abstract = {{While the practice of medicine has changed over the years, including
   technological advances, access to medical information, and the narrowing
   of socio-economic and educational gaps between the clinician and his/her
   patients, the importance of the doctor-patient relationship has not
   diminished over time. This can be a very rewarding interaction. However,
   many physicians experience a great deal of anger, inadequacy and
   frustration, and much of the actual practice of medicine may become a
   burden rather than a source of satisfaction. Physicians may encounter a
   subset of patients who engender strong negative feelings, despair and
   even downright malice. An understanding of the ``hateful patient{''} can
   therefore be very informative to the physician. Several categories of
   such patients may be described, and sensitivity to the phenomenon will
   lead to improved physician well-being, less self-destructive patient
   behavior and a lower risk of litigation. Several factors may assist the
   21st century physician in managing the ``hateful patient{''} in an
   empathic manner and in making some sense of why the patient has resorted
   to negative response patterns. Ultimately, a failure to consider these
   issues will result in poorer medical care and, no less important,
   reduced satisfaction of both patients and doctors. The intention of this
   article is to revisit the concept and to place it in the context of
   contemporary medical practice. (C) 2006 European Federation of Internal

   conducted in Auschwitz by Joseph Mengele, who held both MD and PhD

   physician-scientists have to enhance or degrade human dignity.
   Biomedical science lacks intrinsic morality, but attains moral status by
   virtue of its purpose and the ethical framework that controls its
   conduct, both of which derive from the principles of medical humanism
   codified in the physician's oath. Physician-scientists have
   responsibilities to humankind that transcend the state. Careful analysis
   of historical examples of abuses of human rights committed in the name
   of medical science or the state is an important mechanism to safeguard
   current and future human participants.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: How can residency programs help trainees address
   conflicting emotions about their professional roles and cultivate a
   curiosity about their patients' lives beyond their diseases? We drew on
   the medical humanities to address these challenges by creating an
   intensive writing workshop for internal medicine residents.
   AIM: To help participants become better physicians by reflecting on
   their experiences and on what gives meaning to work and life. This paper
   describes the workshop and how residents were affected by the focus on
   the craft of writing.
   SETTING: A group of 15 residents from 3 training programs affiliated
   with 1 institution.
   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: We engaged the expertise of physician-writer
   Abraham Verghese in planning and facilitating the 2 and one-half day
   workshop. Residents' submissions were discussed with a focus on the
   effectiveness of the writing. We also conducted a focus group with
   participants to evaluate the workshop.
   PROGRAM EVALUATION: Themes in the writing included dysphoria, impotence
   of the physician, and the healing power of compassion. Our focus group
   data suggested that this workshop served as a creative outlet from the
   rigors of medicine, created a sense of community among participants,
   enhanced both self-awareness and awareness of their patients' lives, and
   increased intra-institutional and extra-institutional interest in
   writing and the residency program.
   DISCUSSION: Teaching creative writing to residents in an intensive
   workshop may deepen interactions with peers and patients, improve
   writing skills, and increase interest in writing and the residency
   program.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure acupuncture patients' perceptions of practitioner
   empathy at the initial consultation and its relationship with patient
   enablement, and prospectively reported changes in symptoms.
   Methods: Fifteen acupuncturists asked consecutive new patients to
   complete a questionnaire within 2 days of the first consultation. The
   questionnaire included the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
   measure (a consultation process measure), the Patient Enablement
   Instrument (PEI, a consultation outcome measure) and the Measure
   Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP), a patient-centred symptom,
   well-being and activity outcome measure. A postal follow-up
   questionnaire was completed at 8 weeks, which repeated these measures.
   Results: Fifty-two patients (58\% of all new patients) completed the
   initial questionnaire. Of these, 41 (79\%) completed the follow-up
   questionnaire. From a multiple regression analysis, which controlled for
   known confounders, empathy was found to be associated with enablement at
   the initial consultation (Beta coefficient = 0.16, 95\% CI: 0.02-0.3 1,
   p = 0.03) and empathy-predicted changes in health outcome (MYMOP) at 8
   weeks (Beta = 0.07, 95\% CI: 0.004-0.13, p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Patients' perception of practitioner empathy was associated
   with patient enablement at initial consultation and predicted changes in
   health outcome at 8 weeks. Practice implications: The empathy of
   practitioners, as perceived by patients, has a direct impact on patient
   enablement and health outcome. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Context Medical errors are associated with feelings of distress in
   physicians, but little is known about the magnitude and direction of
   these associations.
   Objective To assess the frequency of self-perceived medical errors among
   resident physicians and to determine the association of self-perceived
   medical errors with resident quality of life, burnout, depression, and
   empathy using validated metrics.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective longitudinal cohort study
   of categorical and preliminary internal medicine residents at Mayo
   Clinic Rochester. Data were provided by 184 (84\%) of 219 eligible
   residents. Participants began training in the 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and
   2005-2006 academic years and completed surveys quarterly through May
   2006. Surveys included self-assessment of medical errors and linear
   analog scale assessment of quality of life every 3 months, and the
   Maslach Burnout Inventory (depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and
   personal accomplishment), Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and a
   validated depression screening tool every 6 months.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of self-perceived medical errors was
   recorded. Associations of an error with quality of life, burnout,
   empathy, and symptoms of depression were determined using generalized
   estimating equations for repeated measures.
   Results Thirty-four percent of participants reported making at least 1
   major medical error during the study period. Making a medical error in
   the previous 3 months was reported by a mean of 14.7\% of participants
   at each quarter. Self-perceived medical errors were associated with a
   subsequent decrease in quality of life (P=.02) and worsened measures in
   all domains of burnout (P=.002 for each). Self-perceived errors were
   associated with an odds ratio of screening positive for depression at
   the subsequent time point of 3.29 (95\% confidence interval, 1.90-5.64).
   In addition, increased burnout in all domains and reduced empathy were
   associated with increased odds of self-perceived error in the following
   3 months (P=.001, P<.001, and P=.02 for depersonalization, emotional
   exhaustion, and lower personal accomplishment, respectively; P=.02 and
   P=.01 for emotive and cognitive empathy, respectively).
   Conclusions Self-perceived medical errors are common among internal
   medicine residents and are associated with substantial subsequent
   personal distress. Personal distress and decreased empathy are also
   associated with increased odds of future self-perceived errors,
   suggesting that perceived errors and distress may be related in a
   reciprocal cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Legal provisions in The Netherlands and Belgium currently
   allow physicians to actively end a patient's life at his or her request
   under certain conditions. The term that is used for this is
   ``euthanasia.{''} Discussion: The same term, ``euthanasia,{''} was used
   in Germany during the Nazi regime for a program of cleansing the
   ``German nation{''} in which untold thousands of persons were denied
   human empathy or medical care and were thereby condemned to death. The
   medical profession played a leading role in the planning,
   administration, and supervision of this ``euthanasia{''} program, with a
   large proportion of German physicians proactively shirking all moral
   responsibility and ultimately paving the way for the Holocaust.
   Conclusion: The term ``euthanasia{''} was so abused during the Nazi
   regime as a camouflage word for murder of selected subpopulations with
   the willing participation of physicians, we believe that, regardless of
   the benevolent goals of current euthanasia practices, for historical
   reasons the term ``euthanasia{''} must not be used with regards to
   current end-of-life care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Education in Sports Medicine is offered heterogeneously in
   German medical schools. Efficacy and acceptance among medical students
   are unknown. The self-image of sports has changed from a traditional,
   competition-oriented way to adventure, entertainment, wellness and
   health. Therefore changes of our curricula to a practical oriented way
   of teaching are required. In this regard a new curriculum was developed.
   The main focus, besides an interdisciplinary class in sports medicine
   was to offer practical education in sports to the students. Methods:
   Efficacy and acceptance of the class were evaluated using a
   questionnaire. 90 medical students (58 male, 32 female) were included
   into the study. Results: The interdisciplinary topics of the class were
   graded positively. Most of the presentations were regarded as very
   useful for the future practice. Empathy and commitment of the professor
   were keystones to good scores. The ``fun-factor{''} was the key for the
   success of the practical assignment. Practical training was regarded as
   fundamental for a sports medicine class. Discussion: Evaluation of the
   new concept as well as a discussion of the current practice to teach
   sports medicine at medical school confirm the need of a more practical
   oriented education, in order to meet the requirements of sports medicine
   in a time with changing self image of sports.}},

Abstract = {{Background, During the last few years, multiple new medical schools have
   emerged in Chile, associated to the constant preoccupation to provide a
   good quality medical care. This created the need to evaluate medical
   training programs and to open a discussion about the attributes that a
   good physician should have. Aim: To evaluate the medical student's
   perception of the ideal medical doctor profile. Material and methods: An
   analytical, descriptive and cross sectional study was designed. Eleven
   second year, 11 third year, nine fourth year, 13 fifth year, 6 sixth
   year and 8 seventh year students were studied. Data collection was
   gathered by focus groups. Codes and triangulation were used for data
   analysis. Results: As attitudes and moral-ethical values, students
   valued the absence of discrimination a listening attitude and empathy,
   Among job related issues, they valued responsibility and punctuality.
   Emotional and legal self-care were valued as self related attitudes.
   Among skills, competences and capacities, a value was given to
   communicational skills, team work and professional easiness. Knowledge
   about medical and non medical topics was appraised. The valued
   attributes among duties and activities were patient diagnosis. treatment
   and education, team leadership and continuous medical training.
   Conclusions: These findings should help to design new curricula for
   medical schools (Rev Med Chile 2006; 134: 947-54).}},

Title = {{Communication skills competencies: definitions and a teaching toolbox}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Doctors' interpersonal and communication skills correlate
   with improved health care outcomes. International medical organisations
   require competency in communication skills. The Accreditation Council
   for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) developed a toolbox for assessing
   this competency and 5 others, yet none initially for teaching these
   skills.
   PURPOSE AND METHODS The original focus in the development of the ACGME
   competencies was evaluation. This paper represents a significant step
   toward defining methods for teaching communication skills competencies.
   A total of 16 medical education leaders from medical schools worldwide,
   participating in the 2003 Harvard Macy Institute Program for Physician
   Educators, worked together to: (1) further define the ACGME competency
   in interpersonal and communication skills; (2) delineate teaching
   strategies for each level of medical education; and (3) create a
   teaching toolbox to integrate communication skills competencies into
   medical curricula. Four subgroups defined subcompetencies, identified
   teaching strategies for undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate medical
   training and brought their work to the larger group. The expanded
   communication competencies and teaching strategies were determined by a
   consensus of the larger group, presented to 80 Harvard Macy Scholars and
   Faculty for further discussion, then finalised by consensus.
   CONCLUSION The teaching toolbox expands the ACGME core communication
   competencies, adds 20 subcompetencies and connects these competencies to
   teaching strategies at each level of medical training. It represents the
   collaboration and consensus of a diverse international group of medical
   education leaders in a variety of medical specialities and institutions,
   all involved in teaching communication skills. The toolbox is applicable
   globally across different settings and specialities, and is sensitive to
   different definitions of health care.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Narrative reviews represent a popular source
   of information for clinicians, especially where the evidence on a given
   subject is sparse and analogies from other fields of medicine may help
   in filling the information gap. Unfortunately, narrative reviews often
   follow less stringent criteria for information selection and appraisal
   than systematic reviews, potentially leading to incomplete or biased
   recommendations. The objective of the present study was to examine the
   quality of the recommendations provided by narrative reviews on how to
   improve patient adherence to pharmacological treatment of unipolar
   depressive disorders.
   Method: We sought to locate all narrative review papers addressing
   adherence to treatment in unipolar depressive disorders. In order to do
   so, we searched Medline and PsychInfo from 1980 to December 2003, using
   the following keywords: review, depressive disorders, treatment,
   dropout, patient compliance and adherence. We inspected the title and
   the abstract, whenever available to identify the relevant reviews and
   obtained a full copy of the publications in this subset, and read the
   articles to identify further relevant reviews. These were in turn copied
   and reviewed, until no further references were found.
   Results and discussion: We identified 23 reviews, providing a total of
   87 recommendations. The most common recommendation was for patient
   education (19 times), patient-physician empathy/alliance (14 times), and
   education of family (nine times). Reviewers' recommendations were based
   on the literature on depression 54 times, and on other medical
   conditions 17 times. A critical appraisal of the evidence base of the
   recommendations showed that randomized controlled trials or
   meta-analyses were quoted to support the recommendations only 23\% of
   the times, while important interventions of proven efficacy in the field
   of depression or in other chronic conditions (e.g. medication clinics,
   training of nurses, psychological treatment, and telephone follow-up)
   were not mentioned.
   Conclusions: Narrative reviews on adherence to pharmacological treatment
   of depressive disorders suffer not only from the limited availability of
   good quality evidence, but also from an incomplete critical appraisal of
   available evidence on interventions both for depression and for other
   chronic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Physician power has been attacked, and tabooed, in legitimate efforts to
   strengthen patients' rights. Yet the structural and symbolic power
   wielded by doctors is what makes good and right healing actions
   possible. Avoiding the power issue contributes to a confusing state,
   where patient trust is faltering and physicians are uncertain about how
   to fulfill the doctor's role with the intellectual tools of mere science
   and technology. I argue that constitutive characteristics of health,
   illness, and the clinical encounter necessitate a prescriptive and
   responsible healing agent who is more than a technocrat, an information
   broker, or a seller. The article proposes clinical leadership as a
   concept offering practical and ethical direction to clinicians,
   education, research, and health policy. Leadership presupposes
   reflective awareness of physicians' structural and symbolic power, and
   is displayed as discerning, empowering improvisations in critical
   situations, based on empathy and willingness to learn from patients. The
   notion of clinical leadership highlights patient vulnerability,
   medicine's ethical core, and the importance of character development in
   medical education.}},

   Results > Ten RCTs and one metaanalysis provided evidence that a
   combination of emotional and cognitive core has a consistently positive
   effect on health outcomes. This effect relies on specific attitudes and
   skills: empathy reassurance, explanation, counseling, influencing
   patients' `health beliefs and expectations, promoting change in behavior
   thoughts or emotions. These con be integrated into 0 specific
   patient-centered opproach to general practice. Medical education must
   provide training in the relational skills needed for effective

Title = {{Improving education on doctor-patient relationships and communication:
   Lessons from doctors who become patients}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{447-453}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Medical education faces challenges in training empathetic
   doctors who have good patient communication skills. The author aimed to
   understand insights that doctors who become patients may gain concerning
   ways to improve doctor-patient relationships and communication in order
   to improve medical education.
   Method From 1999 to 2002, based in New York, the author conducted two
   in-depth, semistructured, two-hour interviews with each of 50 doctors
   who had serious illnesses concerning their overlapping experiences of
   being health care workers and becoming patients. Interviews examined
   their views about these issues and how their perspectives changed as a
   result of patienthood.
   Results
   These doctor-patients questioned whether and to what degree empathy
   could be taught, but nonetheless provided several techniques for
   improving communication with patients related to process and content of
   care. Processes included charting at the bedside rather than at the
   nursing station, acknowledging having kept patients waiting, and
   increasing awareness of nonverbal aspects of care. Content issues
   included communicating directly about taboo topics and being more
   sensitive in discussing ``bad news,{''} adherence, and nonmedical
   concerns.
   Conclusions
   Doctors reported increased sensitivity to patients' experiences and
   empathy in doctor-patient communication. These findings can help in
   teaching doctors to see more clearly that their specific point of view
   differs from that of patients, and can be limiting. This study also
   sheds light on the wide separation between intellectual and experiential
   learning, which needs to be addressed further in medical education and
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Professionalism assessment has become necessary for all
   postgraduate training programs because it is now required for
   accreditation. To validate the novel items we generated to assess
   professionalism, we tested whether residents' ratings of faculty they
   judged as outstanding in professionalism would be distinguishable from
   those they judged as not outstanding.
   Methods: Educators from core clinical disciplines generated 20 items
   assessing professionalism behaviors on a 7-point frequency scale
   anchored by ``always{''} and ``never.{''} Thirty-five Surgical and
   pediatric residents completed the form twice, anonymously rating 1
   faculty member they judged as Outstanding and another they judged as not
   outstanding.
   Results: The residents produced 69 faculty ratings with means that
   differed significantly on all items between the outstanding and
   not-outstanding faculty. The form was highly unidimensional, with the
   primary factor's eigenvalue being 11.5 and Cronbach's alpha being 0.9.7.
   Groups differed most on items, ie, ``listens well,{''} ``inspires
   trust,{''} ``answers questions directly,{''} and ``demonstrates respect
   for all.{''}
   Conclusion: The behaviors that best distinguished clinical faculty
   judged by residents as outstanding professionals were listening,
   trustworthiness, answering directly, and respect. (c) 2006 Excerpta

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Empathy in the medical setting is appreciation of the
   patient's emotions and expression of that awareness to the patient.
   Named as an essential learning objective by the American Association of
   Medical Colleges, empathy is believed to significantly influence patient
   satisfaction, adherence to medical recommendations, clinical outcomes,
   and professional satisfaction. The objective of this study was to
   identify effective strategies to enhance empathy in undergraduate
   medical students.
   DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed for studies that address the
   effectiveness of strategies for teaching empathy to medical students. We
   identified 13 peer-reviewed, English language, qualitative and
   quantitative studies reporting primary data on interventions that aim to
   foster empathy in undergraduate medical students, using Medical Subject
   Heading terms education, medical, undergraduate or student, medical
   crossed with empathy.
   RESULTS: These studies indicate that empathy may be amenable to positive
   change with a range of interventional strategies. Communication skill
   workshops addressing the behavioral dimension of empathy show greatest
   quantitative impact on participants. However, current studies are
   challenged by varying definitions of empathy, small sample sizes, lack
   of adequate control groups, and variation among existing empathy
   measurement instruments.
   CONCLUSION: Given the methodological limitations of the available
   studies, and uncertainty about which dimensions of empathy should be
   addressed, larger studies using validated measurement tools are
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a modified aging game to enhance medical students'
   attitudes toward caring for elderly patients, enhance empathy for
   elderly patients, and improve general attitudes toward the elderly.
   Design: Preintervention and postintervention study
   Participants and Setting: All 84 students from 2 first-year medical
   school classes
   Intervention: The aging game takes place over a period of 3 hours with a
   group of 10 to 12 students and 5 to 6 facilitators, and includes
   experiential learning about polypharmacy, medication cost, loss of
   functional status, semi-independent living, and living in a long-term
   care facility.
   Measurements: Scores obtained through a modified Maxwell and Sullivan
   questionnaire, and the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD).
   Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in 6 of the 8
   attitudes toward caring for elderly and a statistically significant
   increase in empathy towards elderly patients following the aging game.
   There was a statistically significant change on 23 out of 32 ASD
   questions. There was no evidence of differences in the scores from
   pre-course to post-course by gender age group, interest in
   Family/Internal Medicine, or prior geriatric experience. Following the
   game, 77 (93\%) of the students said they would take the course if not
   mandatory (P =.0001). A majority stated the aging game added
   significantly (61.5\%) or moderately (37.3\%) to their knowledge and
   skills in patient care for the elderly.
   Conclusion: A simulation experience like the aging game is an effective
   method of increasing the empathy and attitudes toward caring for the
   elderly early in the medical school curriculum. Longitudinal assessment
   of the effect of the aging game in maintaining the positive effect on
   empathy and attitudes toward caring for the elderly and especially in
   clinical practice needs to be done.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The Consultation Quality Index (CQI) is a holistic quality marker for
   GPs based on patient enablement, continuity of the care and consultation
   length.
   Aim
   To evaluate the CQI-2, a new version of the CQI incorporating a process
   measure of GP empathy (the Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure).
   Design of study
   Cross-sectional questionnaire study.
   Setting
   General practice in the west of Scotland.
   Method
   Empathy, enablement, continuity, and consultation length were measured
   in 3044 consultations involving 26 GPs in 26 different practices in the
   west of Scotland. CQI-2 scores were calculated and correlated with
   additional data on GPs' and patients' attitudes. Comparisons were also
   made with the UK-wide data from which the original CQI had been
   calculated.
   Results
   CQI-2 scores were independent of deprivation, access, demographics, and
   case-mix. GPs with lower CQI-2 scores valued empathy and longer
   consultations less than these GPs with higher CQI-2 scores. `Below
   average CQI-2' GPs (those in the bottom 25\%) also felt less valued by
   patients and colleagues. Patients' showed less confidence in and gained
   less satisfaction from these doctors. Data ranges from the study were
   comparable with the UK data ranges used to construct the original CQI.
   Conclusions
   The CQI-2 is a new measure of holistic interpersonal care. In a small
   but representative sample of GPs it appears to differentiate between
   below and above average doctors. CQI-2 scores may reflect important
   aspects of morale, core values and patient-centred care. There may be
   potential for its use as part of professional development and as a
   component of the general medical services contract.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To describe and discuss Year 5 medical students' perceptions
   of their own learning about the doctor-patient relationship.
   METHODS We carried out a qualitative study of semi-structured interviews
   with 16 Year 5 medical students using 3-way analysis at the School of
   Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   RESULTS For experiences at the pre-clinical stage, the subcategories
   were: positive aspects of the medical psychology course; great distance
   between theory and reality, and strong desire for clinical practice. For
   experiences at the clinical stage, the subcategories were: demand for
   opportunities to discuss the doctor-patient relationship; teachers as
   either role models or anti-models; clinical situations favourable for
   developing empathic relationships, and clinical situations unfavourable
   for developing empathic relationships. For views about future
   experiences, the subcategories were: apprehension about ethical
   behaviour; anxiety about handling patients' psychosocial
   characteristics, and fear of professional ethics cases or legal action.
   DISCUSSION To compensate for the lack of practical activities during the
   pre-clinical stage, students search for extracurricular activities that
   often overload them. Because teachers function as professional role
   models, their attitudes towards patients have great importance. Students
   fear not being able to maintain their empathic capacity in the future
   because of work-related issues. Knowledge of the psychological aspects
   of the doctor-patient relationship helps students to comprehend their
   experiences. Gradual contact between student and medical practice from
   the beginning of the course is advised. It should be followed by
   interdisciplinary discussions that deal with the technical aspects of
   cases and the doctor-patient relationship.}},

Abstract = {{We incorporated the views of patients to develop a comprehensive set of
   ideal physician behaviors. Telephone interviews were conducted in 2001
   and 2002 with a random sample of 192 patients who were seen in 14
   different medical specialties of Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz, and
   Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Interviews focused on the
   physician-patient relationship and lasted between 20 and 50 minutes.
   Patients were asked to describe their best and worst experiences with a
   physician in the Mayo Clinic system and to give specifics of the
   encounter. The interviewers independently generated and validated 7
   ideal behavioral themes that emerged from the interview transcripts. The
   ideal physician is confident, empathetic, humane, personal, forthright,
   respectful, and thorough. Ways that physicians can incorporate clues to
   the 7 ideal physician behaviors to create positive relationships with
   patients are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Observation, including identification of key pieces of
   data, pattern recognition, and interpretation of significance and
   meaning, is a key element in medical decision making. Clinical
   observation is taught primarily through preceptor modelling during the
   all-important clinical years. No single method exists for communicating
   these skills, and medical educators have periodically experimented with
   using arts-based training to hone observational acuity. The purpose of
   this qualitative study was to better understand the similarities and
   differences between arts-based and clinical teaching approaches to
   convey observation and pattern recognition skills.
   METHOD A total of 38 Year 3 students participated in either small group
   training with clinical photographs and paper cases ( group 1), or small
   group training using art plus dance ( group 2), both consisting of 3
   2-hour sessions over a 6-month period.
   FINDINGS Students in both conditions found value in the training they
   received and, by both self- and instructor-report, appeared to hone
   observation skills and improve pattern recognition. The clinically based
   condition appeared to have been particularly successful in conveying
   pattern recognition concepts to students, probably because patterns
   presented in this condition had specific correspondence with actual
   clinical situations, whereas patterns in art could not be generalised so
   easily to patients. In the arts-based conditions, students also
   developed skills in emotional recognition, cultivation of empathy,
   identification of story and narrative, and awareness of multiple
   perspectives.
   CONCLUSION The interventions studied were naturally complementary and,
   taken together, can bring greater texture to the process of teaching
   clinical medicine by helping us see a more complete `picture' of the
   patient.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The authors describe a longitudinal third- and fourth-year elective,
   `The Art of Doctoring, introduced in an attempt to counteract perceived
   frustration and cynicism in medical students at their home institution
   during the clinical years. The course goals aimed at helping students to
   develop self-reflective skills; improve awareness of and ability to
   modify personal attitudes and behaviors that compromise patient care;
   increase altruism, empathy and compassion toward patients; and sustain
   commitment to patient care, service and personal well-being. These goals
   were accomplished through introduction and development of five skill
   sets: learning from role models and peers; on-site readings of works by
   medical student- and physician-authors; self- and other-observation;
   self-reflective techniques; and case-based problem-solving. The course
   involved regular in-class exercises and homework assignments, as well as
   a personal project related to improving personal compassion, caring and
   empathy toward patients. Students also learned to use a coping algorithm
   to approach problematic clinical and interpersonal situations. Class
   discussions revealed three issues of recurring importance to students:
   loss of idealism, non-compliant patients, and indifferent, harsh or
   otherwise unpleasant attendings and residents. Quantitative and
   qualitative student evaluations overall indicated a generally favorable
   response to the course. Problems and barriers included attendance
   difficulties and van. able levels of student engagement. Future
   directions for this type of educational intervention are considered, as
   well as its implications for medical education.}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The concept of ``emotional intelligence'' has been extensively
   popularized in the lay press and corporate world as individuals purport
   the potential ability of emotional intelligence to predict various
   markers of success. Emotional intelligence (EI) most commonly
   incorporates concepts of emotional expression and regulation,
   self-awareness, and empathy. The concept has been criticized by some for
   its loose definition and parallels to personality traits. Additionally,
   several limitations to the instruments used to measure emotional
   intelligence have been identified. This review examines the foundations
   of the definitions of emotional intelligence as well as existing
   educational research involving emotional intelligence, both within the
   health professions and externally. Recommendations for future research
   and research potential are discussed.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{E214-E219}},
Abstract = {{Selection of suitable students into graduate medical and specialist
   health professional courses can be difficult. Historically, selection of
   students was primarily based on prior academic performance. Recently,
   however, more emphasis has been placed on considering broader academic
   backgrounds and personal characteristics and attitudes of students, but
   no reliable measurement tool is available to predict student success and
   satisfaction with their choice of profession. The aim of this study was
   to survey practising radiation therapists in Australia to seek their
   opinions regarding suitable selection criteria for graduate entry
   radiation therapy (RT) students in order to optimize selection
   procedures for future applicants. Four hundred questionnaires were sent
   to nine RT centres in three states within Australia. All nine clinics
   participated in the survey and 189 questionnaires were returned. Results
   show that the majority of radiation therapists place a high level of
   importance upon a sound knowledge of physics and mathematics, as well as
   life experience, and agree that a visit to an RT clinic plus an
   interview comprise important components of the selection process.
   Humanities, psychology and a psychometric test were not viewed as
   essential entry requirements. Experienced radiation therapists placed
   less value on academic performance in the primary degree and were more
   likely to include an interview as a selection criterion than junior
   practitioners. Empathy for patients was identified as the most important
   personal attribute. It is thus recommended that not only cognitive but
   also personal skills be evaluated during the selection of prospective
   radiation therapists.}},

Abstract = {{How to train competent and compassionate physicians has assumed a new
   urgency. The authors propose that these concerns be approached by
   radically restructuring the medical school curriculum in ways that place
   facts and skills within the context of ethics and values. Doing so will
   require that the positivist stance of medical education be coupled to
   strategies that deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, communication and
   empathy, and, most important, physician self-awareness. Achieving such
   balance will require fundamental change in medicine's education
   philosophy along five general lines: (1) assertion of medical ethics as
   the foundation of clinical medicine; (2) recognition of the central
   place of values in clinical decision making; (3) cultivation of the
   ethos of humane care; (4) selection of medical students with the dual
   capacities of strong cognitive skills and empathy; and (5) encouragement
   and support of faculty who can transmit the knowledge of clinical
   science coupled to the principles of humane care.
   Such changes are both timely and necessary. Although they will be
   difficult to accomplish, they offer an opportunity for medical educators
   to foster the development of physicians with the range attributes that
   this new century demands.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale for study - The American Veterinary Medical Association's
   policy states that veterinarians are obliged to promote good animal
   welfare. In order to establish how compatible the attitudes of future
   veterinarians in one North American Veterinary College were with the
   promotion of good animal welfare, students were surveyed with respect to
   their opinions about the humaneness of commonly employed agricultural
   procedures (e.g., hot branding) and their beliefs about the cognitive
   ability of various domesticated species.
   Methodology - A Web-based questionnaire was made available to all
   veterinary students at Cornell University. Descriptive summary data were
   collected with regards to students' perceptions of the cognitive
   abilities of six different domesticated species. Students were also
   asked if they considered certain agricultural procedures to be humane
   for each of these species. The data were analyzed with respect to
   students' future career goals. Chi-squared tests and nonparametric
   statistical techniques were used to examine differences between species
   and desired career goals.
   Results and Conclusions - Veterinary students were more likely to
   believe that dogs and cats had cognitive abilities than farm animals
   did. Students considered various procedures to be more humane for farm
   mammals than for dogs and cats. Students aspiring to work with food
   animals considered more procedures to be humane for all species than did
   students aspiring to work with small animals. The inconsistency of
   students' attitudes for different species has implications for
   veterinary education and animal welfare. Scientific fields integral to
   understanding animal welfare may need to be emphasized within the
   veterinary educational curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{At least 40 to 60 percent of women and at least 20 percent of men with
   chronic pain disorders report a history of being abused during childhood
   and/or adulthood. This incidence of abuse is two to four times higher
   than in the general population. Patients with more severe or frequent
   abuse, usually during childhood and worse if sexual in nature. often
   develop specific syndromes or combinations of syndromes. These syndromes
   include posttraumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia, and other
   conditions characterized by repression, somatization, and increased
   utilization of medical care. Psychosomatic symptoms and dysfunctional
   behaviors may emerge as these patients seek attention and validation of
   their suffering, while paradoxically repressing painful memories of
   trauma. Behavioral observations and key features of the physical
   examination may greatly help the clinician identify both the presence
   and severity of psychosomatic disease. In addition, it is very
   interesting that various studies document physiologic changes in the
   brains of patients with a history of abuse and in patients with a
   diagnosis of fibromyalgia. These studies suggest that abuse may
   physiologically and developmentally increase a person's susceptibility
   to pain and that some organic changes may be associated with psychogenic
   disease.
   Diagnosis and treatment of even the most challenging patients with
   chronic pain is much more effective if it includes (a) careful inquiry
   about any history of past or present abuse or other severe trauma, (b)
   empathy and constructive validation of disease and suffering, (c)
   recognition of dysfunctional pain behaviors and personality traits, (d)
   documentation of nonanatomic as well as anatomic features on
   examination, (e) multidisciplinary treatments including psychotherapy
   whenever indicated, and (1) noninvasive procedures and alternatives to
   potentially habit-forming medications whenever possible and appropriate.
   Furthermore, it has been shown that helping patients gain insight about
   the relationship between abuse and their current symptoms leads to
   decreased health care utilization. Practical guidelines are provided for
   identifying psychopathology, communicating effectively, and achieving
   better treatment outcomes for these unfortunate patients.}},

Title = {{Patient participation in medical consultations - Why some patients are
   more involved than others}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients vary in their willingness and ability to actively
   participate in medical consultations. Because more active patient
   participation contributes to improved health outcomes and quality of
   care, it is important to understand factors affecting the way patients
   communicate with healthcare providers.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to examine the extent to
   which patient participation in medical interactions is influenced by 1)
   the patient's personal characteristics (age, gender, education,
   ethnicity); 2) the physician's communication style (eg, use of
   partnership-building and supportive talk); and 3) the clinical setting
   (eg, the health condition, medical specialty).
   Research Design and Subjects: The authors conducted a post hoc
   cross-sectional analysis of 279 physician-patient interactions from 3
   clinical sites: 1) primary care patients in Sacramento, California, 2)
   patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the San Francisco
   Bay area, and 3) patients with lung cancer from a VA hospital in Texas.
   Main Outcome Measures: The outcome measures included the degree to which
   patients asked questions, were assertive, and expressed concerns and the
   degree to which physicians used partnership-building and supportive talk
   (praise, reassurance, empathy) in their consultations.
   Results: The majority of active participation behaviours were
   patient-initiated (84\%) rather than prompted by physician
   partnership-building or supportive talk. Patients who were more active
   participants received more facilitative communication from physicians,
   were more educated, and were more likely to be white than of another
   ethnicity. Women more willingly expressed negative feelings and
   concerns. There was considerable variability in patient participation
   across the 3 clinical settings. Female physicians were more likely to
   use supportive talk than males, and physicians generally used less
   supportive talk with nonwhite compared with white patients.
   Conclusions: Patient participation in medical encounters depends on a
   complex interplay of personal, physician, and contextual factors.
   Although more educated and white patients tended to be more active
   participants than their counterparts, the strongest predictors of
   patient participation were situation-specific, namely the clinical
   setting and the physician's communicative style. Physicians could more
   effectively facilitate patient involvement by more frequently using
   partnership-building and supportive communication. Future research
   should investigate how the nuances of individual clinical settings (eg,
   the health condition, time allotted for the visit) impose constraints or
   opportunities for more effective patient involvement in care.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to describe the experience and expectations of
   Chinese cancer patients with regard to the favorable and unfavorable
   words conveyed by their social support providers. In-depth interviews
   were conducted with 20 patients with cancer using a qualitative
   approach, and the data obtained were analyzed using content analysis.
   The findings indicated that favorable words inspired patients with
   cancer and raised their hopes. Such words included words expressing
   positive confirmation of patients' physical condition and mental status,
   words of encouragement and consolation, discussions of successful cases,
   information about advanced medical techniques and developments,
   practical instructions, emotional support from close relatives,
   confirmation about previous achievements for the family and about one's
   career, as well as small talk to distract the patient. Unfavorable words
   were those that weakened the patients' hopes and self-esteem. They
   included words expressing negative information and pessimistic
   attitudes, those indicating an overprotective attitude on the part of
   close relatives, as well as words expressing commiseration, advice, and
   an underestimation of the patients' suffering without empathy. The
   findings provide guidelines for nurses to communicate with patients with
   cancer verbally in a Chinese cultural context, and outline strategies
   for communication to meet psychologic needs of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To relate prospectively initial consultation
   characteristics-length, empathy, and patient enablement-with perceived
   health changes in patients going to the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital
   (GHH).
   Methods: Consecutive outpatients completed the Consultation and
   Relational Empathy (CARE) measure and the Patient Enablement Instrument
   (PEI) immediately after their first consultations, again at 3 months,
   and the PEI also at 12 months. The Short Form-12 was completed
   immediately before and the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome (MYMOP)
   Profile during the first consultation, and both were repeated at 3 and
   12 months. Perceived changes in main complaint and well-being were
   assessed using the Glasgow Homoeopathic Outcome Scale (GHHOS).
   Results: Empathy score at first consultation was highly predictive of
   ongoing empathy score at 3 months (Spearman's rho, 0.572, p < 0.0001).
   Empathy scores at first consultation also correlated significantly with
   enablement score at first consultation (rho, 0.325, p < 0.0001) and
   overall enablement at 12 months (rho, 0.281; p < 0.05). Controlling for
   the number of subsequent consultations, initial empathy scores were also
   predictive of change in main complaint, and general well-being, at 3
   months (rho, 0.225, 0.213 respectively; p < 0.05). Enablement score at
   first consultation also predicted overall enablement at 3 months (rho,
   0.255; p < 0.05) and 12 months (rho, 0.282; p < 0.05). Initial
   enablement predicted GHOSS well-being score at 3 months after
   controlling for number of consultations (rho, 0.279; p < 0.05). Both
   empathy and enablement at 3 months predicted overall enablement at 12
   months (rho, 0.327; p < 0.01 and rho, 0.577; p < 0.0001, respectively).
   Empathy at 3 months was not significantly related to GHHOS scores at 12
   months, whereas enablement scores at 3 months were highly predictive of
   both GHHOS main complaint and well-being scores at 12 months (rho, 0.459
   and 0.507, respectively; p < 0.0001). Empathy and enablement scores did
   not correlate significantly with changes in SF-12 and MYMOP scores at
   any of the time points. The length of the first consultation was related
   to initial and subsequent CARE scores, overall enablement, and GHHOS
   scores at 3 and 12 months.
   Conclusions: Empathy is crucial for enablement, which, in turn, is
   strongly related to perceived change in main complaint and well-being.
   The length of time the clinician spends with a patient at initial
   consultation appears to be an important factor in these complex
   relationships among process and outcome.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Most continuing medical education programs on intimate
   partner violence (IPV) use an expert-driven approach and focus on
   changing knowledge and screening behaviors. The Voices of Survivors
   program aims to also improve attitudes and empathy.
   OBJECTIVES: To test the Attitudes Toward Survivors of IPV (ATSI) survey
   psychometrically. To assess the effectiveness of the Voices of Survivors
   program in changing health care workers' responsibility to assess for
   and counsel about IPV, respect for patient autonomy, empathy toward
   patients in abusive relationships, barriers, confidence, knowledge, and
   self-reported assessment behaviors.
   SETTING: Thirty-one unaffiliated primary care practices in Washington
   County, Ore.
   DESIGN: Comparison of ATSI survey results before and after a two-hour
   workshop including a 30-minute video and an advocate-led discussion.
   PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of primary care providers, medical
   support staff, and other clinic employees.
   RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-four health care workers participated in
   the training. Two hundred and sixty-seven (94\%) completed workshop
   evaluations and 187 (66\%) completed both pre- and postintervention
   surveys. Cronbach's alpha for all scales ranged from 0.68 to 0.92.
   Postintervention, participants' summary scores improved for
   responsibility to assess for IPV (3.96 vs 3.64; P < .0001), respect for
   patient autonomy (2.78 vs 2.41; P < . 0001), empathy (3.24 vs. 2.99; P =
   .002), confidence (2.33 vs 2.07; P < .0001), knowledge (2.08 vs 1.64; P
   < .0001), and self-reported behaviors (3.08 vs 2.53; P = .0001).
   Barriers related to availability of resources and referrals also
   improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ATSI scales demonstrated good internal reliability and
   responsiveness to change in all domains except responsibility to
   counsel. The Voices of Survivors documentary, along with a workshop
   based on its companion guide, improved clinic employees' knowledge,
   attitudes, empathy, and self-reported assessment behaviors about IPV.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To explore third-year medical students' experiences with death
   and dying patients during the first internal medicine clerkship.
   Method In August 2002, through purposeful sampling, the authors targeted
   for open-ended interviews 32 third-year medical students at the
   University of California, San Francisco in the first core internal
   medicine clerkship. Interviews averaged 45 minutes in length and were
   audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach.
   Results Twenty-eight (87.5\%) students participated in interviews. All
   students encountered death or dying patients, and most cared directly
   for at least one dying patient. Students' relationships with patients
   were characterized by attachment, empathy, and advocacy. Students valued
   preparation by preclinical end-of-life (EOL) courses, but assigned
   greater value to patient care experiences guided by teams that
   acknowledged deaths, role-modeled EOL care, and respected students'
   participation in patient care. Clerkship experiences in EOL care
   affected students' developing professional identities by affording
   opportunities to manage strong emotions, understand the challenges of
   transitioning to residency, and gain a sense of self-efficacy as future
   physicians providing EOL care.
   Conclusions Third-year medical students' experiences with dying patients
   affect their skills and attitudes in EOL care, as well as the emergence
   of their professional identities. The behaviors and attitudes modeled by
   residents and attendings during the clerkships can strongly influence
   students' perceptions of and self-efficacy in EOL care. Further research
   and interventions into how residents and attendings model responses to
   death in the clinical clerkship may suggest strategies not only for EOL
   training, but also for mentoring professional development.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research has shown that people mispredict their own behavior and
   preferences across affective states. When people are in an affectively
   ``cold{''} state, they fail to fully appreciate how ``hot{''} states
   will affect their own preferences and behavior. When in hot states, they
   underestimate the influence of those states and, as a result,
   overestimate the stability of their current preferences. The same biases
   apply interpersonally; for example, people who are not affectively
   aroused underappreciate the impact of hot states on other people's
   behavior. After reviewing research documenting such intrapersonal and
   interpersonal hot-cold empathy gaps, this article examines their
   consequences for medical, and specifically cancer-related, decision
   making, showing, for example, that hot-cold empathy gaps can lead
   healthy persons to expose themselves excessively to health risks and can
   cause health care providers to undertreat patients for pain.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: While resident distress and its potential to negatively
   effect patient care have been well documented, little is known about
   resident well-being or its potential to enhance care.
   OBJECTIVE: We measured resident well-being and explored its relationship
   with empathy.
   DESIGN: Anonymous, cross-sectional survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: Internal medicine residents at Mayo Clinic Rochester (n =
   165, summer 2003).
   MEASUREMENTS: Well- being was measured using the previously validated
   Medical Outcomes Study 8-item Short Form (SF-8). Empathy was measured
   using the previously validated Perspective Taking (PT) and Empathetic
   Concerns (EC) Sub-scales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).
   RESULTS: Eighty-three (50\%) residents responded to the survey. Mean
   scores for well-being as measured by the SF-8 were comparable to the
   general population, and empathy scores on the IRI were similar to other
   resident samples. Resident empathy on both the cognitive (PT) and
   emotive (EC) sub-scales of the IRI was higher for residents with higher
   mental well-being on the SF-8; however, this difference was
   statistically significant only for the cognitive sub-scale. The
   importance of a number of personal wellness promotion strategies
   differed for residents with higher mental well-being on the SF-8.
   CONCLUSIONS: High mental well-being was associated with enhanced
   resident empathy in this cross-sectional survey. Future studies need to
   explore the potential for high resident well- being to enhance medical
   care and competency in addition to exploring the negative consequences
   of resident distress. Studies investigating how to promote resident
   well-being are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Escalating health care costs are affecting patients across the country.
   As employers and insurance companies face higher expenses, they may move
   to a cost-sharing strategy, which potentially increases financial
   burdens on patients. In this situation, physicians may find themselves
   serving as both medical and financial advisors for their patients.
   Clinical encounters in which patients experience financial hardship can
   be awkward and frustrating for both parties. Physicians must learn to
   discuss issues of affordability in a manner that builds, rather than
   detracts, from a therapeutic alliance. This article describes our
   experiences using several communication skills that can help in the
   discussion of health care costs with patients. The primary skill,
   empathic communication, which includes ``we{''} statements and ``I wish
   ...{''} statements, serves to create a platform for shared
   decision-making, negotiation, and a search for alternatives. In
   addition, it is helpful if physician offices have resource materials
   available and strategies identified to assist patients facing financial
   hardship.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Although patients with cancer are often accompanied by a
   relative during medical interviews, to the authors' knowledge little is
   known regarding the efficacy of communication skills training programs
   on physicians' communication skills in this context. The objective of
   the current study was to assess the efficacy of 6 consolidation
   workshops, 3 hours in length, that were conducted after a 2.5-day basic
   training program.
   METHODS. After attending the basic training program, physicians were
   assigned randomly to consolidation workshops or to a waiting list.
   Training efficacy was assessed through simulated and actual interviews
   that were recorded on an audio tape at baseline, after consolidation
   workshops for the consolidation-workshops group, and 5 months after the
   end of basic training for the waiting-list group. Communication skills
   were assessed according to the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop
   Evaluation Manual. Patients' and relatives' perceptions of and
   satisfaction with physicians' communication performance were assessed
   using a 15-item questionnaire.
   RESULTS. Sixty-two physicians completed the training program. Compared
   with physicians who participated to the basic training program, when
   addressing the patient, physicians who were randomized to the
   consolidation workshops used more open, open directive, and screening
   questions (P = 0.011 in simulated patient interviews and P = 0.005 in
   actual patient interviews) and elicited and clarified psychologic
   concerns more often (P = 0.006 in simulated patient interviews and P <
   0.001 in actual patient interviews). When they addressed the relative,
   physicians who were randomized to the consolidation workshops gave less
   premature information (P = 0.032 in simulated patient interviews and P <
   0.001 in actual patient interviews). When they addressed the patient and
   the relative simultaneously, physicians who were randomized to the
   consolidation workshops used more empathy, educated guesses, alerting to
   reality, confronting, negotiating, and summarizing (P = 0.003 in
   simulated patient interviews and P = 0.024 in actual patient
   interviews). Patients, but not relatives, who interacted with physicians
   in the consolidation-workshops group were more satisfied globally with
   the interviews (P = 0.022).
   CONCLUSIONS. Six 3-hour consolidation workshops resulted in improved
   communication skills addressed to patients and to relatives. The current
   results showed that the transfer of skills addressing relatives'
   concerns remained limited and that consolidation workshops should focus
   even more systematically on the practice of three-person interviews. (c)

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND This project introduced medicine-related poetry and prose to
   a Year 3 family medicine clerkship with the purpose of determining
   students' perception of the usefulness of such materials to enhance
   empathy, improve patient management, and reduce stress. Although
   humanities are represented in the curricula of many medical schools, we
   need more information on how best to incorporate them during the
   clinical years.
   METHOD In 2000, we used a needs assessment survey to identify learner
   perceptions of medical humanities. Using this information, in 2001-03 we
   developed and implemented a humanities-based curriculum consisting of
   readings linked to clinical vignettes, comments about humanities reading
   in required clinical Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP)
   notes, and either station-specific or general poetry accompanying
   student end-of-clerkship objective structured clinical examinations. We
   collected both quantitative and qualitative data assessing student
   reactions and examined the data using non-parametric statistics and
   content analysis, respectively.
   RESULTS Students showed moderate interest in incorporating humanities in
   medical education as a way of enhancing empathy, improving understanding
   and reducing frustration. Assessment of the clerkship humanities
   curriculum suggested a positive influence on students in terms of
   empathy for the patient's perspective, and a lesser, but still positive,
   impact on patient management.
   DISCUSSION Responses from this group of learners suggest that there is
   receptivity toward introducing medical humanities into family medicine
   curricular venues and that such effort can have a generally positive
   effect on learner empathy, awareness and understanding toward patients
   and doctors.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Balint training is used in many family
   medicine residency programs to encourage self-reflection and exploration
   of the physician-patient encounter There is limited objective research,
   however, on outcomes of Balint training. This study's purpose was to
   determine whether Balint training is associated with, differences in
   physician empathy and work satisfaction. Methods: The Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy and a validated survey on physician work satisfaction
   were mailed to 182 graduates of the Medical University of South Carolina
   (MUSC) Family Medicine Residency Program (113 Balint attendees and 69
   nonattendees). The Dillman method of survey design was followed.
   Results: The two groups were not statistically different in demographic
   measures. Balint attendees had a similar mean empathy score (119.4) as
   nonattendees (116.7). There was also no statistically significant
   difference in overall work satisfaction or satisfaction with financial
   compensation. Balint attendees were, however, more likely to say they
   would choose the same specialty if they could choose again than did
   nonattendees (86.1\% versus 55\%). Conclusions: There was no association
   found between Balint training and physician empathy, financial
   satisfaction, or overall work satisfaction. However, physicians who
   completed Balint training at the MUSC Family Medicine Residency Program
   seemed more satisfied with their choice of family medicine as a
   specialty.}},

Title = {{Stories as data, data as stories: making sense of narrative inquiry in
   clinical education}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{534-540}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Narrative inquiry is a form of qualitative research that
   takes story as either its raw data or its product. Science and narrative
   can be seen as two kinds of knowing, reflected in the distinction
   between evidence-based medicine derived from population studies and
   narrative-based medicine focused upon the single case. A similar tension
   exists in the field of narrative inquiry between cognitive-orientated
   analytical methods and affective-orientated methods of synthesis.
   AIMS This paper aims to make sense of narrative inquiry in clinical
   education through definition of `narrative', articulation of a typology
   of narrative research approaches, and critical examination in particular
   of analytical methods, the dominant approach in the literature. The
   typology is illustrated by research examples, and the role of medical
   education in developing expertise in narrative inquiry is discussed. An
   argument is made that the tension between analysis of the structure of
   stories and empathic use of stories can be seen as productive,
   stimulating expertise encompassing both approaches.
   DISCUSSION Analytical methods tend to lose the concrete story and its
   emotional impact to abstract categorisations, which may claim
   explanatory value but often remain descriptive. Stemming from discomfort
   with more integrative methods derived from the humanities, a
   science-orientated medical education may privilege analytical methods
   over approaches of synthesis. Medical education can redress this
   imbalance through attention to `thinking with stories' to gain empathy
   for a patient's experience of illness. Such an approach can complement
   understanding of story as discourse - how narratives may be used
   rhetorically to manage both social interactions and identity.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To review the relevant literature regarding the predictive
   ability of cognitive measures (ie, Pharmacy College Admissions Test
   {[}PCAT] scores and prepharmacy grade point average {[}GPA]) on both
   academic and clinical performance and discuss the inclusion of
   nontraditional assessment during the admissions process.
   DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified through searches of International
   Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2004), MEDLINE (1966-January 2004),
   and ERIC (1966-April 2004) using the key words admissions variables,
   predictors of success, Pharmacy College Admissions Test, grade point
   average, cognitive variables, and noncognitive variables.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and
   retrospective studies, as well as reviews, regarding pharmacy school and
   other higher education admissions' variables were included in this
   review.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Many pharmacy school admissions committees give a
   majority weight to the traditional cognitive markers of prepharmacy GPA
   and PCAT scores when selecting viable applicants. Doing so may be
   problematic due to the magnitude of the relationship between traditional
   cognitive predictors and pharmacy school performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review, a cogent argument is advanced for the
   need to examine, in addition to PLAT scores and GPAs, such
   nontraditional factors as empathy, citizenship, and ethical behavior.
   This may increase the predictive ability of preadmission factors on
   pharmacy school didactic and clinical performance. Schools of pharmacy
   can do this through questionnaires and interviews designed to assess
   nontraditional variables.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy should characterize all health care professions. Despite
   advancement in medical technology, the healing relationship between
   physicians and patients remains essential to quality care. We propose
   that physicians consider empathy as emotional labor (ie, management of
   experienced and displayed emotions to present a certain image). Since
   the publication of Hochschild's The Managed Heart in 1983, researchers
   in management and organization behavior have been studying emotional
   labor by service workers, such as flight attendants and bill collectors.
   In this article, we focus on physicians as professionals who are
   expected to be empathic caregivers. They engage in such emotional labor
   through deep acting (ie, generating empathy-consistent emotional and
   cognitive reactions before and during empathic interactions with the
   patient, similar to the method-acting tradition used by some stage and
   screen actors), surface acting (ie, forging empathic behaviors toward
   the patient, absent of consistent emotional and cognitive reactions), or
   both. Although deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface
   acting when immediate emotional and cognitive understanding of patients
   is impossible. Overall, we contend that physicians are more effective
   healers-and enjoy more professional satisfaction-when they engage in the
   process of empathy. We urge physicians first to recognize that their
   work has an element of emotional labor and, second, to consciously
   practice deep and surface acting to empathize with their patients.
   Medical students and residents can benefit from long-term regular
   training that includes conscious efforts to develop their empathic
   abilities. This will be valuable for both physicians and patients facing
   the increasingly fragmented and technological world of modern medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Clinician-parent conversations in perinatology and neonatology are
   demanding. They take place over a period of time and ask much of the
   clinician. Many parents insist that they want thorough explanations so
   they can understand the medical information and its impact on them.
   These cases involve copious amounts of medical and resource information
   and parents cannot assimilate it all at one time; thus, these
   conversations are extended dialogs. Conversational skills that seem
   essential for clinicians in this work include giving bad news, sharing
   information, and expressing empathy. Underlying the conversational
   skills are those habits that form the complete physician: curiosity that
   leads one to learn the parents' values; the skill to help parents apply
   these values as they make difficult decisions; patience to listen to and
   stick with these suffering people who are full of strong emotions; and
   finally, the courage and endurance to confront these difficult
   situations day after day.}},

Abstract = {{Music is widely used to enhance well-being, reduce stress, and distract
   patients from unpleasant symptoms. Although there are wide variations in
   individual preferences, music appears to exert direct physiologic
   effects through the autonomic nervous system. It also has indirect
   effects by modifying caregiver behavior. Music effectively reduces
   anxiety and improves mood for medical and surgical patients, for
   patients in intensive care units and patients undergoing procedures, and
   for children as well as adults. Music is a low-cost intervention that
   often reduces surgical, procedural, acute, and chronic pain. Music also
   improves the quality of life for patients receiving palliative care,
   enhancing a sense of comfort and relaxation. Providing music to
   caregivers may be a cost-effective and enjoyable strategy to improve
   empathy, compassion, and relationship-centered care while not increasing
   errors or interfering with technical aspects of care.}},

Abstract = {{The medical humanities are concerned with ``the science of the
   human{''}, and bring the perspectives of disciplines such as history,
   philosophy, literature, art and music to understanding health, illness
   and medicine.
   The medical humanities are designed to overcome the separation of
   clinical care from the ``human sciences{''} and to foster
   interdisciplinary teaching and research to optimise patient care.
   Medical humanities have become part of the mainstream in medical
   education in North America and the United Kingdom, and are now
   integrated into many medical curricula in Australia.

Abstract = {{The need for physicians to have patient-centered communication skills is
   reflected in the educational objectives of numerous medical schools'
   curricula and in the competencies required by groups such as the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. An innovative
   method for teaching communications skills has been developed at the
   University of Colorado School of Medicine as part of its three-year,
   longitudinal course focusing on basic clinical skills required of all
   physicians. The method emphasizes techniques of open-ended inquiry,
   empathy, and engagement to gather data. Students refer to the method as
   ILS, or Invite, Listen, and Summarize. ILS was developed to combat the
   high-physician-control interview techniques, characterized by a series
   of ``yes{''} or ``no{''} questions. The authors began teaching the ILS
   approach in 2001 as one basic exercise and have since developed a
   two-year longitudinal communications curriculum. ILS is easy to use and
   remember, and it emphasizes techniques that have been shown in other
   studies to achieve the three basic functions of the medical interview:
   creating rapport, collecting good data, and improving compliance. The
   skills are taught using standardized patients in a series of four
   small-group exercises. Videotaped standardized patient encounters are
   used to evaluate the students. Tutors come from a variety of disciplines
   and receive standardized training. The curriculum has been well
   received. Despite the fact that the formal curriculum only occurs in the
   first two years, there is some evidence that it is improving students'
   interviewing skills at the end of their third year.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The objective of this study is to evaluate women's
   priorities and preferences in selecting their obstetrician and
   gynecologist in a non-Western society.
   Methods. Consecutive sample of 508 patients attending the obstetric and
   gynecologic services of AL-Ain Hospital; AL-Ain; United Arab Emirates
   during 4 months was recruited. Participants were interviewed by using a
   structured 26-item questionnaire administered by means of face-to-face
   interview within 24 h of admission in the ward or before consultation in
   the outpatient clinic. Respondents were asked about their preferences,
   priorities, determinants of choice of their obstetrician and
   gynecologist, their view of his/her role as a medical provider, and
   their perception of importance of each of provider's characteristics and
   roles on a five-point Likert scale.
   Results. Four hundred thirty-nine (86.4\%) participants preferred female
   physicians. Sixty-one (12\%) had no preference and eight (1.6\%)
   preferred male physicians. Reasons for female selection were privacy
   during intimate examination (89.1\%) or counseling (68.8\%), religious
   beliefs (74.3\%), and cultural traditions (45.3\%). Female preference
   was significantly associated with higher parity (P = 0.002), religion (P
   = 0.005), nationality (P = 0.01), occupation (P = 0.02), education (P =
   0.04), and poor recognition of physician's role as professional/expert
   (P < 0.00001). Male preference was significantly associated with
   experience at previous encounter (P = 0.03), obstetric consultation (P =
   0.04), and perceiving physician's role as skilled communicator (P =
   0.01) or health educator (P = 0.04). Other physician characteristics
   affecting choice were professionalism, bedside manners, empathy,
   communication, competence, availability, and religion.
   Conclusions. Physician's attitude, professional profile, sex, and
   religious faith determine women's choice of obstetricians and
   gynecologists. Most women prefer female providers because of
   embarrassment during pelvic examination and reproductive counseling,
   religious beliefs, and sociocultural values.}},

Abstract = {{The current health care system in the United States must shift from a
   primary focus on acute care and cure to also emphasize maintenance of
   function and the relief of suffering that derives from the ailments
   associated with chronic disease and illness. To achieve this goal, the
   individual components of the health care equation must all respond and
   work in concert. These components include the provider, the venue, the
   patient, the community, our society, and the fiscal realities of paying
   for care. However, the barrier for change stems from the marked
   heterogeneity that exists in the definition of each of these individual
   components. Thus, the fundamental question is, can our current and
   future medical care system respond to the imperative of focusing on
   heating with a particular emphasis on chronic diseases? A solution is
   the provision of individualized care in a mindful practice and the
   purposeful cultivation of a healing relationship suffused with
   compassion and empathy in the therapeutic alliances between patient,
   provider, and advocates.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Professionalism is an important topic in medical education
   today. While much work has focused on defining professionalism and
   teaching medical students the appropriate interpersonal behaviours,
   relatively little research has looked at meaningful ways of assessing
   the relevant attributes.
   METHOD The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates
   (ECFMG(R)) clinical skills assessment (CSA(R)) uses standardised
   patients (SPs) to evaluate the readiness of graduates of international
   medical schools to enter accredited graduate training programmes in the
   USA. Doctor interpersonal skills, including professional qualities such
   as rapport, are evaluated as part of the CSA. Attentiveness, attitude
   and empathy, all facets of professional behaviour, are specifically
   targeted as part of the assessment.
   RESULTS To date, over 35 000 candidates have been assessed, encompassing
   more than 370 000 individual SP encounters. Based on a I-year cohort of
   examinees, the reliability of the individual professionalism-related
   component scores ranged from 0.61 to 0.70. Doctors who had graduated
   from medical school more recently, or were younger, generally obtained
   higher ratings. Professional qualities were only marginally related to
   measures of basic science and clinical science proficiency. Female
   candidates were rated significantly higher than male candidates on all
   dimensions.
   CONCLUSIONS While some professional behaviours are probably best
   measured using formats such as surveys, self-assessment and critical
   incident techniques, certain aspects of the domain can be reliably and
   Validly measured in SP examinations.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-49}},

Abstract = {{Background. There is interest in the use of ``standardized patients{''}
   to assist in evaluating medical trainees' clinical skills, which may be
   difficult to evaluate with written exams alone. Previous studies of the
   validity of observed structured clinical exams have found low
   correlation with various written exams as well as with faculty
   evaluations. Since die United States Medical Licensing Examination
   (USMLE) results are often used by training programs in the selection of
   applicants. we assessed the correlation between performance on an
   observed structured clinical exam and the USMLE, steps 1 and 2. for
   internal medicine housestaff.
   Methods: We collected scores on the USMLE, steps I and 2, and the
   overall score from a required standardized patient encounter for all
   PGY-1 trainees, in a single urban teaching hospital. Pearson
   coefficients were used to compare the USMILE and observed structured
   clinical exam performance.
   Results: The two steps of the USMLE correlated with each other to a
   large extent (r=0.65 2 df=30: p=0.0001). However. both steps of the
   USMILE correlated poorly with the observed structured clinical exam step
   1 r=0.2, df=32, p=0.27; step 2 r=0.09, df=30 p=0.61).
   Conclusions: The low correlation between the USMLE and performance on a
   structured clinical exam suggests that either the written exam is a poor
   predictor of actual clinical performance, the small window of clinical
   skills measured by the structured clinical exam is inadequate, or the
   two methods evaluate different skill sets entirely. Our findings are
   consistent with previous work finding low correlations between
   structured clinical exams and accepted common means of evaluation. such
   as faculty evaluations. other written exams and program director
   assessments. The medical education community needs to develop an
   objective. valid method of measuring important, yet subjective,
   skill-sets such as interpersonal communication, empathy and efficient
   data collection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The attitudes of health-care professionals and medical
   students towards male and female homosexuality are of practical
   relevance and have increasingly become a topic of scientific research.
   Comparative investigations between medical students and other student
   groups have not yet been conducted.
   Objectives: To assess the attitudes of Austrian medical students towards
   homosexuality and to compare these with the attitudes of students of
   politics and veterinary medicine.
   Methods: Students of medicine (122), politics (145), and veterinary
   medicine (153) completed a questionnaire consisting of validated
   instruments assessing anti-homosexual attitudes, items assessing
   knowledge on homosexual issues, and basic demographic information.
   Results: Participants' attitudes were predominantly positive. For all
   instruments, two-way analyses of covariance revealed significant
   influences of participants' sex and study major: students of medicine
   and veterinary medicine held more negative attitudes than students of
   politics, and males were more prejudiced than females. Overall,
   attitudes towards male and female homosexuality were balanced, but male
   students of politics and veterinary medicine were more prejudiced
   towards male than female homosexuality. A significant influence of
   participants' sex (favoring females) was observed in knowledge of
   homosexual issues.
   Conclusions: Although neutrality and empathy are considered vital in the
   doctor-patient relationship, medical students revealed more negative
   attitudes than students of politics did, the latter's attitudes being
   similar to those of students of veterinary medicine. These findings
   suggest that educational and correcting interventions are required in
   medical training.}},

Abstract = {{Southern Illinois University School of Medicine recently completed its
   fourth year of a resource-session-enhanced, case-based,
   tutor-group-oriented curriculum. As an example of a curricular unit, the
   authors describe the implementation of the basic and clinical sciences
   in one of the four units in year one, and detail that unit's
   organization, logistics, content, rationale, and other characteristics.
   The Sensorimotor Systems and Behavior (SSB) unit is preceded by a
   cardio-respiratory-renal unit and is followed by an
   endocrine-reproductive-gastrointestinal unit. A Doctoring unit
   temporally spans each of these three units. The SSB unit is allotted an
   11.5-week period that includes an aggregate of 2.5 weeks of available
   clinical time, 1.5 weeks for examinations and exam study time, and
   approximately 8.5 weeks for tutor-group sessions, mandatory laboratory
   sessions, and self-directed learning. Optional resource sessions are
   offered during a two- to four-hour block on a single morning each week.
   Clinical training in the SSB unit augments self-directed, laboratory,
   and tutor-group learning of neuroscience, gross anatomy, cell biology,
   physiology, biochemistry, behavioral and social science, embryology,
   limited pharmacology and genetics, and basic clinical neurology for
   first-year students. Although it is fast-paced and places heavy
   responsibility for independent learning on the students, the SSB unit
   culminates in significant achievement in the basic and clinical
   sciences. The unit provides substantial clinical training and practical
   experience in physical and neurological examinations that directly
   integrate with basic science knowledge. The unit reduces lecture-based
   instruction, demands self-determination, and promotes experience in team
   effort, professionalism, peer interaction, empathy in clinical medicine,
   and practical use of basic science knowledge.}},

Title = {{The biopsychosocial model 25 years later: Principles, practice, and

Journal = {{ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The biopsychosocial model is both a philosophy of clinical care and a
   practical clinical guide. Philosophically, it is a way of understanding
   how suffering, disease, and illness are affected by multiple levels of
   organization, from the societal to the molecular. At the practical
   level, it is a way of understanding the patient's subjective experience
   as an essential contributor to accurate diagnosis, health outcomes, and
   humane care. In this article, we defend the biopsychosocial model as a
   necessary contribution to the scientific clinical method, while
   suggesting 3 clarifications: (1) the relationship between mental and
   physical aspects of health is complex-subjective experience depends on
   but is not reducible to laws of physiology; (2) models of circular
   causality must be tempered by linear approximations when considering
   treatment options; and (3) promoting a more participatory
   clinician-patient relationship is in keeping with current Western
   cultural tendencies, but may not be universally accepted. We propose a
   biopsychosocial-oriented clinical practice whose pillars include (1)
   self-awareness; (2) active cultivation of trust; (3) an emotional style
   characterized by empathic curiosity; (4) self-calibration as a way to
   reduce bias; (5) educating the emotions to assist with diagnosis and
   forming therapeutic relationships; (6) using informed intuition; and (7)
   communicating clinical evidence to foster dialogue, not just the
   mechanical application of protocol. In conclusion, the value of the
   biopsychosocial model has not been in the discovery of new scientific
   laws, as the term ``new paradigm{''} would suggest, but rather in
   guiding parsimonious application of medical knowledge to the needs of
   each patient.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the factors affecting the
   timing of psychiatric consultations and length of stay in the current
   managed care era. It also assessed the relationships between the timing
   of consultations and demographic/clinical characteristics. Medical
   records of 541 consecutive psychiatric consultation patients at a
   university teaching hospital in 2001 were reviewed for demographic
   characteristics, lengths of stay, number of days from admission to
   consultation, specialty services requesting consultations, reasons for
   the referral given by the referring physicians, and all five axes of
   DSM-IV Earlier consultations independently predicted shorter lengths of
   stay. Delayed consultations were seen more often in women; surgical
   patients; those seen with a request to assess depression; and those seen
   with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder delirium, or no psychiatric
   disorder Delay in psychiatric consultations continues to be associated
   with longer lengths of stay in the current managed care environment. It
   is now possible that early detection strategies for high-risk patients
   with behavioral health problems in the medical setting, such as use of
   the INTERMED, may lead to reduction in delayed psychiatric consultations
   and thus shorter lengths of stay.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify factors that
   predict overall hospital satisfaction with blood suppliers.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The data for this study came from a 2001
   satisfaction survey of hospital blood bank managers conducted by the
   National Blood Data Resource Center. A total of 1325 blood-utilizing
   hospitals were included in the final study database. The measurement of
   hospital satisfaction with its blood supplier encompasses the five
   composites of the SERVQUAL model. The five composites are 1) tangibles,
   2) reliability, 3) responsiveness, 4) assurance, and 5) empathy. Linear
   regression was performed with overall hospital satisfaction as the
   dependent variable and the five composites of the SERVQUAL model and
   control variables as predictors of overall hospital satisfaction with
   blood suppliers.
   RESULTS: Significant predictors of hospital satisfaction with blood
   suppliers are satisfaction with medical and clinical support provided by
   the blood center, satisfaction with the routine delivery schedule, and
   price (service fee) of red cells.
   CONCLUSION: Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of customer
   satisfaction to organizations. As organizations, blood centers can
   benefit from improved satisfaction from their hospital customers. Blood
   center strategies that focus on improving these three predictors of
   overall hospital satisfaction with primary blood suppliers will be the
   most likely to improve and/or maintain hospital customer satisfaction
   with primary blood suppliers.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a problem in older women,
   but older victims of IPV are often unidentified in the medical setting
   because providers think of IPV as a problem of younger women. The
   experiences of older women with IPV are unknown. This study reports on
   the healthcare experiences and needs of older victims of IPV.
   Methods: Interviews were conducted with 38 women > 55 years who
   responded to an advertisement recruiting ``women who had been in an
   abusive relationship since age 55.{''} Interviews were audiotaped,
   transcribed, and analyzed for themes.
   Results: The median age of participants was 58 years ( range 55 - 90).
   The majority were Caucasian with annual incomes over \$40,000. The
   median relationship length was 24 years ( range 2 - 67), and 39\%
   remained in their abusive relationships. About half had discussed IPV
   with a healthcare provider. The themes that were identified included
   disclosure about IPV and both negative and positive experiences with
   healthcare providers. Reasons for nondisclosure were similar to those of
   younger women but were compounded by the generational mores of privacy
   about domestic affairs and society's lack of understanding and resources
   for IPV. Some of the women who disclosed IPV to their providers felt
   discounted and unsupported. Others reported receiving valuable help,
   including empathy, referrals to resources, assistance in naming the
   abuse, linking the stress of IPV to health, and respect for their
   decisions to continue their abusive relationships.
   Conclusions: Older women victims have difficulty initiating discussions
   about IPV with their providers. Providers are encouraged to identify
   signals of potential abuse and to create privacy with all patients to
   discuss difficult issues, such as IPV, and to be knowledgeable about
   appropriate referrals.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of medical students to empathize often declines as they
   progress through the curriculum. This suggests that there is a need to
   promote empathy toward patients during the clinical clerkships. In this
   article, the authors attempt to identify the patient interviewing style
   that facilitates empathy and some practice habits that interfere with
   it.
   The authors maintain that (1) empathy is a multistep process whereby the
   doctor's awareness of the patient's concerns produces a sequence of
   emotional engagement, compassion, and an urge to help the patient; and
   (2) the first step in this process-the detection of the patient's
   concerns-is a teachable skill. The authors suggest that this step is
   facilitated by (1) conducting a ``patient-centered{''} interview,
   thereby creating an atmosphere that encourages patients to share their
   concerns, (2) enquiring further into these concerns, and (3) recording
   them in the section traditionally reserved for the patient's ``chief
   complaint.{''} Some practice habits may discourage patients from sharing
   their concerns, such as (1) writing up the history during patient
   interviewing, (2) focusing too early on the chief complaint, and (3)
   performing a complete system review. The authors conclude that
   sustaining empathy and promoting medical professionalism among medical
   students may necessitate a change in the prevailing interviewing style
   in all clinical teaching settings, and a relocation of a larger
   proportion of clinical clerkships from the hospital setting to primary
   care clinics and chronic care, home care, and hospice facilities, where
   students can establish a continuing relationship with patients.}},

Abstract = {{Breaking the news of the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   (ALS) is a formidable task. To evaluate the process from the perspective
   of patients and caregivers, we surveyed 94 patient-caregiver pairs, as
   well as 50 unpaired patients and 19 unpaired caregivers. We asked
   respondents to evaluate the physician who first broke the news of the
   diagnosis based on the time spent discussing the diagnosis, and six
   attributes of effective communication of bad news derived from the
   SPIKES protocol ( setting, perception, invitation, knowledge, empathy,
   strategy). Fifty-six percent of patients rated the way the physician who
   broke the news as average (30.7), below average (8.6) or poor (16.4).
   Forty-eight percent of caregivers rated the physician as poor (14.4),
   below average (4.8) or average (28.8). Better performance on all
   attributes of effective communication as well as greater time spent
   discussing the diagnosis was correlated with higher patient/caregiver
   satisfaction. Our results suggest that there is room for improvement in
   breaking the news of the diagnosis of ALS. Greater adherence to certain
   attributes of effective communication of bad news may improve the way
   physicians perform this difficult task.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Medical students face many challenges as they progress
   through training, some of which refer to learning how to manage the
   stresses and anxiety of confronting illness and suffering. In trying to
   relieve anxiety, they may develop maladaptive responses that lead to a
   decrease in their level of empathy for patients. Education should aim to
   teach students how to deal with their responses so that they can
   tolerate patients' distress and treat them effectively.
   AIMS This paper will address central dilemmas in students' attitudes
   towards patients during clerkships and suggest positive developmental
   goals to strive for in this formative time. It may be used as a
   reference tool for medical student educators and medical students to
   elucidate the educational tensions in teaching and learning about how to
   provide empathetic care.
   CONCLUSION Students and teachers can benefit from an awareness of the
   tension between the poles of pathology and health, not knowing and too
   much knowing, vulnerability and denial and reaction and inaction.
   Medical students can learn adaptive methods of managing their anxiety
   about dealing with illness and death and strike a balance in their
   approach to patients.}},

Title = {{An empirical study of decline in empathy in medical school}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2004}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT It has been reported that medical students become more cynical
   as they progress through medical school. This can lead to a decline in
   empathy. Empirical research to address this issue is scarce because the
   definition of empathy lacks clarity, and a tool to measure empathy
   specifically in medical students and doctors has been unavailable.
   OBJECTIVE To examine changes in empathy among medical students as they
   progress through medical school.
   MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS A newly developed scale (Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy {[}JSPE], with 20 Likert-type items) was administered
   to 125 medical students at the beginning (pretest) and end (post-test)
   of Year 3 of medical school. This scale was specifically developed for
   measuring empathy in patient care situations and has acceptable
   psychometric properties.
   METHODS In this prospective longitudinal study, the changes in
   pretest/post-test empathy scores were examined by using t-test for
   repeated measure design; the effect size estimates were also calculated.
   RESULTS Statistically significant declines were observed in 5 items (P <
   0.01) and the total sores of the JSPE (P < 0.05) between the 2 test
   administrations.
   CONCLUSIONS Although the decline in empathy was not clinically important
   for all of the statistically significant findings, the downward trend
   suggests that empathy could be amenable to change during medical school.
   Further research is needed to identify factors that contribute to
   changes in empathy and to examine whether targeted educational
   programmes can help to retain, reinforce and cultivate empathy among
   medical students for improving clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to validate the model of empathic
   opportunity (EO) and potential empathic opportunity (PEO) using the
   Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) in a sample of cancer patients.
   Thirty-nine audio taped consultations at an outpatient oncology clinic
   performed by four oncologists were previously coded with the Roter
   Interaction Analysis System for another purpose. These consultations
   were also coded by two raters with the empathic and potential empathic
   opportunity method (E-PE-O method). The reliability of EO and PEO coding
   was satisfactory. Most of the EOs were found within the RIAS category
   ``showing concern{''}. The PEOs were found in both the socio-emotional
   and the instrumental categories of the RIAS. We conclude that the E-PE-O
   method is a good starting point for studying the empathy process in
   oncology consultations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Do global rating forms enable program directors to assess the ACGME
   competencies?}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. In 1999 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
   Education (ACGME) mandated that GME programs require their residents to
   be proficient in six general competencies. The purpose of this study was
   to ascertain whether an existing global rating form could be modified to
   assess these competencies.
   Method. A rating form covering 23 skills described in the ACGME
   competencies was developed. The directors of 92 specialty and
   subspecialty programs at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and the
   Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia were asked to rate
   residents at the end of the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years.
   Results. Ratings for 1,295 of 1,367 (95\%) residents were available.
   Residents were awarded the highest mean ratings on items tied to
   professionalism, compassion, and empathy. The lowest mean ratings were
   assigned for items related to consideration of costs in care and
   management of resources. Factor analysis indicated that the program
   directors viewed overall competence in two dimensions of medical
   knowledge and interpersonal skills. This factor structure was stable for
   groups of specialties, and residents' gender and training level. Mean
   ratings in each dimension were progressively higher for residents at
   advanced levels of training.
   Conclusion. Global rating forms, the tool that program directors use
   most frequently to document residents' competence, may not be adequate
   to assess the six general competencies. The results are consistent with
   earlier published research indicating that physicians view competence in
   just two broad dimensions, which questions the premise of the six ACGME
   competencies. Further research is needed to validate and measure six
   distinct dimensions of clinical competence.}},
