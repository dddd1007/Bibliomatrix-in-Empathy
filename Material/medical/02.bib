Abstract = {{Background Residents' well-being is essential for both the individual
   physician and the quality of patient care they deliver. Therefore, it is
   important to maintain or possibly enhance residents' well-being. We
   investigated (i) the influence of mind fitness training (MFT) on quality
   of care-related well-being characteristics: work engagement, empathy,
   work satisfaction and stress perception and explored (ii) residents'
   perceptions of MFT.
   Methods A multicenter study was conducted in eight Dutch teaching
   hospitals, from September 2012 to February 2014, using mixed
   methods-that is, quantitative and qualitative approaches to data
   collection and analysis. Eighty-nine surgical residents were invited to
   participate in pre- and post-intervention questionnaire surveys.
   Twenty-two residents participated in MFT and were additionally invited
   to evaluate the training by post-intervention interviews including open
   questions.
   Results At baseline 22 (100 \%) residents in intervention group and 47
   (70.2 \%) residents in control group, and post-intervention 20 (90.9 \%)
   residents in intervention group and 41 (66.1 \%) residents in control
   group completed the questionnaires. In intervention-group, residents'
   specialty satisfaction increased by 0.23 point on 5-point Likert scale
   (95 \% CI 0.23-0.24, P < 0.001) while stress scores decreased by -0.94
   point on 10-point scale (95 \% CI -1.77 to -0.12, P = 0.026). No
   substantial changes were observed in control group. Participation in MFT
   was positively associated with residents' empathy (b = 7.22; 95 \% CI
   4.33-10.11; P < 0.001) and specialty satisfaction scores (b = 0.42; 95
   \% CI 0.18-0.65; P = 0.001). Residents positively evaluated MFT with
   median scores of 6.80 for training design and 7.21 for outcome (10-point
   scale). Residents perceived improvement in focusing skills and reported
   being more aware of their own state of mind and feeling calmer and more
   in control.
   Conclusion Mind fitness training could improve residents' empathy,
   specialty satisfaction, stress perception, and focusing skills, and was
   positively received by surgical residents.}},

Title = {{The anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex are associated with
   avoidance of dental treatment based on prior experience of treatment in
   healthy adults}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fear concerning stressful medical or dental procedures is
   one of the major factors that distance patients from health care. Fear
   and avoidance of dental treatments can be shaped by a patient's prior
   experience with receiving dental procedures or by imagining the
   procedures.
   Methods: We performed two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   experiments to investigate the role of the anterior insula (aINS) and
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which are both critical to
   threat perception, in dental avoidance. Dental avoidance based on both
   prior treatment experience and imagination was assessed using a
   customized questionnaire. In an fMRI task-based study, we investigated
   brain activation in 17 healthy participants when they viewed images
   depicting dental procedures that evoked a moderate degree of fear.
   Region-of-interest analysis was performed to assess the association
   between dental avoidance and aINS as well as dACC activation. In a
   resting state fMRI study, we investigated 18 healthy participants for
   the association between the intrinsic functional connectivity of the
   aINS and dACC and dental avoidance.
   Results: We found that (1) the participants showed a higher activation
   of the right aINS and bilateral dACC when they viewed images of dental
   procedures compared with the brain activation observed when they viewed
   scrambled images (p < 0.05 corrected for small volume and family-wise
   error). (2) The avoidance ratings based on prior experience of dental
   treatment were significantly positively correlated with the activation
   in the right aINS (r = 0.67, p = 0.003), right dACC (r = 0.65, p =
   0.005) and left dACC (r = 0.63, p = 0.007). (3) The intrinsic functional
   connectivity between the aINS and the orbitofrontal cortex was
   positively correlated with the avoidance ratings based on experience
   (uncorrected p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The findings highlight prior experience of dental treatment
   as a predominant factor in shaping patients' avoidance behavior.
   Individual differences in threat perception may play a key role in the
   development of dental avoidance.}},

Title = {{Development and Psychometric Evaluation of an Instrument to Assess
   Cross-Cultural Competence of Healthcare Professionals (CCCHP)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Cultural competence of healthcare professionals (HCPs) is recognized as
   a strategy to reduce cultural disparities in healthcare. However,
   standardised, valid and reliable instruments to assess HCPs' cultural
   competence are notably lacking. The present study aims to 1) identify
   the core components of cultural competence from a healthcare
   perspective, 2) to develop a self-report instrument to assess cultural
   competence of HCPs and 3) to evaluate the psychometric properties of the
   new instrument.
   Methods
   The conceptual model and initial item pool, which were applied to the
   cross-cultural competence instrument for the healthcare profession
   (CCCHP), were derived from an expert survey (n = 23), interviews with
   HCPs (n = 12), and a broad narrative review on assessment instruments
   and conceptual models of cultural competence. The item pool was reduced
   systematically, which resulted in a 59-item instrument. A sample of 336
   psychologists, in advanced psychotherapeutic training, and 409 medical
   students participated, in order to evaluate the construct validity and
   reliability of the CCCHP.
   Results
   Construct validity was supported by principal component analysis, which
   led to a 32-item six-component solution with 50\% of the total variance
   explained. The different dimensions of HCPs' cultural competence are:
   Cross-Cultural Motivation/Curiosity, Cross-Cultural Attitudes,
   Cross-Cultural Skills, Cross-Cultural Knowledge/Awareness and
   Cross-Cultural Emotions/Empathy. For the total instrument, the internal
   consistency reliability was .87 and the dimension's Cronbach's alpha
   ranged from .54 to .84. The discriminating power of the CCCHP was
   indicated by statistically significant mean differences in CCCHP
   subscale scores between predefined groups.
   Conclusions
   The 32-item CCCHP exhibits acceptable psychometric properties,
   particularly content and construct validity to examine HCPs' cultural
   competence. The CCCHP with its five dimensions offers a comprehensive
   assessment of HCPs' cultural competence, and has the ability to
   distinguish between groups that are expected to differ in cultural
   competence. This instrument can foster professional development through
   systematic self-assessment and thus contributes to improve the quality
   of patient care.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Existing research shows that medical students experience high
   levels of distress. The purpose of this study was to understand how
   medical students experience doubt, and how doubt relates to
   distress.Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted among first-year

   2012. Students answered survey questions and participated in focus
   groups about doubt and other forms of distress.Results: Ninety-four
   percent (112) of students responded to the survey, with 49\% reporting a
   moderate or high degree of doubt. Compared to those reporting no or low
   doubt, students with moderate/high doubt were significantly more likely
   to question their purpose and identity, struggle to cope with doubt, and
   experience depression and emotional hardening. Twenty-eight percent of
   students (34/112) participated in focus groups to explore their doubt,
   and three themes emerged: types of doubt, ways of coping with doubt, and
   impact of doubt.Conclusions: Doubt is highly prevalent among first-year
   medical students, affects their identity and purpose, and has positive
   and negative consequences. Doubt among medical students merits awareness
   and further study, as it may be an important mediator of students'
   emerging identity and sense of well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: By juxtaposing literature in signed language interpreting
   with that of spoken language interpreting, we provide a narrative review
   to explore the complexity of emotion management in interpreter-mediated
   medical encounters.
   Methods: We conduct literature search through library databases and
   Google Scholar using varied combinations of search terms, including
   interpreter, emotion, culture, and health care.
   Results: We first examine (a) interpreters' management and performance
   of others' emotions, (b) interpreters' management and performance of
   their own emotions, and (c) impacts of emotion work for healthcare
   interpreters.
   Conclusion: By problematizing the roles and functions of emotion and
   emotion work in interpreter-mediated medical encounters, we propose a
   normative model to guide future research and practices of interpreters'
   emotion management in cross-cultural care.
   Practice implications: Quality and equality of care should serve as the
   guiding principle for interpreters' decision-making about their emotions
   and emotion work. Rather than adopting a predetermined practice,
   interpreters should evaluate and prioritize the various clinical,
   interpersonal, and therapeutic objectives as they consider the best
   practice in managing their own and other speakers' emotions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore inter-rater agreement between reviewers comparing
   reliability and validity of checklist forms that claim to assess the
   communication skills of undergraduate medical students in Objective
   Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs).
   Methods: Papers explaining rubrics of OSCE checklist forms were
   identified from Pubmed, Embase, PsycINFO, and the ProQuest Education
   Databases up to 2013. Included were those studies that report empirical
   validity or reliability values for the communication skills assessment
   checklists used. Excluded were those papers that did not report
   reliability or validity.
   Results: Papers focusing on generic communication skills, history
   taking, physician-patient communication, interviewing, negotiating
   treatment, information giving, empathy and 18 other domains (ICC =
   0.12-1) were identified. Regarding the validity and reliability of the
   communication skills checklists, agreement between reviewers was 0.45.
   Conclusions: Heterogeneity in the rubrics used in the assessment of
   communication skills and a lack of agreement between reviewers makes
   comparison of student competences within and across institutions
   difficult.
   Practice implications: Consideration should be afforded to the adoption
   of a standardized measurement instrument to assess communication skills

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Rates of prostate specific antigen (PSA) test ordering vary among GPs.
   Aim
   To examine whether GPs' risk attitude, level of empathy, and burnout
   status are associated with PSA testing.
   Design and setting
   Register and questionnaire study including 129 solo GPs (active in the
   Central Denmark Region) and 76 672 of their adult male patients with no
   history of or current prostate cancer diagnosis.
   Method
   PSA tests from 2012 were retrieved from a register and classified as
   incident (that is, the first PSA test within 24 months), repeated
   normal, or repeated raised tests. This was merged with information on
   GPs' risk attitudes, empathy, and burnout status from a 2012 survey.
   Results
   Patients registered with a GP with a high score on anxiety caused by
   uncertainty (odds ratio {[} OR] 1.03, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   1.00 to 1.06, P = 0.025) or concern about bad outcomes (OR 1.04, 95\% CI
   = 1.00 to 1.08, P = 0.034) were more likely to have an incident PSA
   test, whereas those registered with a GP with increased tolerance for
   ambiguity were less likely (OR 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.96 to 1.00, P = 0.025).
   Patients registered with a GP reporting high tolerance for ambiguity (OR
   0.96, 95\% CI = 0.94 to 0.99, P = 0.009) or high propensity to
   risk-taking (OR 0.97, 95\% CI = 0.93 to 1.00, P = 0.047) were less
   likely to have a repeated normal PSA test.
   Conclusion
   Various aspects of GPs' risk-taking attitudes were associated with
   patients' probability of having an incident and a repeated normal PSA
   test. The probability of having a repeated raised PSA test was not
   influenced by any of the psychological factors. Burnout and empathy were

Abstract = {{Many claims have been made over recent years for the use of poetry (and,
   more broadly, literature) in the curriculum of medical students. Most
   often, poetry is put forward as having the potential to humanize
   medicine by promoting, for example, empathy, ethical sensitivity, and an
   appreciation for diverging interpretations. While these endpoints are
   all important, this essay uses the experience of a junior doctor
   undertaking a degree in creative writing to consider how the poetic way
   of seeing and thinking differs from clinical thinking, and why that
   might matter. In particular, the author considers the importance in
   medicine of the capacity to not know, as well as the possibilities for a
   deeper understanding of patients offered by thinking in terms of poetic
   voice.}},

Abstract = {{Improving quality of care logically involves optimizing the
   duty-readiness and well-being of the healthcare provider. Medical errors

   experience various degrees of emotional and psychological stresses
   including confusion, loss of confidence, and debilitating anxiety. These
   factors contribute to the alarmingly high rates of professional
   ``burnout,{''} substance abuse, and suicide of healthcare providers as
   well as increase the likelihood of subsequent medical errors. Mindful
   efforts to improve the healthcare culture and develop personal support
   systems can help surgeons become more resilient, provide higher quality
   patient care, and have longer productive professional lives.
   Institutional support systems are also necessary to assist ``second

Abstract = {{Observational skills, honed through experience with the literary and
   visual arts, bring together in a timely manner many of the goals of the
   medical humanities, providing thematic cohesion through the act of
   seeing while aiming to advance clinical skills through a unified
   practice. In an arts observation pedagogy, nature writing serves as an
   apt model for precise, clinically relevant linguistic noticing because
   meticulous attention to the natural world involves scientific precision;
   additionally, a number of visual metaphors employed in medicine are
   derived from close observation of the natural world. Close reading
   reinforces observational skills as part of integrative,
   multidisciplinary clinical practice. Literary precision provides an
   educational bridge to recognizing the importance of detail in the
   clinical realm. In weighing multiple perspectives, observation applied
   to practice helps learners understand the nuances of the role of
   witness, activating reflection consonant with the viewer's professional
   identity. The realization that seeing is highly filtered through the
   observer's values allows the act of observation to come under scrutiny,
   opening the observer's gaze to disturbance and challenging the values
   and precepts of the prevailing medical culture. Application of
   observational skills can, for example, help observers recognize and
   address noxious effects of the built environment. As learners describe
   what they see, they also develop the communication skills needed to
   articulate both problems and possible improvements within their
   expanding sphere of influence. The ability to craft this speech as
   public narrative can lead to interventions with positive impacts on
   physicians, their colleagues, and patients.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDThe objective of this study was to clarify the communication
   preferences of patients with advanced cancer regarding discussions about
   ending anticancer treatment and transitioning to palliative care and to
   explore the variables associated with those preferences.
   METHODSParticipants were 106 Japanese patients with cancer who had been
   informed at least 1 week earlier about the cessation of their anticancer
   treatment. They completed a survey measuring their preferences for
   communication about ending anticancer treatment and transitioning to
   palliative care as well as their demographic characteristics. Medical
   records were also examined to investigate medical characteristics.
   RESULTSResults of the descriptive analysis indicated that patients
   strongly preferred their physicians to listen to their distress and
   concerns (96\%), to assure them that their painful symptoms would be
   controlled (97.1\%), and to explain the status of their illness and the
   physical symptoms that would likely occur in the future (95.1\%).
   Multiple regression analyses identified the factors associated with
   these preferences: telling patients to prepare mentally and informing
   them of their expected life expectancy were associated with cancer site;
   sustaining hope was associated with cancer site and children; and
   empathic paternalism was associated with duration since cancer
   diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONSThe majority of patients preferred their physicians to be
   realistic about their likely future and wanted to be reassured that
   their painful symptoms would be controlled. For patients with cancer at
   certain sites, those with children, and those more recently diagnosed,
   physicians should communicate carefully and actively by providing
   information on life expectancy and mental preparation, sustaining hope,
   and behaving with empathic paternalism. Cancer 2015;121:4240-4249. (c)

Title = {{Thai nursing students' experiences when attending real life situations

Journal = {{NURSE EDUCATION TODAY}},

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: During the last few years, manikin simulations have been
   used for cardiac life support training procedures in medical and nursing
   education. However, some nursing students have experienced attending
   real events involving cardiac life support during their clinical
   practice.
   Objective: This study aims to describe the meaning of experience of Thai
   nursing students when attending real situations of cardiac life support.
   Methods: A hermeneutic phenomenological study was used. Third and fourth
   year bachelor of nursing students at a university in the southern region
   of Thailand who had the experience of attending real situation of
   cardiac life support were purposely selected as the informants. The data
   were generated from individual in-depth interviews with eighteen nursing
   students. Van Manen's approach was used to analyze the data.
   Trustworthiness was established using the criteria set out by Lincoln
   and Guba.
   Results: Essential themes situated in the context of the four
   existential grounds of body, time, space, and relation emerged. These
   were: being worried and fearful while desiring to participate in cardiac
   life support procedures; enhancing self value; knowing each moment is
   meaningful for one's life; having time to understand the reality of
   life; being in a small corner; appreciating such opportunities and the
   encouragement given by nurses and the healthcare team; and feeling
   empathy.
   Conclusions: Besides learning in classrooms and practicing in labs,
   experiencing real situations is beneficial for nursing students in
   learning cardiac life support. This study provides information that can
   be used for clinical teaching management in the topics relating to
   cardiac life support. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Relevance of the rationalist-intuitionist debate for ethics and

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite widespread pedagogical efforts to modify discrete behaviors in
   developing physicians, the professionalism movement has generally shied
   away from essential questions such as what virtues characterize the good
   physician, and how are those virtues formed? Although there is
   widespread adoption of medical ethics curricula, there is still no
   consensus about the primary goals of ethics education. Two prevailing
   perspectives dominate the literature, constituting what is sometimes
   referred to as the ``virtue/skill dichotomy{''}. The first perspective
   argues that teaching ethics is a means of providing physicians with a
   skill set for analyzing and resolving ethical dilemmas. The second
   perspective suggests that teaching ethics is a means of creating
   virtuous physicians. The authors argue that this debate about medical
   ethics education mirrors the Rationalist-Intuitionist debate in
   contemporary moral psychology. In the following essay, the authors
   sketch the relevance of the Rationalist-Intuitionist debate to medical
   ethics and professionalism. They then outline a moral intuitionist model
   of virtuous caring that derives from but also extends the ``social
   intuitionist model{''} of moral action and virtue. This moral
   intuitionist model suggests several practical implications specifically
   for medical character education but also for health science education in
   general. This approach proposes that character development is best
   accomplished by tuning-up (activating) moral intuitions, amplifying
   (intensifying) moral emotions related to intuitions, and strengthening
   (expanding) intuition-expressive, emotion-related moral virtues, more
   than by ``learning{''} explicit ethical rules or principles.}},

Abstract = {{Callous-unemotional (CU) traits correlate with the severity and
   prognosis of conduct disorder in youth. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT)
   has been linked to prosocial behaviors, including empathy and
   collaboration with others. This study discusses a possible role for OT
   in the biology of delinquent behavior. We hypothesized that in
   delinquent youth OT secretion will correlate with the severity of
   conduct problems and specifically with the level of CU traits. The study
   group included 67 male adolescents (mean age 16.2 years) undergoing
   residential treatment, previously assessed by an open clinical interview
   and history for the psychiatric diagnosis. Staff based Inventory of
   Callous-Unemotional traits for psychopathy and Strength and Difficulties
   Questionnaire were administered, and patients' medical and social
   personal files were systematically coded for previous history of
   antisocial acts using the Brown-Goodwin Questionnaire. Salivary OT was
   assayed by ELISA. Salivary OT levels were inversely correlated with
   conduct problems severity on Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (r
   = -0.27; p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01). Recorded history of
   antisocial acts did not correlate with current OT levels. Odds ratio
   (OR) for significant CU traits among subjects with conduct problems was
   increased in low-OT (OR = 14, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05)
   but not in high-OT subjects (OR = 6, p a parts per thousand yen 0.05).
   Children with conduct problems and low levels of salivary OT are at risk
   for significant CU traits. These results suggest a possible role for
   salivary OT as a biomarker for CU traits and conduct problems severity.}},

Title = {{Impact of Surgery on Relationship Quality in Patients With Ulcerative

Journal = {{DISEASES OF THE COLON \& RECTUM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although social support is important for quality of life in
   patients undergoing surgery for ulcerative colitis, the impact of
   surgery on patient relationships is not known.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined relationship parameters in patients with
   ulcerative colitis and their partners before and 6 months after surgery.
   DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort in which we performed an
   exploratory analysis.
   SETTINGS: Patients were enrolled from an academic medical center.
   PATIENTS: Surgical patients with ulcerative colitis and their partners
   were invited to participate.
   INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent proctocolectomy in 1, 2, or 3 stages.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured quality of life and sexual function
   in patients, as well as relationship quality, empathy, and sexual
   satisfaction in patients and partners before and 6 months after surgery
   using validated questionnaires.
   RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 74 participants, including 37
   patients (25 men and 12 women) and their opposite-sex partners. Quality
   of life improved significantly in male and female patients after
   surgery. Sexual function scores also improved after surgery in male and
   female patients; however, the changes reached statistical significance
   in male patients only. Sexual satisfaction scores improved significantly
   after surgery in female patients and their partners. There was little
   change in relationship quality or empathy after surgery, with the
   exception of slightly improved relationship quality reported by male
   partners. In general, patients and partners reported levels of
   relationship quality and empathy similar to normative populations.
   LIMITATIONS: This study included a small, highly selected sample.
   CONCLUSIONS: Male and female patients with ulcerative colitis have
   high-quality relationships that are not negatively affected by surgical
   treatment. Changes in sexual function do not necessarily coincide with
   changes in sexual satisfaction in this patient population. Future
   studies should evaluate the effect of high-quality relationships on
   surgical outcomes.}},

Title = {{Exploring autistic-like traits relating to empathic attitude and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1258-1266}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Pharmacists are expected to play a key role in modern cancer
   care. Research suggests that an empathic approach and attitude in
   medical staff improves the quality of patient care. An empathic attitude
   and psychological distress are thought to be associated with
   autistic-like traits, but little is known about such traits. Objective
   In this study, we aimed to clarify the associations among autistic-like
   traits, empathic attitude in a medical context, and psychological health
   in hospital pharmacists. Setting Eligibility criteria for inclusion were
   certified pharmacists working at hospitals for patient care who returned
   their questionnaires. Method Eight hundred and twenty-three hospital
   pharmacists completed a number of self-administered questionnaires
   anonymously by mail. Main outcome measures Scores were obtained on the
   Autism-Spectrum Quotient, the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, the General
   Health Questionnaire-12, and subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index (Perspective Taking, IRI-Empathic Concern, IRIPersonal Distress).
   We performed correlation and mediation analyses to confirm that the
   empathy and general health questionnaires were associated with
   autism-spectrum quotient scores, and with each IRI subscale. Results
   Complete responses were obtained from 379 pharmacists comprising 151
   males (39.8 \%) with a mean age of 37.7 +/- A 10.8 years (missing data,
   n = 13) and a median of 11 years after qualification as a pharmacist.
   Autism-Spectrum Quotient scores were inversely correlated with empathy
   (r = -0.22, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with general health
   scores (r = 0.40, p < 0.001). In the models with mediation, the inverse
   correlation between autism-spectrum quotient and empathy scores was
   mediated indirectly by IRI-Perspective Taking and IRI-Empathic Concern,
   and the positive correlation between autism-spectrum quotient and
   general health was mediated indirectly by IRI-Personal Distress. There
   were also direct effects, with significant effects of autism-spectrum
   quotient on empathy and general health scores. Conclusion Our findings
   suggest that autistic-like traits affect both empathic attitude in a
   medical context and the psychological health of pharmacists. We
   recommend that to improve empathy in those with high levels of
   autistic-like traits, we may need to develop specialized interventions,
   such as improving communication skills training.}},

   perspective-taking, and standing in the patient's shoes. Confirmatory
   factor analysis on the second half of the sample showed good fit indexes
   for the 14-item solution, indicated by the exploratory factor analysis,
   and the 20 item solution of the scale, with the exception of one item.
   Test-retest correlation was 0.50 (P<0.001) for the overall scale.
   Results from group comparisons and correlations are also provided and

Abstract = {{People mimic verbal and nonverbal expressions and behaviour of their
   counterparts in various social interactions. Research in psychology and
   social sciences has shown that mimicry has the power to influence social
   judgment and various social behaviours, including negotiation and
   debating, courtship, empathy and helping behaviour. Hence, automatic
   recognition of mimicry behaviour would be a valuable tool in various
   domains, and especially in negotiation skills enhancement and medical
   help provision training. In this work, we present the MAHNOB mimicry
   database, a set of fully synchronised, multi-sensory, audiovisual
   recordings of naturalistic dyadic interactions, suitable for
   investigation of mimicry and negotiation behaviour. The database
   contains 11 h of recordings, split over 54 sessions of dyadic
   interactions between 12 confederates and their 48 counterparts, being
   engaged either in a socio-political discussion or negotiating a tenancy
   agreement. To provide a benchmark for efforts in machine understanding
   of mimicry behaviour, we report a number of baseline experiments based
   on visual data only. Specifically, we consider face and head movements,
   and report on binary classification of video sequences into mimicry and
   non-mimicry categories based on the following widely-used methodologies:
   two similarity-based methods (cross correlation and time warping), and a
   state-of-the-art temporal classifier (Long Short Term Memory Recurrent
   Neural Network). The best reported results are session-dependent, and
   affected by the sparsity of positive examples in the data. This suggests
   that there is much room for improvement upon the reported baseline
   experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Humanism is a complex construct that defies simplistic measurement. How
   educators measure humanism shapes understanding and implications for
   learners. This systematic review sought to address the following
   questions: How do medical educators assess humanism in medical students,
   and how does the measurement impact the understanding of humanism in
   undergraduate medical education (UME)?
   Method
   Using the IECARES (integrity, excellence, compassion, altruism, respect,
   empathy, and service) Gold Foundation framework, a search of English
   literature databases from 2000 to 2013 on assessment of humanism in
   medical students revealed more than 900 articles, of which 155 met
   criteria for analysis. Using descriptive statistics, articles and
   assessments were analyzed for construct measured, study design,
   assessment method, instrument type, perspective/source of assessment,
   student level, validity evidence, and national context.
   Results
   Of 202 assessments reported in 155 articles, 162 (80\%) used surveys;
   164 (81\%) used student self-reports. One hundred nine articles (70\%)
   included only one humanism construct. Empathy was the most prevalent
   construct present in 96 (62\%); 49 (51\%) of those used a single
   instrument. One hundred fifteen (74\%) used exclusively quantitative
   data; only 48 (31\%) used a longitudinal design. Construct
   underrepresentation was identified as a threat to validity in half of
   the assessments. Articles included 34 countries; 87 (56\%) were from
   North America.
   Conclusions
   Assessment of humanism in UME incorporates a limited scope of a complex
   construct, often relying on single quantitative measures from
   self-reported survey instruments. This highlights the need for multiple
   methods, perspectives, and longitudinal designs to strengthen the
   validity of humanism assessments.}},

Title = {{Seeing Things Differently or Seeing Different Things? Exploring Raters'
   Associations of Noncognitive Attributes}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{11, S}},
Pages = {{S50-S55}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Raters represent a significant source of unexplained, and often
   undesired, variance in performance-based assessments. To better
   understand rater variance, this study investigated how various raters,
   observing the same performance, perceived relationships amongst
   different noncognitive attributes measured in performance assessments.
   Method
   Medical admissions data from a Multiple Mini-Interview (MMI) used at one
   Canadian medical school were collected and subsequently analyzed using
   the Many Facet Rasch Model (MFRM) and hierarchical clustering. This
   particular MMI consisted of eight stations. At each station a faculty
   member and an upper-year medical student rated applicants on various
   noncognitive attributes including communication, critical thinking,
   effectiveness, empathy, integrity, maturity, professionalism, and
   resolution.
   Results
   The Rasch analyses revealed differences between faculty and student
   raters across the eight different MMI stations. These analyses also
   identified that, at times, raters were unable to distinguish between the
   various noncognitive attributes. Hierarchical clustering highlighted
   differences in how faculty and student raters observed the various
   noncognitive attributes. Differences in how individual raters associated
   the various attributes within a station were also observed.
   Conclusions
   The MFRM and hierarchical clustering helped to explain some of the
   variability associated with raters in a way that other measurement
   models are unable to capture. These findings highlight that differences
   in ratings may result from raters possessing different interpretations
   of an observed performance. This study has implications for developing
   more purposeful rater selection and rater profiling in performance-based
   assessments.}},

   information concerning the illness and its prognosis do they want to
   know, which symptoms are expected and how will they affect the quantity
   and quality of life? All these aspects have to be answered by the
   medical team as well as by the patients themselves.
   The most important requirements for approaching patients with
   life-threatening diseases are empathy on the one hand and objectivity
   and professional distance on the other in order to be able to assess the
   individual perspectives of patients. As only a few medical care
   professionals have personal experience with terminal illnesses
   themselves, unique difficulties arise. In other medical care situations,
   professionals can fall back on personal experiences and can transfer
   these to specific situations but when faced with a terminal illness they
   can only act on experiences indirectly gained by caring for other
   terminally ill patients.
   Patients with terminal illnesses have an especially high need for
   respect, autonomy, individuality and the preservation of dignity but
   patients experience a situation which is determined by challenging
   aspects, such as symptom burden, intimate dependency, hopelessness,
   fears and despair and decreasing quality of life. With every new
   patient, medical care professionals have to create an atmosphere of
   respect and reliability in which patients can find an individual balance
   between wishes for autonomy and the need of medical and social care.}},

Title = {{Measuring empathic, person-centred communication in primary care nurses:
   validity and reliability of the Consultation and Relational Empathy
   (CARE) Measure}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathic patient-centred care is central to high quality
   health encounters. The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
   Measure is a patient-rated experience measure of the interpersonal
   quality of healthcare encounters. The measure has been extensively
   validated and is widely used by doctors in primary care but has not been
   validated in nursing. This study assessed the validity and reliability
   of the CARE Measure in routine nurse consultations in primary care.
   Methods: Seventeen nurses from nine general medical practices located in
   three Scottish Health Boards participated in the study. Consecutive
   patients (aged 16 years or older) were asked to self-complete a
   questionnaire containing the CARE Measure immediately after their
   clinical encounter with the nurse. Statistical analysis included
   Spearman's correlation and principal component analysis (construct
   validity), Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency), and Generalisability
   theory (inter-rater reliability).
   Results: A total of 774 patients (327 male and 447 female) completed the
   questionnaire. Almost three out of four patients (73 \%) felt that the
   CARE Measure items were very important to their current consultation.
   The number of `not applicable' responses and missing values were low
   overall (5.7 and 1.6 \% respectively). The mean CARE Measure score in
   the consultations was 45.9 and 48 \% achieved the maximum possible score
   of 50. CARE Measure scores correlated in predicted ways with overall
   satisfaction and patient enablement in support of convergent and
   divergent validity. Factor analysis found that the CARE Measure items
   loaded highly onto a single factor. The measure showed high internal
   consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.97) and acceptable
   inter-rater reliability (G = 0.6 with 60 patients ratings per nurse).
   The scores were not affected by patients' age, gender, self-perceived
   overall health, living arrangements, employment status or language
   spoken at home.
   Conclusions: The CARE Measure has high face and construct validity, and
   internal reliability in nurse consultations in primary care. Its ability
   to discriminate between nurses is sufficient for educational and quality
   improvement purposes.}},

Title = {{Sex and STEM Occupation Predict Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) Scores in
   Half a Million People}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{This study assesses Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores in a `big data'
   sample collected through the UK Channel 4 television website, following
   the broadcasting of a medical education program. We examine correlations
   between the AQ and age, sex, occupation, and UK geographic region in
   450,394 individuals. We predicted that age and geography would not be
   correlated with AQ, whilst sex and occupation would have a correlation.
   Mean AQ for the total sample score was m = 19.83 (SD = 8.71), slightly
   higher than a previous systematic review of 6,900 individuals in a
   non-clinical sample (mean of means = 16.94) This likely reflects that
   this big-data sample includes individuals with autism who in the
   systematic review score much higher (mean of means = 35.19). As
   predicted, sex and occupation differences were observed: on average,
   males (m = 21.55, SD = 8.82) scored higher than females (m = 18.95; SD =
   8.52), and individuals working in a STEM career (m = 21.92, SD = 8.92)
   scored higher than individuals non-STEM careers (m = 18.92, SD = 8.48).
   Also as predicted, age and geographic region were not meaningfully
   correlated with AQ. These results support previous findings relating to
   sex and STEM careers in the largest set of individuals for which AQ
   scores have been reported and suggest the AQ is a useful self-report
   measure of autistic traits.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether a novel structured curriculum could
   significantly improve medical student performance in early pregnancy
   loss counseling.
   BACKGROUND: Medical students receive limited exposure to early pregnancy
   loss counseling through real-life observation of this important skill.
   METHODS: A pre-post control group design was used to examine early
   pregnancy loss counseling performance among medical students from two
   medical schools doing their obstetrics and gynecology rotations at the
   same community hospital. The study outcomes were: (1) pre-post
   differences in Standardized Patient Objective Structured Clinical
   Examination scores; (2) pre-post differences in student confidence
   levels; and (3) post-differences in standardized patient empathy
   ratings. Both groups had similar demographics, academic parameters, and
   longitudinal curricula. The study group (N=39) received a curriculum of
   demonstration and role-playing for delivering bad news and a shared
   decision-making model for early pregnancy loss management. The control
   group (N=38) received traditional instruction.
   RESULTS: Standardized Patient Objective Structured Clinical Examination
   posttest scores were significantly higher for the study group compared
   with the control group (94.2\% compared with 69.7\%, P<.001) after
   starting with similar pretest scores (64.0\% compared with 61.6\%,
   P=.53). Posttest confidence levels (1=high, 5=low) were significantly
   higher for the study compared with the control group (1.57 compared with
   3.62, P<.001) after starting at similar levels (4.27 compared with 4.23,
   P=.79). Standardized patient empathy ratings (1=high, 5=low) were
   significantly higher for the study compared with the control group (1.84
   compared with 2.62, P=.002).
   CONCLUSION: A structured curriculum for teaching early pregnancy loss
   counseling improved student performance on standardized Objective
   Structured Clinical Examinations compared with traditional instruction.
   Providing these counseling tools improved their confidence and empathy
   ratings in caring for patients with early pregnancy loss.}},

Title = {{What do people appreciate in physicians' communication? An international

Journal = {{HEALTH EXPECTATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1215-1226}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background The literature shows that the quality of communication is
   usually determined from a professional perspective. Patients or lay
   people are seldom involved in the development of quality indicators or
   communication.
   Objective To give voice to the lay people perspective on what
   constitutes `good communication' by evoking their reactions to
   variations in physician communication.
   Design Lay people from four different countries watched the same
   videotaped standardized medical encounters and discussed their
   preferences in gender-specific focus groups who were balanced in age
   groups.
   Setting and participants Two hundred and fifty-nine lay people (64 NL,
   72 IT, 75 UK and 48 BE) distributed over 35 focus groups of 6-8 persons
   each.
   Main variables studied Comments on doctors' behaviours were classified
   by the GULiVer framework in terms of contents and preferences.
   Results Participants prevalently discussed `task-oriented expressions'
   (39\%: competency, self-confident, providing solutions), `affective
   oriented/emotional expressions' (25\%: empathy, listening, reassuring)
   and `process-oriented expressions' (23\%: flexibility, summarizing,
   verifying). `Showing an affective attitude' was most appreciated
   (positive percentage within category: 93\%, particularly facilitations
   and inviting attitude), followed by `providing solution' (85\%). Among
   disfavoured behaviour, repetitions (88\%), `writing and reading' (54\%)
   and asking permission (42\%) were found.
   Conclusions Although an affective attitude is appreciated by nearly
   everybody, people may vary widely in their communication needs and
   preferences: what is `good communication' for one person may be disliked
   or even a source of irritation for another. A physician should be
   flexible and capable of adapting the consultation to the different needs
   of different patients. This challenges the idea of general communication
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the role of microaggressions in the interactions

   constitutive property of medical interactions and their contribution to
   a class-differentiated and discriminatory local social world. Based on
   ethnographic fieldwork over the course of three months (2008-2011) the
   study examined the clinical relationships between obstetric patients and
   clinicians in a public hospital in the city of Puebla, Mexico. It
   reveals four factors present in the social hierarchies in Mexico that
   predispose clinicians to callous interactions toward ``problematic
   others{''} in society, resulting in microaggressions within clinical
   encounters: (a) perceptions of suitability for good motherhood; (b)
   moralized versions of modern motherhood inscribed on patient bodies; (c)
   a priori assumptions about the hypersexuality of low-income women; and
   (d) clinician frustration exacerbated by overwork resulting in corporeal
   violence. This work concludes by questioning the efforts for universal
   health rights that do not address underlying social and economic

Abstract = {{Although the importance of empathy, rapport, and anxiety/pain awareness
   in dentist-patient relations has been well documented, these factors
   continue to be an issue with patients in many dental school clinics. The
   aim of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of how
   patients at an urban, university-affiliated medical center and its
   dental school's clinic experienced oral health care and to generate
   ideas for improving the dental school's clinical curriculum and
   management of the clinic. Although patient satisfaction surveys are
   common, in-depth patient narratives are an underutilized resource for
   improving dental education. In-depth qualitative interviews were
   conducted with 20 uninsured or underinsured dental patients at these
   sites, and the results were analyzed using content analysis. Major
   phenomena that participants discussed were the importance of empathy and
   good rapport with their oral health providers and provider awareness of
   dental pain and anxiety. Many patients also discussed feeling
   dehumanized during dental visits. Based on their positive and negative
   experiences, the participants made suggestions for how oral health

Title = {{Health Care Professionals' Responses to Religious or Spiritual
   Statements by Surrogate Decision Makers During Goals-of-Care Discussions}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Although many patients and their families view religion or
   spirituality as an important consideration near the end of life, little
   is known about the extent to which religious or spiritual considerations
   arise during goals-of-care conversations in the intensive care unit.
   OBJECTIVES To determine how frequently surrogate decision makers and
   health care professionals discuss religious or spiritual considerations
   during family meetings in the intensive care unit and to characterize
   how health care professionals respond to such statements by surrogates.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter prospective cohort study
   was conducted between October 8, 2009, and October 24, 2012, regarding
   249 goals-of-care conversations between 651 surrogate decision makers
   and 441 health care professionals in 13 intensive care units across the
   United States. Audio-recorded conversations between surrogate decision
   makers and health care professionals were analyzed, transcribed, and
   qualitatively coded. Data analysis took place from March 10, 2012,
   through May 24, 2014.
   EXPOSURES Goals-of-care conferences.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Constant comparative methods to develop a
   framework for coding religious and spiritual statements were applied to
   the transcripts. Participants completed demographic questionnaires that
   included religious affiliation and religiosity.
   RESULTS Of 457 surrogate decision makers, 355 (77.6\%) endorsed religion
   or spirituality as fairly or very important in their life. Discussion of
   religious or spiritual considerations occurred in 40 of 249 conferences
   (16.1\%). Surrogates were the first to raise religious or spiritual
   considerations in most cases (26 of 40). Surrogates' statements (n = 59)
   fell into the following 5 main categories: references to their religious
   or spiritual beliefs, including miracles (n = 34); religious practices
   (n = 19); religious community (n = 8); the notion that the physician is
   God's instrument to promote healing (n = 4); and the interpretation that
   the end of life is a new beginning for their loved one (n = 4). Some
   statements fell into more than 1 category. In response to surrogates'
   religious or spiritual statements, health care professionals redirected
   the conversation to medical considerations (n = 15), offered to involve
   hospital spiritual care providers or the patient's own religious or
   spiritual community (n = 14), expressed empathy (n = 13), acknowledged
   surrogates' statements (n = 11), or explained their own religious or
   spiritual beliefs (n = 3). In only 8 conferences did health care
   professionals attempt to further understand surrogates' beliefs, for
   example, by asking questions about the patient's religion.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among a cohort of surrogate decision makers
   with a relatively high degree of religiosity, discussion of religious or
   spiritual considerations occurred in fewer than 20\% of goals-of-care
   conferences in intensive care units, and health care professionals
   rarely explored the patient's or family's religious or spiritual ideas.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To assess whether any differences exist in Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index (IRI) scores among postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1)
   residents across specialties.
   Methods PGY-1 residents representing 11 specialties at our academic
   institution were invited to take a Web-based IRI survey at three time
   points. The specialties were condensed into several binary groups for
   analysis: internal medicine (IM) versus non-IM; primary care (IM, family
   medicine) versus nonprimary care; emergency medicine (EM, including the
   combined IM/EM) versus non-EM; surgical specialties (general surgery,
   obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, urology) versus
   nonsurgical specialties (EM, family medicine, IM, neurology, pathology,
   and psychiatry); men versus women; and age groups. A repeated-measures
   generalized-estimating equations approach was taken to analyze the
   effect of specialty and time on each of the four IRI subscales.
   Results Of 94 PGY-1 residents invited to participate at each time point,
   74 (77.1\%) completed the survey at least once. Response rates at each
   time point were similar (mean 47.9\%). When comparing the IM (n = 35)
   and non-IM (n = 39) groups, the perspective-taking subscale was found to
   be significantly lower in the non-IM group (P = 0.006). Among male (n =
   46) versus female residents (n = 26), the personal-distress subscale was
   significantly different overall (P = 0.041) but not among time points.
   No other significant differences were found between groups. The
   conglomerate subscale scores throughout the year did not show a dramatic
   change.
   Conclusions Our study of IRI subscales in PGY-1 residents showed no
   major difference among specialties across 1 year except for IM
   residents, who scored significantly higher (more favorably) in the
   perspective-taking subscale. Contrary to previous studies, we did not
   observe a substantial decline in the empathic concern subscale IM
   residents over their first year.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Clinical empathy is considered to be one of the most
   important skills for medical. professionals. It is primarily conveyed by
   nonverbal behavior; however, little is known about the importance of
   different types of cues and their relation to engagement and sincerity
   as possible correlates of perceived clinical empathy (PCE). In this
   study, we explored the effect of doctor's gaze and body orientation on
   PCE with the help of 32 video vignettes.
   Methods: Actors impersonating medical interns displayed different
   combinations of gaze and body orientation while uttering an empathetic
   verbal statement. The video vignettes were evaluated in terms of the
   perceived clinical and general empathy, engagement and sincerity.
   Results: A principal component analysis revealed a possible
   single-factor solution for the scales measuring the two types of
   empathy, engagement and sincerity; therefore, they were subsumed under
   general perceived empathy (GPE). An analysis of variance showed a main
   effect of gaze and body orientation, with a stronger effect of gaze, on
   GPE. We subsequently performed a linear random effects analysis, which
   indicated possible gender-related differences in the perception of gaze.
   Conclusions: The outcomes of our experiment confirm that both gaze and
   body orientation have an influence on the GPE. The effect of gaze,
   however, appears to be gender-dependent: in the experiment, males were
   perceived as slightly more empathetic with patient-centered gaze, while
   for females averted gaze resulted in higher GnE scores.
   Practice implications: The findings are directly relevant in the context
   of medical communication training. Perception of clinical empathy
   supports medical information transfer, diagnosis quality and other
   patient outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Patient-Provider Interactions Affect Symptoms in Gastroesophageal Reflux
   Disease: A Pilot Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Background
   It is unclear whether the benefits that some patients derive from
   complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) are related to the
   therapies recommended or to the consultation process as some CIM
   provider visits are more involved than conventional medical visits. Many
   patients with gastrointestinal conditions seek out CIM therapies, and
   prior work has demonstrated that the quality of the patient-provider
   interaction can improve health outcomes in irritable bowel syndrome,
   however, the impact of this interaction on gastroesophageal reflux
   disease (GERD) is unknown. We aimed to assess the safety and feasibility
   of conducting a 2x2 factorial design study preliminarily exploring the
   impact of the patient-provider interaction, and the effect of an
   over-the-counter homeopathic product, Acidil, on symptoms and
   health-related quality of life in subjects with GERD.
   Methods
   24 subjects with GERD-related symptoms were randomized in a 2x2
   factorial design to receive 1) either a standard visit based on an
   empathic conventional primary care evaluation or an expanded visit with
   questions modeled after a CIM consultation and 2) either Acidil or
   placebo for two weeks. Subjects completed a daily GERD symptom diary and
   additional measures of symptom severity and health-related quality of
   life.
   Results
   There was no significant difference in GERD symptom severity between the
   Acidil and placebo groups from baseline to follow-up (p = 0.41),
   however, subjects who received the expanded visit were significantly
   more likely to report a 50\% or greater improvement in symptom severity
   compared to subjects who received the standard visit (p = 0.01). Total
   consultation length, perceived empathy, and baseline beliefs in CIM were
   not associated with treatment outcomes.
   Conclusion
   An expanded patient-provider visit resulted in greater GERD symptom
   improvement than a standard empathic medical visit. CIM consultations
   may have enhanced placebo effects, and further studies to assess the
   active components of this visit-based intervention are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Clinical works at the intersection of `spirituality, religion, theology
   and medicine' are studied to identify various aspects of what
   constitutes spirituality, what contributes to spiritual health and how
   to provide spiritual-healers for our current health-care system.
   Recent findings
   Spiritual care in the current medical world can be classed grossly into
   two departments: complementary and alternative medicine, considered as
   proxy variable for spirituality, and physician-initiated clinical
   Chaplaincy, informed by theology. The large body of research on `self'
   as a therapeutic tool, though, falls into subtle categories:
   phenomenological studies, empathy, embodied care, and mindfulness-based
   therapies. Development in the field of `spiritual medicine' has focused
   on spirituality-related curricula.
   Summary
   As mindfulness-based meditation programs help build deep listening
   skills needed to stay aware of the `self', Clinical Pastoral Education
   trains the chaplain to transcend the `self' to provide embodied care.
   Clinical chaplaincy is the destination for health-care professionals as
   well as theological/religious scholars who have patients' spiritual
   health as their primary focus. Medical education curricula that train
   students in chaplain's model of transpersonal-mindfulness/empathy
   founded on neuro-physiological principles would help them gain skills in
   embodied care. Such education would seamlessly integrate evidence-based
   clinical practice and spiritual-theological concepts.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeThe validity of medical student projection of, and predictors
   for, rural practice and the association of a measure of service
   orientation, projected practice accessibility to the indigent, were
   investigated.
   MethodsWest Virginia (WV) medical student online pre- and postrural
   rotation questionnaire data were collected during the time period
   2001-2009. Of the 1,517 respondent students, submissions by 1,271 met
   the time interval criterion for inclusion in analyses. Subsequent WV
   licensing data were available for 461 in 2013. These 2 databases were
   used to assess for validity of projection of rural practice, for
   predictors of rural practice, and for student projected accessibility of
   the future practice to indigent patients.
   FindingsThere were statistically significant associations between both
   pre- and postrotation projections of rural practice and subsequent rural
   practice. The most significant independent predictors of rural practice
   were student rural background, reported primary care intent, prediction
   of rural practice and projection of greater accessibility of the future
   practice to indigent patients. For scoring of practice access, there
   were trends for higher scoring by rural students and rural
   practitioners, with greater pre-post increases for those with urban
   hometowns.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the utility of medical student
   questionnaires for projections of numbers of future rural physicians. It
   suggests that students with a rural background, rural practice intent,
   or greater service orientation are more likely to enter rural practice.
   It also suggests that students, particularly those with urban hometowns,
   are influenced by rural rotation experiences in forecasting greater
   practice accessibility and in entering rural practice.}},

Abstract = {{Caring for critically ill and dying patients often triggers both
   professional and personal growth for physician trainees. In pediatrics,
   the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is among the most distressing
   settings for trainees. We used longitudinal narrative writing to gain
   insight into how physician trainees are challenged by and make sense of
   repetitive, ongoing conflicts experienced as part of caring for very
   sick and dying babies. The study took place in a 45-bed,
   university-based NICU in an urban setting in the United States. From
   November 2009 to June 2010 we enrolled pediatric residents and
   neonatology fellows at the beginning of their NICU rotations.
   Participants were asked to engage in individual, longitudinal narrative
   writing about their ``experience in the NICU.{''} Thematic narrative
   analysis was performed. Thirty-seven physician trainees participated in
   the study. The mean number of narratives per trainee was 12; a total of
   441 narratives were available for analysis. Conflict was the most
   pervasive theme in the narratives. Trainees experienced conflicts with
   families and conflicts with other clinicians. Trainees also described
   multiple conflicts of identity as members of the neonatology team, as
   members of the medical profession, as members of their own families, and
   as members of society. Physician trainees experience significant
   conflict and distress while learning to care for critically ill and
   dying infants. These conflicts often led them to question their own
   morals and their role in the medical profession. Physician trainees
   should be educated to expect various types of distress during intensive
   care rotations, encouraged to identify their own sources of distress,
   and supported in mitigating their effects.}},

Abstract = {{Shared presence is a state of being in which physicians and patients
   enter into a deep sense of trust, respect, and knowing that facilitates
   healing. Communication between physicians and patients (and, in fact,
   all providers and recipients of health care) is the medium through which
   shared presence occurs, regardless of the presenting problem, time
   available, location of care, or clinical history of the patient.
   Conceptualizing how communication leads to shared presence has been a
   challenging task, however. Pathways of this process have been routinely
   lumped together as the biopsychosocial model or patient, person, and
   relationship-centered care-all deceptive in their simplicity but, in
   fact, highly complex-or reduced to descriptive explications of one
   constituent element (e.g., empathy). In this article, we reconcile these
   pathways and elements by presenting a graphic image for clinicians and
   teachers in medical education. This conceptual image serves as a
   framework to synthesize the vast literature on physician-patient
   communication. We place shared presence, the fundamental characteristic
   of effective clinical communication, at the center of our figure. Around
   this focal point, we locate four elemental factors that either
   contribute to or result from shared presence, including interpersonal
   skills, relational contexts, actions in clinical encounters, and healing
   outcomes. By visually presenting various known and emergent theories of
   physician-patient communication, outlining the flow of successful
   encounters between physicians and patients, and noting how such
   encounters can improve outcomes, physicians, other health care
   professionals, and medical educators can better grasp the complexity,
   richness, and potential for achieving shared presence with their
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the basic principles, fundamentals and initial
   steps in building relationships with adolescents with psychological and
   psychosomatic problems from the perspective of an institution
   specialized in psychosomatic diseases. Adolescents consulting this
   institution often suffer from somatoform disorders, anxiety,
   deterioration of physical and mental fitness, appetite and sleeping
   disorders, symptoms of eating disorders including loss of body weight
   and sometimes attend involuntarily due to a refusal to undertake school
   or occupational duties. The importance of the combined effects of risk
   and protective factors can be rapidly recognized in routine daily
   practice. In most cases several coactive risk factors are confronted by
   only few or even no protective factors or owing to circumstances
   existing resilience factors could not be activated. The fundamental
   prerequisites for initiating communication with this group of
   adolescents include a suitable ambience, attentive manner, warmth,
   empathy, enough time to be able to establish trust and a professional
   manner with a sensitive tenor. The communicative competence for
   conducting specialized medical consultations with adolescents and their
   parents necessitates the acquisition of principle communication skills
   and advanced skills using professional training and to implement these
   skills into the practice accompanied by professional reflection (Balint
   groups, supervision).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore whether and how patient multimorbidity and
   socioeconomic deprivation might influence patients' emotional expression
   and doctors' responses in the general practice (GP) consultations.
   Methods: Video recordings of 107 consultations (eight GPs) were coded
   with the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES).
   Multilevel logistic regressions modelled the probability of GP providing
   space response, considering patient multimorbidity, deprivation
   conditions and other contextual factors. Further multinomial regressions
   explored the possible impact of multimorbidity and deprivation on
   expression of and specific responses to patients' emotional distress.
   Results: It was less likely for GPs to provide space as the consultation
   proceeded, controlling for multimorbidity and deprivation variables.
   Patients with multimorbidity were less likely to express emotional
   distress in an explicit form. GPs were more likely to provide
   acknowledgement to emotions expressed by patients from more deprived
   areas.
   Conclusion: Multimorbidity and deprivation may influence the dynamics of
   the GP consultations in specific ways. Rigorous methodologies using
   larger samples are required to explore further how these two variables
   relate to each other and influence cue expression, provider response and
   subsequent patient outcomes.
   Practice implications: Understanding how multimorbidity and deprivation
   impact on GP consultations may help inform future service improvement

Title = {{Considerations in the use of reflective writing for student assessment:
   issues of reliability and validity}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{ContextReflective writing is a popular tool to support the growth of
   reflective capacity in undergraduate medical learners. Its popularity
   stems from research suggesting that reflective capacity may lead to
   improvements in skills such as empathy, communication, collaboration and
   professionalism. This has led to assumptions that reflective writing can
   also serve as a tool for student assessment. However, evidence to
   support the reliability and validity of reflective writing asa
   meaningful assessment strategy is lacking.
   MethodsUsing a published instrument for measuring reflective capacity'
   (the Reflection Evaluation for Learners' Enhanced Competencies Tool
   {[}REFLECT]), four trained raters independently scored four samples of
   writing from each of 107 undergraduate medical students to determine the
   reliability of reflective writing scores. REFLECT scores were then
   correlated with scores on a Year4 objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) and Year2 multiple-choice question (MCQ) examinations
   to examine, respectively, convergent and divergent validity.
   ResultsAcross four writing samples, four-rater Cronbach's -values ranged
   from 0.72 to 0.82, demonstrating reasonable inter-rater reliability with
   four raters using the REFLECT rubric. However, inter-sample reliability
   was fairly low (four-sample Cronbach's =0.54, single-sample intraclass
   correlation coefficient: 0.23), which suggests that performance on one
   reflective writing sample was not strongly indicative of performance on
   the next. Approximately 14 writing samples are required to achieve
   reasonable inter-sample reliability. The study found weak,
   non-significant correlations between reflective writing scores and both
   OSCE global scores (r=0.13) and MCQ examination scores (r=0.10),
   demonstrating a lack of relationship between reflective writing and
   these measures of performance.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that to draw meaningful conclusions
   about reflective capacity as a stable construct in individuals requires
   14 writing samples per student, each assessed by four or five raters.
   This calls into question the feasibility and utility of using reflective
   writing rigorously as an assessment tool in undergraduate medical
   education.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis do not receive
   guideline-concordant liver care. Cirrhosis patients are less likely to
   receive recommended care when followed exclusively by primary care
   providers (PCPs), as opposed to specialty co-management. Little is known
   about how to optimize cirrhosis care delivered by PCPs.
   We conducted a qualitative analysis to explore PCPs' attitudes and
   self-reported roles in caring for patients with cirrhosis.
   We recruited PCPs from seven Veterans Affairs facilities in the Pacific
   Northwest via in-service trainings and direct email from March to
   October 2012 (n = 24). Trained staff administered structured telephone
   interviews covering: (1) general attitudes; (2) roles and practices; and
   (3) barriers and facilitators to cirrhosis management. Two trained,
   independent coders reviewed each interview transcript and thematically
   coded responses.
   Three overarching themes emerged in PCPs' perceptions of cirrhosis
   patients: the often overwhelming complexity of comorbid medical,
   psychiatric, and substance issues; the importance of patient
   self-management; and challenges surrounding specialty care involvement
   and co-management of cirrhosis. While PCPs felt they brought important
   skills to bear, such as empathy and care coordination, they strongly
   preferred to defer major cirrhosis management decisions to specialists.
   The most commonly reported barriers to care included patient behaviors,
   access issues, and conflicts with specialists.
   PCPs perceive Veterans with cirrhosis as having significant medical and
   psychosocial challenges. PCPs tend not to see their role as directing
   cirrhosis-related management decisions. Educational efforts directed at
   PCPs must foster PCP empowerment and improve comfort with managing
   cirrhosis.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundClinicians involved in medical errors can experience
   significant distress. This study aims to examine (1) how medical errors
   impact anaesthesiologists in key work and life domains; (2)
   anaesthesiologists' attitudes regarding support after errors; (3) and
   which anaesthesiologists are most affected by errors.
   MethodsThis study is a mailed cross-sectional survey completed by 281 of
   the 542 clinically active anaesthesiologists (52\% response rate)
   working at Switzerland's five university hospitals between July 2012 and
   April 2013.
   ResultsRespondents reported that errors had negatively affected anxiety
   about future errors (51\%), confidence in their ability as a doctor
   (45\%), ability to sleep (36\%), job satisfaction (32\%), and
   professional reputation (9\%). Respondents' lives were more likely to be
   affected as error severity increased. Ninety percent of respondents
   disagreed that hospitals adequately support them in coping with the
   stress associated with medical errors. Nearly all of the respondents
   (92\%) reported being interested in psychological counselling after a
   serious error, but many identified barriers to seeking counselling.
   However, there were significant differences between departments
   regarding error-related stress levels and attitudes about error-related
   support. Respondents were more likely to experience certain distress if
   they were female, older, had previously been involved in a serious
   error, and were dissatisfied with their last error disclosure.
   ConclusionMedical errors, even minor errors and near misses, can have a
   serious effect on clinicians. Health-care organisations need to do more
   to support clinicians in coping with the stress associated with medical
   errors.}},

Title = {{Depression and stress amongst undergraduate medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: The demands placed on medical trainees pose a challenge to
   personal wellbeing, leading to burnout and erosion of empathy. However,
   it is unclear at what point in medical education this decline begins.
   Although many schools have begun to design and implement wellness
   programs for their students, the medical education community's
   experience in evaluating their impact is limited.
   Methods: The authors designed a wellness needs assessment of all medical
   students at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in order to assess
   students' health behaviors, stress and depressive symptoms. The online
   survey was administered to all medical students from the classes of 2014
   and 2015 at the beginning of their first year of medical school and
   again at the end of their third year. Chi-square and T-tests were run
   comparing the survey responses of the two classes.
   Results: There was a significant increase in perceived stress from an
   average of 5.51 in the first year to 6.49 in the third year (p = .0001).
   The number of students at risk for depression, defined as a CES-D score
   greater than 16, was 94 (28.4 \%) in the first year and 131 (39.0 \%) in
   their third year (p =.004).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significant increase in the
   proportion of students at risk for depression in their third year as
   compared to the first year as well as an increase in perceived stress.
   In response to these findings, the authors took a multi-disciplinary
   approach in the development of a comprehensive program to address
   student wellness, including efforts to address issues specific to the
   clinical clerkships. This program is unique in that its design,
   inception and ongoing evaluation have taken the needs of an entire
   medical school class into account.}},

Title = {{Two new scales for integrative medical education and research:

   symptoms}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Training in integrative medicine aims to promote
   compassionate, patient-centered care, including non-pharmaceutical
   therapies to reduce common symptoms. Although specific competencies have
   been identified, few tools are available to assess clinician confidence
   in providing integrative care. We evaluated two instruments to address
   this gap.
   Methods: We assessed face validity with focus groups. We assessed
   internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha) and convergent validity in a
   survey of 213 health professionals, correlating the new instruments to
   each other and to standard measures of mindfulness, compassion, empathy,
   training, and practice.
   Results: The two measures each had 10 items with scores ranging from 0
   to 100, and had good face validity. Cronbach's alpha was 0.87 for the
   calm, compassionate care scale (CCCS) and 0.95 for self-efficacy in
   providing non-drug therapies to relieve common symptoms (SEND). Scores
   for CCCS were significantly correlated with measures of mindfulness,
   compassion, empathic concern, and perspective-taking as well as training
   and practice (p < 0.05 for each). Scores for SEND were similarly
   correlated with CCCS, compassion, empathic concern, and
   perspective-taking as well as training and practice (p < 0.05 for each).
   Conclusion: These two new tools, CCCS and SEND, have good psychometric
   properties and may be useful to educators and researchers evaluating
   clinicians' confidence in providing calm, compassionate care and
   self-efficacy in using non-drug therapies to relieve common symptoms.

Title = {{Clinical realism: a new literary genre and a potential tool for
   encouraging empathy in medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy has been re-discovered as a desirable quality in
   doctors. A number of approaches using the medical humanities have been
   advocated to teach empathy to medical students. This paper describes a
   new approach using the medium of creative writing and a new narrative
   genre: clinical realism.
   Methods: Third year students were offered a four week long Student
   Selected Component (SSC) in Narrative Medicine and Creative Writing. The
   creative writing element included researching and creating a character
   with a life-changing physical disorder without making the disorder the
   focus of the writing. The age, gender, social circumstances and physical
   disorder of a character were randomly allocated to each student. The
   students wrote repeated assignments in the first person, writing as
   their character and including details of living with the disorder in all
   of their narratives. This article is based on the work produced by the
   2013 cohort of students taking the course, and on their reflections on
   the process of creating their characters. Their output was analysed
   thematically using a constructivist approach to meaning making.
   Results: This preliminary analysis suggests that the students created
   convincing and detailed narratives which included rich information about
   living with a chronic disorder. Although the writing assignments were
   generic, they introduced a number of themes relating to illness,
   including stigma, personal identity and narrative wreckage. Some
   students reported that they found it difficult to relate to ``their{''}
   character initially, but their empathy for the character increased as
   the SSC progressed.
   Conclusion: Clinical realism combined with repeated writing exercises
   about the same character is a potential tool for helping to develop
   empathy in medical students and merits further investigation.}},

Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Neurosurgeons are often identified with traits such as arrogance and
   hubris. However, the true legacy of neurosurgeons is excellence. Harvey
   Cushing, the pioneering neurosurgeon of the United States, is largely
   responsible for this legacy of excellence. Eminent personalities have
   agreed that sincere and hard work is necessary to achieve excellence.
   Excellence in neurosurgery in the domains of surgical work and research
   will be discussed in the article. Excellence in surgical work should be
   measured comprehensively and over long follow-up periods using tools
   such as functional outcomes and quality of life instruments besides
   morbidity and mortality. For excellence in neurosurgical research, one
   can use the help of indices such as the h-index and i10 index. No single
   measure, whether for surgical excellence or excellence in research,
   however, incorporates a measure of qualities such as empathy, integrity
   and mentorship. These intangible qualities should be an integral part of
   the assessment of a neurosurgeon and his/her work. Cushing's attributes
   of meticulous record keeping, attention to detail, and maximal
   utilization of opportunities should guide us in our pursuit of
   excellence. In recent years, it has been suggested that excellence is
   not the result of an innate talent but can be aspired to by anyone
   willing to adopt a work ethic that involves several hours of
   ``deliberate practice,{''}feedback and passion. Neurosurgeons should
   continue to pursue the legacy of Cushing especially in present times
   when medical professionals are frequently depicted as being driven more
   by avarice than by Hippocratic principles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze the attitude of primary care (PC) physicians in
   Spain regarding the approach, diagnosis and treatment of erectile
   dysfunction (ED).
   Material and method: Descriptive study based on two questionnaires
   filled out by 544 PC physicians who regularly treat patients with ED
   where they shared their perception about issues relating to the
   diagnosis and treatment of ED, and how to improve its underdiagnosis and
   undertreatment. Questions were rated using a continuous 1 to 7 Likert
   scale.
   Results: Among mates aged >= 20 for whom there was a record of ED,
   prevalence of the condition was 4.4\%. ED is considered a very important
   health issue and a sentinel symptom. ED is not usually included in the
   medical record (26.5\%) and physicians address the condition more often
   in the presence of risk factors, especially with the concomitant intake
   of drugs. Male doctors appear to have more empathy for men with ED, but
   they do not appear to diagnose the condition with more frequency than
   their women counterparts. Age does not appear to influence diagnosis.
   The lack of time and training are the main barriers for a correct
   approach. Training is required to improve the underdiagnosis. ED is
   usually treated when it is associated to disorders at this level of
   healthcare.
   Conclusions: Actions are needed to help improve the diagnosis of ED in
   Spain, which in turn will allow early detection of underlying
   comorbidities and improve the health and quality of life of the patient.
