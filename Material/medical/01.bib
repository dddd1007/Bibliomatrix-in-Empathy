Title = {{That's not what you expect to do as a doctor, you know, you don't expect
   your patients to die.{''} Death as a learning experience for
   undergraduate medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Experiencing the death of a patient can be one of the most
   challenging aspects of clinical medicine for medical students. Exploring
   what students' learn from this difficult experience may contribute to
   our understanding of how medical students become doctors, and provide
   insights into the role a medical school may play in this development.
   This research examined medical students' responses of being involved
   personally in the death of a patient.
   Method: Ten undergraduate medical students were followed through their
   three years of clinical medical education. A total of 53 individual
   semi-structured interviews were conducted. Grounded theory analysis was
   used to analyze the data.
   Results: Students illustrated a variety of experiences from the death of
   a patient. Three main themes from the analysis were derived: (i)
   Students' reactions to death and their means of coping. Experiencing the
   death of a patient led to students feeling emotionally diminished, a
   decrease in empathy to cope with the emotional pain and seeking
   encouragement through the comfort of colleagues; (ii) Changing
   perceptions about the role of the doctor, the practice of medicine, and
   personal identity. This involved a change in students' perceptions from
   an heroic curing view of the doctor's role to a role of caring, shaped
   their view of death as a part of life rather than something traumatic,
   and resulted in them perceiving a change in identity including dampening
   their emotions; (iii) Professional environment, roles and
   responsibilities. Students began to experience the professional
   environment of the hospital by witnessing the ordinariness of death,
   understanding their role in formalizing the death of a patient, and
   beginning to feel responsible for patients.
   Conclusions: Along with an integrative approach to facilitate students
   learning about death, we propose staff development targeting a working
   knowledge of the hidden curriculum. Knowledge of the hidden curriculum,
   along with the role staff play in exercising this influence, is vital in
   order to facilitate translating the distressing experiences students
   face into worthwhile learning experiences. Finally, we argue that
   student learning about death needs to include learning about the social
   organization and working life of clinical settings, an area currently
   omitted from many medical education curricula.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To validate the Korean Version of the Jefferson Empathy Scale
   for Health professionals (K-JSE-HP) in a sample of Korean nurses.
   Methods: Internal consistency reliability, construct and criterion
   validity were calculated using SPSS (22.0) and AMOS (22.0). Data were
   collected from 253 nurses (230 women, 23 men) working at one university
   hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Results: The Korean version of JSE-HP
   showed reliable internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha for the total
   scale of .89, and .74 similar to.84 for sub scales. The model of three
   subscales for the K-JSE-HP was validated by confirmatory factor analysis
   (chi(2)=864.60, Q=6.55, p<.001, CFI=.94, NNFI=.92). Criterion validity
   compared to the Interpersonal Reaction Index (IRI) showed significant
   correlation. Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that the
   Korean JSE-HP shows satisfactory construct and criterion validity and
   reliability. It is a useful tool to measure Korean nurses' empathy.}},

   among all 402 members.
   RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 161 of 402 (40\%) readers and
   50 of 122 (41\%) writers. Readers found many benefits; 84\% reported
   learning ``a lot{''} about how a colleague handled a certain clinical
   situation, while 79\% found that the reflective writing listserve helped
   them feel more connected to colleagues. A total of 83\% reported that
   reading the weekly story positively affected their empathy and patient
   centeredness. Those who reported reading the stories most often were
   more likely to report achieving the most benefits. The majority of
   respondents who wrote stories agreed with all suggested benefits of
   writing; 73\% reported that writing allowed them to celebrate a
   patient/research/teaching encounter that they were proud of, and 72\%
   reported that it gave them better perspective or clarity about a patient
   experience ``a lot{''} of the time.
   CONCLUSIONS: As departments struggle with provider burnout and feelings
   of being overwhelmed and disconnected, strategies like a reflective
   writing listserve may be a means to improve support and inspire
   clinicians and learners to feel fulfilled.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed empathy in medical residents, including factors modifying
   empathy and the relationship between empathy and burnout. Participants
   (n = 317 residents, response rate = 42\%) from 4 university hospitals
   completed a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Jefferson Scale of
   Empathy (Health Professional version, Korean edition), and the Maslach
   Burnout Inventory (MBI). Participants were classified by medical
   specialty: ``people-oriented specialty{''} (POS group) or
   ``technology-oriented specialty{''} (TOS group), with more women in the
   POS than in the TOS group, chi(2) = 14.12, P < 0.001. Being female,
   married, and having children were factors related to higher empathy
   (gender, t = -2.129, P = 0.034; marriage, t = -2.078, P = 0.038;
   children, t = 2.86, P = 0.005). Within specialty group, POS residents
   showed higher empathy scores in the fourth as compared to the first
   year, F = 3.166, P = 0.026. Comparing POS and TOS groups by year, fourth
   year POS residents had significantly higher scores than did fourth year
   TOS residents, t = 3.349, P = 0.002. There were negative correlations
   between empathy scores and 2 MBI subscales, emotional exhaustion (EE)
   and depersonalization (DP). Additionally, first year POS residents had
   higher DP scores than did first year TOS residents, t = 2.183, P =
   0.031. We suggest that factors important for empathy are type of medical
   specialty, marriage, siblings, and children. Burnout state may be
   related to decreasing empathy.}},

Abstract = {{The literature consistently shows that medical-surgical nurses
   frequently lack the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to render
   holistic nursing care to patients with severe mental illness (SMI). The
   negative perceptions often portrayed by medical-surgical nurses towards
   SMI patients with comorbid medical-surgical disorders must be addressed
   in order to ameliorate treatment gaps. Current concepts, issues, and
   challenges associated with the perceptions of nurses who care for
   patients with (SMI) in medical-surgical settings can prove overwhelming
   to both nurses and patients, and can result in concerning practice gaps.
   In accordance with a contemporary model of patient-centered care, it is
   imperative that medical-surgical nurses acquire the knowledge, skills,
   and attitudes necessary to work with this high-risk population.
   Cultivating an environment that promotes apposite attitudes along with
   effective training programs for medical-surgical nurses, may shift
   negative perceptions and ultimately meet best practice standards and
   improve outcomes for patients with SMI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Aims and objectivesThis study investigated nurse practitioners' clinical
   decision-making abilities and the factors that affect these abilities.
   BackgroundNurse practitioners play an important role in clinical care
   decision-making; however, studies exploring the factors that affect
   their decision-making abilities are lacking.
   DesignA cross-sectional descriptive survey was employed.
   MethodsA purposive sample of 197 nurse practitioners was recruited from
   a medical centre in central Taiwan. Structured questionnaires consisting
   of the Knowledge Readiness Scale, the Critical Thinking Disposition
   Inventory and the Clinical Decision-Making Model Inventory were used to
   collect data.
   ResultsThe intuitive-analytical type was the most commonly used
   decision-making model, and the intuitive type was the least frequently
   used model. The decision-making model used was significantly related to
   the nurse practitioners' work unit. Significant differences were noted
   between the nurse practitioners' clinical decision-making models and
   their critical thinking dispositions (openness and empathy). The nurse
   practitioners' years of work experience, work unit, professional
   knowledge and critical thinking disposition (openness and empathy as
   well as holistic and reflective dispositions) predicted the nurse
   practitioners' analytical decision-making scores. Age, years of nurse
   practitioner work experience, work unit and critical thinking
   disposition (holistic and reflective) predicted the nurse practitioners'
   intuitive decision-making scores.
   ConclusionsThis study contributes to the topic of clinical
   decision-making by describing various types of nurse practitioner
   decision-making. The factors associated with analytic and intuitive
   decision-making scores were identified. These findings might be
   beneficial when planning continuing education programmes to enhance the
   clinical decision-making abilities of nurse practitioners.
   Relevance to clinical practiceThe study results showed that nurse
   practitioners demonstrated various clinical decision-making types across
   different work units. Consideration of nurse practitioners' knowledge
   readiness and their specific needs while planning on-duty education
   programmes is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are useful for assessing
   health care quality and safety and patients' perceptions of health care.
   We aimed to assess the relationship between PREMS {[}e.g., measures of
   patient-centered care (PCC)] and health care quality metrics.
   We conducted a national survey via mail. Survey data were supplemented
   with US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) administrative data.
   Veteran (n = 5512) VA health care users participated in the study.
   PCC measures included: patient activation; shared decision-making (SDM);
   empathy and holistic care; chronic illness care; perceptions of
   participation, respect for choices, and support; and overall health care
   experience. Health care quality measures included: preventive care
   screening receipt; chronic condition management (diabetes,
   hypertension); and health care utilization (hospitalizations, emergency
   room (ER) visits). Analyses included: bivariate comparisons of PCC
   measures by health care quality measures; and multivariate linear
   regression to identify variables associated with attaining multiple
   positive health care quality indicators (when controlling for potential
   confounders).
   PREMs assessing factors relating to patient-provider communication
   (e.g., empathic provider care, shared decision-making) are mainly
   related to clinical indicators representing good chronic condition
   management, while those relating more broadly to health care in general
   (e.g., patient activation, chronic illness care) are mainly related to
   measures of appropriate health care use (e.g., preventive care screening
   receipt; potentially avoidable hospitalizations; unscheduled care, such
   as ER visits). When controlling for potential confounders, higher
   perceptions of the decision-making effectiveness component of SDM (beta
   = 0.004, p = 0.03) and empathy and holistic care (beta = 0.01, p = 0.02)
   showed a weak but positive relationship with attaining a greater number
   of positive health care quality indicators, while a weak but negative
   relationship emerged for perceptions of participation, respect for
   choices, and support (beta = -0.003, p = 0.03) and overall VA
   experiences (beta = -0.10, p = 0.04).
   PREMs that measure PCC offer rich data about health care quality while
   engaging patients, and considering patient experiences and preferences,
   in performance assessment. PREMs may be used to supplement existing
   performance metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Equality of access to organ transplantation is a
   mandatory public health requirement. Referral from a local to a
   university hospital and then registration on the national waiting list
   are the two key steps enabling access to liver transplantation (LT).
   Although the latter procedure is well defined using the Model for
   End-stage Liver Disease score that improves equality of access, the
   former is mostly reliant on the practices of referring physicians. The
   aim of this study was to clarify the factors determining this initial
   step. Methods: This observational study included consecutive inpatients
   with cirrhosis of whatever origin in a cohort constituted between 2003
   and 2008, using medical records and structured questionnaires concerning
   patient characteristics and the opinions of hospital clinicians.
   Candidates for LT were defined in line with these opinions. Results:
   Four hundred and thirty-three patients, mostly affected by alcoholic
   cirrhosis, were included, 21.0\% of whom were considered to be
   candidates for LT. Factors independently associated with their
   candidature were: physician empathy {[}odds ratio (OR) = 10.8; 95\% CI:
   4.0-29.5], adherence to treatment (OR = 16.6; 95\% CI: 3.7-75.2),
   geographical area (OR = 6.8; 95\% CI: 2.2-21.3) and the patient's
   physiological age (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.1-4.7). Conclusions: Several
   subjective markers restrict the referral of patients from local
   hospitals to liver transplant centres. Their advancement to this second
   step is thus markedly weakened by initial subjectivity. The development
   of objective guidelines for local hospital physicians to assist them
   with their initial decision-making on LT is now necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:
   To explore parents' experiences of ``observed trauma,{''} defined as
   traumatic events, unrelated to their own child, that parents/carers
   witness while in a PICU.
   Design:
   Exploratory qualitative study.
   Setting:
   Nineteen-bed mixed surgical/medical PICU in a tertiary
   university-affiliated children's hospital.
   Participants:
   Parents of 11 children, screened from a total sample of 100 children
   admitted to the PICU for greater than 48 hours.
   Interventions:
   Face-to-face screening interviews were conducted with parents following
   their child's discharge from PICU. Parents who reported observed trauma
   were interviewed a second time to explore their experiences.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   Two questionnaires were designed, one to screen for observed trauma and
   a second one to guide semistructured interviews. Of 100 parents who
   participated in a structured screening interview, 19\% reported observed
   trauma. Of the 19 parents, 11 completed the second interview.
   Significant themes included: involuntary exposure; privacy and
   confidentiality; empathy for children and their families; reflection and
   personal growth; and staff communication.
   Conclusions:
   Observed trauma is not uncommon in the PICU. The results suggest that
   timely support may alleviate the short-term negative impact.
   Furthermore, some parents have reported positive aspects to their
   experience.}},
