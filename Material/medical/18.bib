Abstract = {{Providers of care for children undergoing stem cell transplantation
   (SCT) skillfully combine the roles of scientist and clinician. As
   scientists, they apply scientific methods and disease theory in the
   creation and testing of new therapies and in the careful observation and
   exploration of treatment outcomes. As clinicians, they are capable of
   intuitively delivering care in a patient- and family-centered context of
   meaning and life values.
   The specialty of SCT has inherent aspects that make treatment decision
   making complex and potentially contentious. Having a strategy ready to
   implement in advance or at the time when treatment decisions need to be
   made mill facilitate and enhance the decision making process for both
   the health care team and family members. Here we introduce the
   individualized care planning and coordination (ICPC) model as a
   practical approach to facilitate ethical and effective decision making
   in pediatric SCT settings. The ICPC is a 3-step model comprising (1)
   relationship-understanding the illness experience from the perspective
   of the patient and family, sharing relevant information, and assessing
   ongoing needs; (2) negotiation-prognosticating, establishing goals of
   care, and discussing treatment options; and (3) plan-generating a
   comprehensive plan of care that includes life and medical plans. Based
   on a foundation of a care of competence, empathy, compassion,
   communication, and quality, the ICPC model aims to diminish contentious
   family staff interactions that can lead to mistrust and help guide
   treatment decision making. The ICPC model enhances communication among
   patients, families, and clinicians by revealing patient and family
   values and medical and quality-of-life priorities before reaching or
   even during critical decision points in the transplantation process. (C)

Abstract = {{Facial nerve palsy affects individuals of all ages, races, and sexes.
   Psychological and functional implications of the paralysis present a
   devastating management problem to those afflicted, as well as the
   carriers. Since Sir Charles Bell's original description of facial palsy
   in 1821, Our understanding and treatment options have expanded. It is
   essential that a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing
   ophthalmologists; Ear, Nose, and Throat surgeons; plastic surgeons; and
   psychologists work closely to optimize patient management in a staged
   approach. Although the etiology remains unknown, strong histological,
   cerebral spinal fluid, and radiological evidence suggests a possible
   association with herpes simplex virus in idiopathic facial nerve palsy
   (Bell's palsy). The use of steroids has been suggested as a means of
   limiting facial nerve damage in the acute phase. Unfortunately, no
   single randomized control trial has achieved an unquestionable benefit
   with the use of oral steroid therapy and thus remains controversial. In
   the acute phase, ophthalmologists play a pivotal role in preventing
   irreversible blindness from corneal exposure. This may be successfully
   achieved by using intensive lubrication, medical therapy (botulinum
   toxin), or surgery (upper lid weighting or tarsorraphy). Once the cornea
   is adequately protected and recovery deemed unlikely, longer term
   planning for evelid and facial reanimation may take place in an
   individualized manner. Onset is Sudden and management potentially
   length),. Physician empathy, knowledge, and experience are essential in
   averting long-term lifestyle and psychological discomfort for patients.

Title = {{Life on the receiving end: A qualitative analysis of health providers'
   illness narratives}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{207-213}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Clinical empathy is integral to forging therapeutic
   patient-physician relationships. Illness narratives are a potentially
   rich source of insight into what it feels like to be a patient or
   patient's family member. The authors performed a qualitative analysis of
   illness narratives to develop an explicit framework for understanding
   what it feels like to be a health care recipient and to explore how
   providers' behaviors influence that experience.
   Method The authors used consensual qualitative research, a methodology
   based on principles of grounded theory, to analyze 24 illness narratives
   found in that number of essays from the Annals of Internal Medicine's
   ``On Being a Patient{''} series published between January 1, 1999, and
   December 31, 2003. Trustworthiness was demonstrated via essayists'
   feedback on the analysis.
   Results Patients and their families faced formidable physical and
   psychosocial challenges. Providers' behaviors influenced the illness
   experience in profoundly positive and negative ways, independent of the
   technical quality of care. Consistent with previous studies of
   patient-physician relationships, providers' advocacy for patients and
   expressions of compassion were prominent determinants of patients'
   satisfaction. The experience of simultaneously being a health care
   provider and consumer was an additional source of stress for essayists,
   but it positively influenced their subsequent practice.
   Conclusions Illness narratives vividly illustrate fundamental aspects of
   the illness experience and are a potentially rich resource for
   cultivating empathy. The authors' analysis provides a framework for
   enhancing trainees' and practitioners' ability to understand and meet
   patients' and families' psychosocial needs. The experiences of health
   care recipients with medical backgrounds are uniquely challenging and
   beneficial.}},

Title = {{How do distress and well-being relate to medical student empathy? A

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lower levels of empathy among a sample
   of medical students in the United States are associated with personal
   and professional distress and to explore whether a high degree of
   personal well-being is associated with higher levels of empathy.
   DESIGN: Multi-institutional, cross-sectional survey.
   SETTING: All medical schools in Minnesota (a private medical school, a
   traditional public university, and a public university with a focus in
   primary care).
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,098 medical students.
   MEASUREMENTS: Validated instruments were used to measure empathy,
   distress (i.e., burnout and symptoms of depression), and well-being
   (high quality of life).
   RESULTS: Medical student empathy scores were higher than normative
   samples of similarly aged individuals and were similar to other medical
   student samples. Domains of burnout inversely correlated with empathy
   (depersonalization with empathy independent of gender, all P <.02, and
   emotional exhaustion with emotive empathy for men, P=.009). Symptoms of
   depression inversely correlated with empathy for women (all P <=.01). In
   contrast, students' sense of personal accomplishment demonstrated a
   positive correlation with empathy independent of gender (all P <.001).
   Similarly, achieving a high quality of life in specific domains
   correlated with higher empathy scores (P <.05). On multivariate analysis
   evaluating measures of distress and well-being simultaneously, both
   burnout (negative correlation) and well-being (positive correlation)
   independently correlated with student empathy scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both distress and well-being are related to medical student
   empathy. Efforts to reduce student distress should be part of broader
   efforts to promote student well-being, which may enhance aspects of
   professionalism. Additional studies of student well-being and its
   potential influence on professionalism are needed.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Spirituality is a major domain of palliative medicine
   training. No data exist on how it is taught, nor is there a consensus
   about the content or methods of such education. We surveyed palliative
   medicine fellowship directors in the United States to learn how they
   teach spirituality, who does the teaching, and what they teach.
   Methods: A, PubMed (www.pubmed.gov)) search using the terms
   ``spirituality{''} and ``medical education{''} was completed. Thirty-two
   articles outlined spirituality education content and methods in in
   medical schools and residency programs. From these articles, a survey on
   spirituality education in palliative medicine fellowship training was
   prepared, pilot-tested, revised, and then distributed by e-mail in June
   2004 to the 48 U.S. palliative medicine fellowship directors listed on
   the American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) website,
   but excluding the three fellowship programs represented by the authors.
   Follow up requests were sent by email twice during the 6-week collection
   period. The Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of
   Wisconsin approved the study.
   Results: Fourteen fellowship directors completed the survey (29\% of all
   programs; 42\% of those currently teaching fellows as indicated on the
   AAHPM website). All programs indicated they taught ``spirituality{''};
   12 of 14 had separate programs for teaching spirituality and 2 of 14
   reported they taught spirituality to their fellows but not as a
   distinct, separate program. All respondents taught the definitions of
   spirituality and religion, common spiritual issues faced by patients at
   end of life (which was not defined further), and the role of chaplains
   and clergy. Chaplains provided spirituality education in all of the
   responding programs, but other team members were frequently involved.
   The most common formats for education in the domains of knowledge and
   attitudes were small group discussion, lecture, and self-study. Small
   group discussion, supervision, and shadowing a chaplain or other
   professional were the most common methods used for skills. Faculty
   written or oral evaluations of fellows were the most common forms of
   evaluation, with little evidence of more robust assessment methods, such
   as structured role-play (none of the programs surveyed).
   Conclusions: Palliative medicine fellowship programs generally agree on
   the content of training on spirituality, but have not incorporated
   robust educational and evaluation methods to ensure that fellows have
   obtained the desired attitudes, knowledge, and skills to meet the
   Initial Voluntary Program Standards for Residency Education in
   Palliative Medicine of the American Board of Hospice and Palliative
   Medicine. Based on the survey data and results from the literature
   review, broad recommendations are made to enhance spirituality
   education.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE Patient-centredness should be at the heart of medical education.
   This longitudinal study aimed to assess possible attitude changes
   towards patient-centredness in a medical students' cohort as they
   progressed through the clinical curriculum. It also investigated the
   possible impact of socio-demographic factors on students' attitudes.
   METHODS The same student cohort was tested on 2 occasions: during their
   initial exposure to clinical curricula (year 4) and after 2 years, at
   the end of the clerkship (year 6). Students completed a questionnaire
   including demographics and the 18-item Patient-Practitioner Orientation
   Scale (PPOS). PPOS differentiates between patient-centred versus
   doctor-centred or disease-centred orientation, measuring attitudes along
   2 dimensions: `sharing' and `caring'.
   RESULTS A total of 483 fully completed questionnaires was returned
   (response rate 83\%). The cohort's attitudes were significantly more
   doctor-centred at the end of their studies compared to the beginning of
   their clinical curricula (P < 0.001). However, regarding the caring part
   of their relationship with patients, they maintained a satisfactory
   level of patient-centredness. Concerning sharing information, female
   students were significantly more patient-centred at year 4, with their
   mean score decreasing at the end of their clerkship. Furthermore, among
   only female students, having a looser relationship with religion was
   associated with more patient-centred attitudes.
   CONCLUSIONS Increased authoritarianism in graduating students' attitudes
   emphasises clearly the need for future research and redesigning
   communication curricula. Furthermore, the influence of gender and
   relationship with religion on attitudes towards the doctor-patient
   relationship should be explored further, in order to eliminate
   disparities in the provision of patient-centred medical care.}},

Abstract = {{Conclusion. Our bedside interviews with patients with head neck cancer
   are unique and valuable educational experiences for undergraduate
   medical students. Objective. How can we help medical students to
   understand patients' thoughts and feelings? We believe that students can
   learn and practice empathy at the patient's bedside. Subjects and
   methods. Sixty medical students in their final year at the University of
   Tokyo and 10 patients with head and neck cancer were supervised by a
   professor and senior head and neck surgeons. Questionnaires were
   delivered to each student before and after bedside teaching, to
   investigate their impressions on thoughts and feelings of patients with
   head and neck cancer. Questions to patients were composed of: 1)
   backgrounds: birthplace, education, occupation and hobby; 2) cancer: the
   time of the first visit to clinic and the time of referral to the
   University of Tokyo Hospital; 3) preoperative feelings; 4) impression of
   surgical treatment and postoperative care; and 5) messages to medical
   students from the patient. Medical students also asked additional
   questions. Results. Before the bedside teaching our medical students
   believed that it must be important to listen to patients (100\%); and
   that it must be possible to encourage patients (50\%). After the bedside
   teaching they noticed that a medical interview could have a positive
   influence on the patient (93\%), probably because of general
   conversation (45\%), the patient's personality ( 50\%), listening to
   information about the patient's birthplace, education, occupation and
   hobby (48\%), and the instructor's life experiences (25\%). Most
   patients asked medical students to be good doctors who can understand
   their thoughts and feelings.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{On the theme of Linus Geisler's nine steps for a successful consultation
   between doctor and patient, the ability for self-criticism, the ability
   to be able to listen to oneself and the value of the doctor-patient
   relationship in the context of medical practice will be discussed.
   Subsequently, the framework of the consultation, the consulting room
   atmosphere and the complete setting of the consultation will be dealt
   with. The importance of active listening and the recognition of all
   messages, both verbal and from body language, will be particularly
   emphasized. The capability for empathy is presented as the necessary
   bridge to recognition of the feelings and inner world of the patient.
   Because one only sees what one is looking for and only recognizes what
   one knows, the recognition of typical complaints presented by patients
   in a consultation represents the ``something{''} which must be
   specifically elucidated. The problems and symptoms which the patient
   brings to the doctor are surrounded by a ring of fears and
   apprehensions. For this reason it is decisive to uncover the
   accompanying cloud of fears and apprehensions with appropriate
   questions, to correctly assign the unsettling symptoms of the patient
   and to be able to correctly interpret them. As illustrated by the
   language of nature - the translation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
   triplets into amino acids - the translation of biological, psychological
   and social aspects of the complaints symptomatic into the level of
   diagnosis and the translation of the referential, social and affective
   meaning of the expressions used by the patient, into the level of the
   significance will be discussed. The role of the doctor here is that of a
   producer of context and a skilled translator.
   In the management of functional disorders and chronic diseases the
   construction of a shared reality is important. The therapeutic function
   of consultations is due to an introduction of metaphors as bridges -
   bridges to an improved understanding of the body, the self and the
   world. The role of the physician here is that of a moderator, motivator
   an accompanying person. Finally, Jaspers levels of good doctoring
   (natural science or causal level, nursing level,
   communicative-existential level) are stressed and the importance of a
   good patient-physician relationship for a patient-centered medicine is
   underlined.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Interest in training in psychiatry appears to be in decline.
   To pursue reasons why a career in psychiatry is not regarded as an
   attractive option for trainees, attitudes of senior Australian medical
   students were surveyed. Method: Fifty five medical students from one
   university were set a question inviting them to detail reasons why
   doctors might be less likely to train in psychiatry as part of their
   written examination in psychiatry. Several major themes and salient
   statements were identified from a qualitative analysis. Results:
   Analysis identified several multifaceted factors, including a difficult
   and pressured work environment and lack of resources due to chronic
   underfunding; perceived deficiency of personal skills, such as empathy;
   inadequate income; negative implications of stigma, low prestige, and
   limited patient gratitude and job satisfaction. These issues, coupled
   with the widespread belief that the discipline is unscientific and not
   ``real medicine'', may contribute to later decisions not to pursue
   training in psychiatry. Conclusions: While the framing of the research
   question was biased towards eliciting negative evaluations of a career
   in psychiatry, the responses are nonetheless instructive in helping to
   understand the reasons why potential trainees might be discouraged from
   the field. If psychiatry is to attract high-quality recruits, there is
   clearly a need to address stigmatizing attitudes within the medical
   hierarchy, and provide positive educational experiences for medical
   students that excite their imagination about a career or even a calling
   - as against its negative `job' status.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Animal cruelty is a significant problem for society, and there are good
   reasons why doctors should be particularly concerned by it. Increasing
   evidence for links between animal cruelty and child or spousal abuse is
   an area of growing concern internationally and of real importance to
   health professionals.
   OBJECTIVE
   This article aims to raise awareness of the relevance of animal cruelty
   to medical practice. The links between animal cruelty and human health
   are discussed broadly and some wider ethical issues raised.
   DISCUSSION
   Animal cruelty impacts on human health in disparate ways: intentional
   and unintentional acts of cruelty may reflect underlying mental health
   problems that need to be addressed. Cruelty within the family setting is
   an important sentinel for domestic violence and should prompt an
   assessment for possible child abuse. Furthermore, animal cruelty raises
   important questions about the nature of empathy, and the type of society
   that we wish to live in.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The objective of this study was to compare doctor-patient
   communications in clinical consultations via telemedicine technology to
   doctor-patient communications in face-to-face clinical consultations.
   Method Five doctors who had been practicing internal medicine for 8 to
   18 years, and twenty patients were enrolled in this study; neither
   doctors nor patients had previous experience of telemedicine. The
   patients received both a telemedicine consultation and a face-to-face
   consultation. Three measures - video observation, medical record volume,
   and participants' satisfaction - were used for the assessment.
   Results It was found that the time spent on the telemedicine
   consultation was substantially longer than the time spent on the
   face-to-face consultation. No statistically significant differences were
   found in the number of either closed or open-ended questions asked by
   doctors between both types of consultation. Empathy-utterances,
   praise-utterances, and facilitation-utterances were, however, seen less
   in the telemedicine consultations than in the face-to-face
   consultations. The volume of the medical records was statistically
   smaller in the telemedicine consultations than in the face-to-face
   consultations. Patients were satisfied with the telemedicine
   consultation, but doctors were dissatisfied with it and felt hampered by
   the communication barriers.
   Conclusions This study suggests that new training programs are needed
   for doctors to develop improved communication skills and the ability to
   express empathy in telemedicine consultations.}},

Abstract = {{Whether observation of distress in others leads to empathic concern and
   altruistic motivation, or to personal distress and egoistic motivation,
   seems to depend upon the capacity for self other differentiation and
   cognitive appraisal. In this experiment, behavioral measures and
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to
   investigate the effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal
   while participants observed the facial expression of pain resulting from
   medical treatment. Video clips showing the faces of patients were
   presented either with the instruction to imagine the feelings of the
   patient ({''}imagine other{''}) or to imagine oneself to be in the
   patient's situation ({''}imagine self{''}). Cognitive appraisal was
   manipulated by providing information that the medical treatment had or
   had not been successful. Behavioral measures demonstrated that
   perspective-taking and treatment effectiveness instructions affected
   participants' affective responses to the observed pain. Hemodynamic
   changes were detected in the insular cortices, anterior medial cingulate
   cortex (aMCC), amygdala, and in visual areas including the fusiform
   gryrus. Graded responses related to the perspective-taking instructions
   were observed in middle insula, aMCC, medial and lateral pre-motor
   areas, and selectively in left and right parietal cortices. Treatment
   effectiveness resulted in signal changes in the perigenual anterior
   cingulate cortex, in the ventromedial orbito-frontal cortex, in the
   right lateral middle frontal gyrus, and in the cerebellum. These
   findings support the view that humans' responses to the pain of others
   can be modulated by cognitive and motivational processes, which
   influence whether observing a conspecific in need of help will result in
   empathic concern, an important instigator for helping behavior.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the impact of undergraduate psychiatry placements in primary
   care settings on students' learning and attitudes to mental illness.
   Questionnaire survey and qualitative in-depth interviews.
   A primary care-based psychiatry undergraduate teaching programme at
   Royal Free and University College Medical School, London.
   A total of 145/183 (79.2\%) students attending the primary care-based
   programme over 2 academic years completed a questionnaire survey.
   In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 students, 12 general
   practitioner (GP) tutors and 20 patients participating in the course.
   In the questionnaire survey, 121/144 (84.0\%) students valued the
   primary care-based teaching highly. In total, 87/139 (62.6\%) students
   felt their attitudes to mental illness had changed as a result of the
   course. In-depth interviews demonstrated 4 key benefits of the teaching
   programme: increasing breadth of experience, understanding the patients'
   experience, learning about mental illness from a GP's perspective and
   changing students' attitudes towards mental illness. The students'
   attitudinal shift comprised 2 main dimensions; `normalisation' of mental
   illness and increased empathy.
   Learning psychiatry in primary care settings offers students a broader
   experience of a range of patients than in hospital settings and
   encourages a `person-centred' approach, which in turn can have a
   positive impact on their attitudes to mental illness, reducing
   stereotyping and increasing empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Talking with a family whose child is dying is painful and challenging,
   yet can be a profoundly rewarding aspect of a physician's work. At some
   time, every physician must give patients bad news. If this conversation
   is carried out well, with preparation, compassion, genuine empathy and
   skill, this adds considerably to the physician's capacity to provide
   comprehensive care. Until recently however, there has been little or no
   training for this sensitive and delicate undertaking. Recent research
   indicates that breaking bad news to a family is a trainable skill. Data
   show a high consistency in the desirable traits for good communication.
   These are compassion, clinical accuracy, honesty, and availability. The
   literature emphasizes allowing sufficient time in a quiet private

Abstract = {{Background: Competency-based models of medical education require
   reliable and valid assessment of multiple physician roles.
   Aims: To develop and evaluate an objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) designed to assess 7 physician competencies (CanMEDS
   Roles).
   Methods: Twenty four candidates from 4 neonatal-perinatal medicine
   training programs participated in a 10-station OSCE. Ten 5-point rating
   scales were developed and used to assess the CanMEDS Roles of Medical
   Expert, Communicator, Collaborator, Manager, Health Advocate, Scholar
   and Professional. Three descriptors of performance anchored the ratings.
   For each station, examiners completed appropriate CanMEDS ratings, a
   station-specific binary checklist and an overall process- related global
   rating. Trained standardized patients (SP) and standardized health
   professionals (SHP) completed rating scales that assessed verbal and
   non-verbal expression, empathy and coherence as well as the overall
   global rating.
   Results: Each station incorporated 3-5 physician Roles. Interstation
   alpha was 0.80 for checklist scores and 0.88 for examiners' overall
   global rating. Median interstation alpha for individual CanMEDS ratings
   was 0.72 (range 0.08-0.91). There were significant correlations between
   examiner Medical Expert scores and SP/SHP overall global scores and
   between examiner Communicator scores and 4 SP/SHP assessments of
   communication skills. Second year trainees' CanMEDS scores for each
   competency were significantly higher than those of first year trainees
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The OSCE may be useful as a reliable and valid method of
   simultaneously assessing multiple physician competencies.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{358-364}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study solicits third and fourth year medical students'
   attitudes about and experiences with callousness.
   Methods: Medical students were asked to respond to an on-line survey
   assessing demographic information, their experiences with seeing
   callousness modeled by mentors and their attitudes about callousness.
   Participants included 74 students roughly split on gender and year in
   school.
   Results: A 2 x 2 between-subjects MANOVA was conducted (dependent
   variables-attitudes about and experiences with callousness; independent
   variables-gender and year in school). Significant results were found for
   gender; follow-up analyses revealed that women hold more unfavorable
   attitudes about callousness than men. Although students generally
   regarded callousness as undesirable, they reported seeing callousness
   modeled by their mentors 20\% of the time across a variety of
   situations.
   Conclusions: Students' attitudes about callousness are negative; women's
   attitudes are more negative than men's. Despite this, students
   (regardless of their demographic variations) regularly see it modeled by
   their mentors. Some students' narrative responses suggest they think
   being callous toward patients and colleagues can serve them well in some
   situations. The authors offer several questions to motivate further
   empirical and ethical inquiry into callousness and urge medical
   educators to consider its influence on students' conceptions of
   professionalism.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Background: One of the US government health goals outlined in the
   Healthy People 2010 document (2000) is to increase the number of
   physicians who counsel their patients regarding unhealthy behaviors.
   Studies have shown a low rate of physicians provide smoking cessation
   counseling. We introduced a motivational interviewing curriculum into
   our medical school for first and third year students and then evaluated
   the effect of this curriculum on third year students counseling skills.
   Methods: The motivational interviewing curriculum was comprised of a
   lecture series and small group teaching with practice in role plays. The
   effectiveness of the curriculum was evaluated by student performance in
   a videotaped interview with a standardized patient who portrayed a
   smoker. The interview was rated using the Motivational Interviewing
   Treatment Integrity scoring tool (MITI). The MITI assesses 6 criteria:
   empathy, MI spirit (autonomy, evocation and collaboration), MI adherence
   (asking permission, affirmation, emphasis of control and support), MI
   non adherence (advise, confront and direct), the types of questions
   (open or closed) and the number of reflections. Secondary outcomes
   included a knowledge exam related to motivational interviewing and
   students' evaluations of the effectiveness of the motivational
   interviewing curriculum.
   Results: Analysis of the MITI scores showed that students reached a
   proficiency level on the rate of reflections, were just below
   proficiency in assessment of empathy and motivational interviewing
   spirit and substantially below proficiency in the percent of open ended
   questions. These proficiency scores were for professional counselors but
   nevertheless provided us with information on the effectiveness of the
   new curriculum and where the focus of our teaching should be. On the
   optional evaluation of the first-year MI curriculum by 112 students,
   83\% felt that the MI curriculum had helped them be more comfortable in
   discussing behavior change with patients and 98\% felt it was an
   important skill for physicians to have.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several professional bodies have developed influential
   documents which have tried to describe the essential competences of a
   good doctor. Such an initiative has not been previously conducted in
   German-speaking countries. Differences between the published statements
   point towards the significance of differences in the respective
   sociocultural setting.
   Methods: The first step was to take advantage of a series of
   standardized written interviews {[}including the item,What makes a
   doctor a good doctor?{''}], conducted with leading German physicians and
   published serially in the Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift. Responses
   were qualitatively analysed by three assessors in accordance with
   Grounded Theory. Text fragmentation and assignment of categories was
   built successively: it was based on the actual material and repeatedly
   revised.
   Results: 261 statements were extracted from a total of 83 interviews. It
   was possible to assign 249 of them to one of the following nine
   categories:,knowledge{''},,empathy{''} and,patient orientation{''} and,
   less frequently,practical
   competence{''},,genuineness{''},,helper{''},,awareness of
   limits{''},,life-long learning{''} and,cooperation{''}. Results were
   similar for older and younger physicians, or when comparing
   representatives of clinical and theoretical disciplines.
   Conclusions: It will be worthwhile to survey and evaluate the opinion of
   additional members of the medical profession and of patients and others
   with a stake in the health system - comparing and delineating results
   from different countries - so that a more comprehensive picture can be
   drawn of,,the good doctor{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Medical procedures in outpatient settings have limited options of
   managing pain and anxiety pharmacologically. We therefore assessed
   whether this can be achieved by adjunct self-hypnotic relaxation in a
   common and particularly anxiety provoking procedure. Two hundred and
   thirty-six women referred for large core needle breast biopsy to an
   urban tertiary university-affiliated medical center were prospectively
   randomized to receive standard care (n = 76), structured empathic
   attention (11 = 82), or self-hypnotic relaxation (it = 78) during their
   procedures. Patients' self-ratings at 10 min-intervals of pain and
   anxiety on 0-10 verbal analog scales with 0 = no pain/anxiety at all, 10
   = worst pain/anxiety possible, were compared in an ordinal logistic
   regression model. Women's anxiety increased significantly in the
   standard group (logit slope = 0.18, p < 0.001), did not change in the
   empathy group (slope = -0.04 P = 0.45), and decreased significantly in
   the hypnosis group (slope = -0.27, p < 0.00 1). Pain, increased
   significantly in all three groups (logit slopes: standard care = 0.53,
   empathy = 0.37, hypnosis = 0.34; all p < 0.001) though less steeply with
   hypnosis and empathy than standard care (p = 0.024 and p = 0.018,
   respectively). Room time and cost were not significantly different in an
   univariate ANOVA despite hypnosis and empathy requiring an additional
   professional: 46 min/\$161 for standard care, 43 min/\$163 for empathy,
   and 39 min/\$152 for hypnosis. We conclude that, while both structured
   empathy and hypnosis decrease procedural pain and anxiety, hypnosis
   provides more powerful anxiety relief without undue cost and thus
   appears attractive for outpatient pain management. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Background: Nearly all family physicians have patients that engender a
   sense of frustration or dislike, often described as ``difficult.{''}
   Most research in this area focuses on describing these patients and
   their physicians, not management or coping.
   Objective: To describe how respected family physicians identify, manage,
   and cope with difficult patient encounters.
   Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interview study. Participant
   physicians described as ``excellent{''} were recommended by medical
   school family medicine faculty around the county. Interview questions
   included ``describe the patient you least like seeing,{''} and `` how do
   you keep sane but still assure adequate care for the patient?{''}
   Interviews were analyzed using the editing method, looking for common
   categories and themes.
   Results: 102 physicians were interviewed. Physicians described both
   patient behaviors ( stay sick and demanding) as well as medical problems
   ( multiple, chronic pain, drug seeking, psychiatric) that they found
   frustrating. Difficult encounters occurred when these patient behaviors
   and medical problems clashed with physicians' personal and practice
   traits. Their management strategies to return the encounter to success
   incorporated collaboration, appropriate use of power and empathy.
   Conclusions: We propose a model where clashes between patient behaviors
   and physicians' traits turn a successful encounter of collaboration,
   appropriate use of power and empathy into a difficult encounter of
   opposition, misuse of power and compassion fatigue. Management
   strategies used by our participants aim to return success to the
   encounter and may serve as a guide for practicing physicians and for
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{The expanding number of Americans living with chronic illness
   necessitates educating future physicians about chronic illness care.
   Weill Cornell Medical College's Chronic Illness Care in the Home Setting
   Program (CIC-HSP), a mandatory part of the primary care clerkship,
   exposes medical students to persons with chronic illness via a half day
   of house calls with a geriatrics team. The investigators sought to
   qualitatively assess the effect of the CIC-HSP on medical students and
   recent medical graduates. Fifty-two prospective participants were
   approached, and 50 (96\%) with varying training levels and time since
   completing the program were interviewed.
   Most respondents (63\%) found that the home visits taught them important
   approaches to caring for the chronically ill, such as individualizing
   care to meet patients' individual needs and improving quality of life as
   a goal of care. Students remarked that the experience enhanced their
   empathy (18\%) and sensitivity (20\%) toward chronically ill patients
   and increased their appreciation for chronic illness care (35\%). Many
   participants reported that patients were more empowered in the home
   (55\%) and perceived greater rapport and warmth between the doctor and
   patient (57\%) in the home (vs office) setting. The vast majority of
   recent medical graduates (84\%) related that this educational exposure
   continued to positively influence their approach to patient care.
   A home visit experience with a geriatrics team can help foster medical
   students' understanding of the psychosocial and medical aspects of
   chronic illness, teach relevant approaches to patient care, and improve
   students' attitudes toward caring for the chronically ill.}},

Abstract = {{While the practice of medicine has changed over the years, including
   technological advances, access to medical information, and the narrowing
   of socio-economic and educational gaps between the clinician and his/her
   patients, the importance of the doctor-patient relationship has not
   diminished over time. This can be a very rewarding interaction. However,
   many physicians experience a great deal of anger, inadequacy and
   frustration, and much of the actual practice of medicine may become a
   burden rather than a source of satisfaction. Physicians may encounter a
   subset of patients who engender strong negative feelings, despair and
   even downright malice. An understanding of the ``hateful patient{''} can
   therefore be very informative to the physician. Several categories of
   such patients may be described, and sensitivity to the phenomenon will
   lead to improved physician well-being, less self-destructive patient
   behavior and a lower risk of litigation. Several factors may assist the
   21st century physician in managing the ``hateful patient{''} in an
   empathic manner and in making some sense of why the patient has resorted
   to negative response patterns. Ultimately, a failure to consider these
   issues will result in poorer medical care and, no less important,
   reduced satisfaction of both patients and doctors. The intention of this
   article is to revisit the concept and to place it in the context of
   contemporary medical practice. (C) 2006 European Federation of Internal

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: How can residency programs help trainees address
   conflicting emotions about their professional roles and cultivate a
   curiosity about their patients' lives beyond their diseases? We drew on
   the medical humanities to address these challenges by creating an
   intensive writing workshop for internal medicine residents.
   AIM: To help participants become better physicians by reflecting on
   their experiences and on what gives meaning to work and life. This paper
   describes the workshop and how residents were affected by the focus on
   the craft of writing.
   SETTING: A group of 15 residents from 3 training programs affiliated
   with 1 institution.
   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: We engaged the expertise of physician-writer
   Abraham Verghese in planning and facilitating the 2 and one-half day
   workshop. Residents' submissions were discussed with a focus on the
   effectiveness of the writing. We also conducted a focus group with
   participants to evaluate the workshop.
   PROGRAM EVALUATION: Themes in the writing included dysphoria, impotence
   of the physician, and the healing power of compassion. Our focus group
   data suggested that this workshop served as a creative outlet from the
   rigors of medicine, created a sense of community among participants,
   enhanced both self-awareness and awareness of their patients' lives, and
   increased intra-institutional and extra-institutional interest in
   writing and the residency program.
   DISCUSSION: Teaching creative writing to residents in an intensive
   workshop may deepen interactions with peers and patients, improve
   writing skills, and increase interest in writing and the residency
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure acupuncture patients' perceptions of practitioner
   empathy at the initial consultation and its relationship with patient
   enablement, and prospectively reported changes in symptoms.
   Methods: Fifteen acupuncturists asked consecutive new patients to
   complete a questionnaire within 2 days of the first consultation. The
   questionnaire included the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
   measure (a consultation process measure), the Patient Enablement
   Instrument (PEI, a consultation outcome measure) and the Measure
   Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP), a patient-centred symptom,
   well-being and activity outcome measure. A postal follow-up
   questionnaire was completed at 8 weeks, which repeated these measures.
   Results: Fifty-two patients (58\% of all new patients) completed the
   initial questionnaire. Of these, 41 (79\%) completed the follow-up
   questionnaire. From a multiple regression analysis, which controlled for
   known confounders, empathy was found to be associated with enablement at
   the initial consultation (Beta coefficient = 0.16, 95\% CI: 0.02-0.3 1,
   p = 0.03) and empathy-predicted changes in health outcome (MYMOP) at 8
   weeks (Beta = 0.07, 95\% CI: 0.004-0.13, p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Patients' perception of practitioner empathy was associated
   with patient enablement at initial consultation and predicted changes in
   health outcome at 8 weeks. Practice implications: The empathy of
   practitioners, as perceived by patients, has a direct impact on patient
   enablement and health outcome. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Context Medical errors are associated with feelings of distress in
   physicians, but little is known about the magnitude and direction of
   these associations.
   Objective To assess the frequency of self-perceived medical errors among
   resident physicians and to determine the association of self-perceived
   medical errors with resident quality of life, burnout, depression, and
   empathy using validated metrics.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective longitudinal cohort study
   of categorical and preliminary internal medicine residents at Mayo
   Clinic Rochester. Data were provided by 184 (84\%) of 219 eligible
   residents. Participants began training in the 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and
   2005-2006 academic years and completed surveys quarterly through May
   2006. Surveys included self-assessment of medical errors and linear
   analog scale assessment of quality of life every 3 months, and the
   Maslach Burnout Inventory (depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and
   personal accomplishment), Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and a
   validated depression screening tool every 6 months.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of self-perceived medical errors was
   recorded. Associations of an error with quality of life, burnout,
   empathy, and symptoms of depression were determined using generalized
   estimating equations for repeated measures.
   Results Thirty-four percent of participants reported making at least 1
   major medical error during the study period. Making a medical error in
   the previous 3 months was reported by a mean of 14.7\% of participants
   at each quarter. Self-perceived medical errors were associated with a
   subsequent decrease in quality of life (P=.02) and worsened measures in
   all domains of burnout (P=.002 for each). Self-perceived errors were
   associated with an odds ratio of screening positive for depression at
   the subsequent time point of 3.29 (95\% confidence interval, 1.90-5.64).
   In addition, increased burnout in all domains and reduced empathy were
   associated with increased odds of self-perceived error in the following
   3 months (P=.001, P<.001, and P=.02 for depersonalization, emotional
   exhaustion, and lower personal accomplishment, respectively; P=.02 and
   P=.01 for emotive and cognitive empathy, respectively).
   Conclusions Self-perceived medical errors are common among internal
   medicine residents and are associated with substantial subsequent
   personal distress. Personal distress and decreased empathy are also
   associated with increased odds of future self-perceived errors,
   suggesting that perceived errors and distress may be related in a
   reciprocal cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Legal provisions in The Netherlands and Belgium currently
   allow physicians to actively end a patient's life at his or her request
   under certain conditions. The term that is used for this is
   ``euthanasia.{''} Discussion: The same term, ``euthanasia,{''} was used
   in Germany during the Nazi regime for a program of cleansing the
   ``German nation{''} in which untold thousands of persons were denied
   human empathy or medical care and were thereby condemned to death. The
   medical profession played a leading role in the planning,
   administration, and supervision of this ``euthanasia{''} program, with a
   large proportion of German physicians proactively shirking all moral
   responsibility and ultimately paving the way for the Holocaust.
   Conclusion: The term ``euthanasia{''} was so abused during the Nazi
   regime as a camouflage word for murder of selected subpopulations with
   the willing participation of physicians, we believe that, regardless of
   the benevolent goals of current euthanasia practices, for historical
   reasons the term ``euthanasia{''} must not be used with regards to
   current end-of-life care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Education in Sports Medicine is offered heterogeneously in
   German medical schools. Efficacy and acceptance among medical students
   are unknown. The self-image of sports has changed from a traditional,
   competition-oriented way to adventure, entertainment, wellness and
   health. Therefore changes of our curricula to a practical oriented way
   of teaching are required. In this regard a new curriculum was developed.
   The main focus, besides an interdisciplinary class in sports medicine
   was to offer practical education in sports to the students. Methods:
   Efficacy and acceptance of the class were evaluated using a
   questionnaire. 90 medical students (58 male, 32 female) were included
   into the study. Results: The interdisciplinary topics of the class were
   graded positively. Most of the presentations were regarded as very
   useful for the future practice. Empathy and commitment of the professor
   were keystones to good scores. The ``fun-factor{''} was the key for the
   success of the practical assignment. Practical training was regarded as
   fundamental for a sports medicine class. Discussion: Evaluation of the
   new concept as well as a discussion of the current practice to teach
   sports medicine at medical school confirm the need of a more practical
   oriented education, in order to meet the requirements of sports medicine
   in a time with changing self image of sports.}},

Abstract = {{Background, During the last few years, multiple new medical schools have
   emerged in Chile, associated to the constant preoccupation to provide a
   good quality medical care. This created the need to evaluate medical
   training programs and to open a discussion about the attributes that a
   good physician should have. Aim: To evaluate the medical student's
   perception of the ideal medical doctor profile. Material and methods: An
   analytical, descriptive and cross sectional study was designed. Eleven
   second year, 11 third year, nine fourth year, 13 fifth year, 6 sixth
   year and 8 seventh year students were studied. Data collection was
   gathered by focus groups. Codes and triangulation were used for data
   analysis. Results: As attitudes and moral-ethical values, students
   valued the absence of discrimination a listening attitude and empathy,
   Among job related issues, they valued responsibility and punctuality.
   Emotional and legal self-care were valued as self related attitudes.
   Among skills, competences and capacities, a value was given to
   communicational skills, team work and professional easiness. Knowledge
   about medical and non medical topics was appraised. The valued
   attributes among duties and activities were patient diagnosis. treatment
   and education, team leadership and continuous medical training.
   Conclusions: These findings should help to design new curricula for
   medical schools (Rev Med Chile 2006; 134: 947-54).}},

Title = {{Communication skills competencies: definitions and a teaching toolbox}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Doctors' interpersonal and communication skills correlate
   with improved health care outcomes. International medical organisations
   require competency in communication skills. The Accreditation Council
   for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) developed a toolbox for assessing
   this competency and 5 others, yet none initially for teaching these
   skills.
   PURPOSE AND METHODS The original focus in the development of the ACGME
   competencies was evaluation. This paper represents a significant step
   toward defining methods for teaching communication skills competencies.
   A total of 16 medical education leaders from medical schools worldwide,
   participating in the 2003 Harvard Macy Institute Program for Physician
   Educators, worked together to: (1) further define the ACGME competency
   in interpersonal and communication skills; (2) delineate teaching
   strategies for each level of medical education; and (3) create a
   teaching toolbox to integrate communication skills competencies into
   medical curricula. Four subgroups defined subcompetencies, identified
   teaching strategies for undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate medical
   training and brought their work to the larger group. The expanded
   communication competencies and teaching strategies were determined by a
   consensus of the larger group, presented to 80 Harvard Macy Scholars and
   Faculty for further discussion, then finalised by consensus.
   CONCLUSION The teaching toolbox expands the ACGME core communication
   competencies, adds 20 subcompetencies and connects these competencies to
   teaching strategies at each level of medical training. It represents the
   collaboration and consensus of a diverse international group of medical
   education leaders in a variety of medical specialities and institutions,
   all involved in teaching communication skills. The toolbox is applicable
   globally across different settings and specialities, and is sensitive to
   different definitions of health care.}},

Title = {{Improving compliance in depression: a systematic review of narrative

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{253-260}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background and objective: Narrative reviews represent a popular source
   of information for clinicians, especially where the evidence on a given
   subject is sparse and analogies from other fields of medicine may help
   in filling the information gap. Unfortunately, narrative reviews often
   follow less stringent criteria for information selection and appraisal
   than systematic reviews, potentially leading to incomplete or biased
   recommendations. The objective of the present study was to examine the
   quality of the recommendations provided by narrative reviews on how to
   improve patient adherence to pharmacological treatment of unipolar
   depressive disorders.
   Method: We sought to locate all narrative review papers addressing
   adherence to treatment in unipolar depressive disorders. In order to do
   so, we searched Medline and PsychInfo from 1980 to December 2003, using
   the following keywords: review, depressive disorders, treatment,
   dropout, patient compliance and adherence. We inspected the title and
   the abstract, whenever available to identify the relevant reviews and
   obtained a full copy of the publications in this subset, and read the
   articles to identify further relevant reviews. These were in turn copied
   and reviewed, until no further references were found.
   Results and discussion: We identified 23 reviews, providing a total of
   87 recommendations. The most common recommendation was for patient
   education (19 times), patient-physician empathy/alliance (14 times), and
   education of family (nine times). Reviewers' recommendations were based
   on the literature on depression 54 times, and on other medical
   conditions 17 times. A critical appraisal of the evidence base of the
   recommendations showed that randomized controlled trials or
   meta-analyses were quoted to support the recommendations only 23\% of
   the times, while important interventions of proven efficacy in the field
   of depression or in other chronic conditions (e.g. medication clinics,
   training of nurses, psychological treatment, and telephone follow-up)
   were not mentioned.
   Conclusions: Narrative reviews on adherence to pharmacological treatment
   of depressive disorders suffer not only from the limited availability of
   good quality evidence, but also from an incomplete critical appraisal of
   available evidence on interventions both for depression and for other
   chronic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Physician power has been attacked, and tabooed, in legitimate efforts to
   strengthen patients' rights. Yet the structural and symbolic power
   wielded by doctors is what makes good and right healing actions
   possible. Avoiding the power issue contributes to a confusing state,
   where patient trust is faltering and physicians are uncertain about how
   to fulfill the doctor's role with the intellectual tools of mere science
   and technology. I argue that constitutive characteristics of health,
   illness, and the clinical encounter necessitate a prescriptive and
   responsible healing agent who is more than a technocrat, an information
   broker, or a seller. The article proposes clinical leadership as a
   concept offering practical and ethical direction to clinicians,
   education, research, and health policy. Leadership presupposes
   reflective awareness of physicians' structural and symbolic power, and
   is displayed as discerning, empowering improvisations in critical
   situations, based on empathy and willingness to learn from patients. The
   notion of clinical leadership highlights patient vulnerability,
   medicine's ethical core, and the importance of character development in
   medical education.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{447-453}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Medical education faces challenges in training empathetic
   doctors who have good patient communication skills. The author aimed to
   understand insights that doctors who become patients may gain concerning
   ways to improve doctor-patient relationships and communication in order
   to improve medical education.
   Method From 1999 to 2002, based in New York, the author conducted two
   in-depth, semistructured, two-hour interviews with each of 50 doctors
   who had serious illnesses concerning their overlapping experiences of
   being health care workers and becoming patients. Interviews examined
   their views about these issues and how their perspectives changed as a
   result of patienthood.
   Results
   These doctor-patients questioned whether and to what degree empathy
   could be taught, but nonetheless provided several techniques for
   improving communication with patients related to process and content of
   care. Processes included charting at the bedside rather than at the
   nursing station, acknowledging having kept patients waiting, and
   increasing awareness of nonverbal aspects of care. Content issues
   included communicating directly about taboo topics and being more
   sensitive in discussing ``bad news,{''} adherence, and nonmedical
   concerns.
   Conclusions
   Doctors reported increased sensitivity to patients' experiences and
   empathy in doctor-patient communication. These findings can help in
   teaching doctors to see more clearly that their specific point of view
   differs from that of patients, and can be limiting. This study also
   sheds light on the wide separation between intellectual and experiential
   learning, which needs to be addressed further in medical education and
   research.}},

   accreditation. To validate the novel items we generated to assess
   professionalism, we tested whether residents' ratings of faculty they
   judged as outstanding in professionalism would be distinguishable from
   those they judged as not outstanding.
   Methods: Educators from core clinical disciplines generated 20 items
   assessing professionalism behaviors on a 7-point frequency scale
   anchored by ``always{''} and ``never.{''} Thirty-five Surgical and
   pediatric residents completed the form twice, anonymously rating 1
   faculty member they judged as Outstanding and another they judged as not
   outstanding.
   Results: The residents produced 69 faculty ratings with means that
   differed significantly on all items between the outstanding and
   not-outstanding faculty. The form was highly unidimensional, with the
   primary factor's eigenvalue being 11.5 and Cronbach's alpha being 0.9.7.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Empathy in the medical setting is appreciation of the
   patient's emotions and expression of that awareness to the patient.
   Named as an essential learning objective by the American Association of
   Medical Colleges, empathy is believed to significantly influence patient
   satisfaction, adherence to medical recommendations, clinical outcomes,
   and professional satisfaction. The objective of this study was to
   identify effective strategies to enhance empathy in undergraduate
   medical students.
   DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed for studies that address the
   effectiveness of strategies for teaching empathy to medical students. We
   identified 13 peer-reviewed, English language, qualitative and
   quantitative studies reporting primary data on interventions that aim to
   foster empathy in undergraduate medical students, using Medical Subject
   Heading terms education, medical, undergraduate or student, medical
   crossed with empathy.
   RESULTS: These studies indicate that empathy may be amenable to positive
   change with a range of interventional strategies. Communication skill
   workshops addressing the behavioral dimension of empathy show greatest
   quantitative impact on participants. However, current studies are
   challenged by varying definitions of empathy, small sample sizes, lack
   of adequate control groups, and variation among existing empathy
   measurement instruments.
   CONCLUSION: Given the methodological limitations of the available
   studies, and uncertainty about which dimensions of empathy should be
   addressed, larger studies using validated measurement tools are
   recommended.}},

Title = {{The aging game: Improving medical students' attitudes toward caring for
   the elderly}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a modified aging game to enhance medical students'
   attitudes toward caring for elderly patients, enhance empathy for
   elderly patients, and improve general attitudes toward the elderly.
   Design: Preintervention and postintervention study
   Participants and Setting: All 84 students from 2 first-year medical
   school classes
   Intervention: The aging game takes place over a period of 3 hours with a
   group of 10 to 12 students and 5 to 6 facilitators, and includes
   experiential learning about polypharmacy, medication cost, loss of
   functional status, semi-independent living, and living in a long-term
   care facility.
   Measurements: Scores obtained through a modified Maxwell and Sullivan
   questionnaire, and the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD).
   Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in 6 of the 8
   attitudes toward caring for elderly and a statistically significant
   increase in empathy towards elderly patients following the aging game.
   There was a statistically significant change on 23 out of 32 ASD
   questions. There was no evidence of differences in the scores from
   pre-course to post-course by gender age group, interest in
   Family/Internal Medicine, or prior geriatric experience. Following the
   game, 77 (93\%) of the students said they would take the course if not
   mandatory (P =.0001). A majority stated the aging game added
   significantly (61.5\%) or moderately (37.3\%) to their knowledge and
   skills in patient care for the elderly.
   Conclusion: A simulation experience like the aging game is an effective
   method of increasing the empathy and attitudes toward caring for the
   elderly early in the medical school curriculum. Longitudinal assessment
   of the effect of the aging game in maintaining the positive effect on
   empathy and attitudes toward caring for the elderly and especially in
   clinical practice needs to be done.}},

Title = {{CQI-2 - a new measure of holistic interpersonal care in primary care
   consultations}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The Consultation Quality Index (CQI) is a holistic quality marker for
   GPs based on patient enablement, continuity of the care and consultation
   length.
   Aim
   To evaluate the CQI-2, a new version of the CQI incorporating a process
   measure of GP empathy (the Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure).
   Design of study
   Cross-sectional questionnaire study.
   Setting
   General practice in the west of Scotland.
   Method
   Empathy, enablement, continuity, and consultation length were measured
   in 3044 consultations involving 26 GPs in 26 different practices in the
   west of Scotland. CQI-2 scores were calculated and correlated with
   additional data on GPs' and patients' attitudes. Comparisons were also
   made with the UK-wide data from which the original CQI had been
   calculated.
   Results
   CQI-2 scores were independent of deprivation, access, demographics, and
   case-mix. GPs with lower CQI-2 scores valued empathy and longer
   consultations less than these GPs with higher CQI-2 scores. `Below
   average CQI-2' GPs (those in the bottom 25\%) also felt less valued by
   patients and colleagues. Patients' showed less confidence in and gained
   less satisfaction from these doctors. Data ranges from the study were
   comparable with the UK data ranges used to construct the original CQI.
   Conclusions
   The CQI-2 is a new measure of holistic interpersonal care. In a small
   but representative sample of GPs it appears to differentiate between
   below and above average doctors. CQI-2 scores may reflect important
   aspects of morale, core values and patient-centred care. There may be
   potential for its use as part of professional development and as a
   component of the general medical services contract.}},

Title = {{Medical students' perceptions of their learning about the doctor-patient
   relationship: a qualitative study}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To describe and discuss Year 5 medical students' perceptions
   of their own learning about the doctor-patient relationship.
   METHODS We carried out a qualitative study of semi-structured interviews
   with 16 Year 5 medical students using 3-way analysis at the School of
   Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   RESULTS For experiences at the pre-clinical stage, the subcategories
   were: positive aspects of the medical psychology course; great distance
   between theory and reality, and strong desire for clinical practice. For
   experiences at the clinical stage, the subcategories were: demand for
   opportunities to discuss the doctor-patient relationship; teachers as
   either role models or anti-models; clinical situations favourable for
   developing empathic relationships, and clinical situations unfavourable
   for developing empathic relationships. For views about future
   experiences, the subcategories were: apprehension about ethical
   behaviour; anxiety about handling patients' psychosocial
   characteristics, and fear of professional ethics cases or legal action.
   DISCUSSION To compensate for the lack of practical activities during the
   pre-clinical stage, students search for extracurricular activities that
   often overload them. Because teachers function as professional role
   models, their attitudes towards patients have great importance. Students
   fear not being able to maintain their empathic capacity in the future
   because of work-related issues. Knowledge of the psychological aspects
   of the doctor-patient relationship helps students to comprehend their
   experiences. Gradual contact between student and medical practice from
   the beginning of the course is advised. It should be followed by
   interdisciplinary discussions that deal with the technical aspects of
   cases and the doctor-patient relationship.}},
