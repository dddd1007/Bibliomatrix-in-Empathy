Abstract = {{The ethics of caring, though the subject of much recent discussion by
   philosophers, has hardly been applied to medical ethics and medical
   education. Based on receptivity (that is, empathy and compassion) toward
   and taking responsibility for other persons, the ethics of caring has
   particular relevance to medicine. Caring guides the physician always to
   remain the patient's advocate and to maintain the therapeutic
   relationship when dealing with and resolving ethical dilemmas. This
   article discusses the philosophy behind the ethics of caring and then
   explores three issues that arise within its context: receptivity, taking
   responsibility, and creating an educational environment that fosters
   caring.}},

Title = {{Nurse-patient communication in cancer care - A review of the literature}},
Journal = {{CANCER NURSING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{20-31}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Patients with cancer seem to experience distress particularly in the
   First period after diagnosis, and are likely to develop an affective
   disorder in the first 2 to 3 months. Communicative behaviors of nurses
   seem to play an important role in meeting the cognitive and affective
   needs of patients with cancer. This review of the literature examines
   the communicative behaviors of nurses during care activities with
   patients who have cancer. The studies show that emphasis is placed on
   the affective side, in which facilitating behaviors such as empathy,
   touch, comforting, and supporting are considered essential in caring for
   patients with cancer. Unfortunately, further studies in this review
   demonstrate that communication in oncologic care is complicated by such
   emotionally laden issues as the consequences associated with the
   life-threatening character of the disease and the far-reaching
   consequences of the medical treatment. This results in barriers to
   effective communication between patients with cancer and nurses. It is
   important, therefore, that nurses working with patients who have cancer
   are provided both structurally and repeatedly with continuing education
   programs in communication. Finally most of the studies covered in this
   review have an explorative character. Future research in this area
   should pay attention to the use of controlled studies, large sample
   sizes, and observational instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study examined the extent to which physicians expressed
   empathy and positiveness to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients
   during primary care visits. Methods: Twenty-seven family practice and
   internal medicine resident physicians at the University of New Mexico
   Health Sciences Center were audiotaped in 1995 with 427 adult patients
   who were fluent in English or Spanish. The tapes were reviewed and
   organized to measure how frequently physicians expressed empathy and
   positiveness to patients. Results: Physicians expressed empathy at equal
   rates to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. When examining only
   Hispanic patients, physicians were significantly more likely to express
   empathy to patients who they knew better Physicians expressed
   positiveness to non-Hispanic white patients more often than to Hispanic
   patients. When examining only Hispanic patients, physicians were more
   likely to express positiveness to patients who they knew better who
   rated their health better and who were more educated. When examining
   only non-Hispanic white patients, physicians were more likely to express
   positiveness to older and male patients than to younger and female
   patients. Also, female and younger physicians were significantly more
   likely to express positiveness to non-Hispanic white patients than male
   and older physicians were. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that the
   resident physicians expressed empathy equally well to Hispanic and
   non-Hispanic white patients but that resident physicians need further
   training on how to express positiveness to patients from different
   ethnic backgrounds, especially Hispanic patients.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the outcome of communication skill teaching for entry-lever

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{90-94}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background While the literature shows the clinical value for medical
   practitioners of skill in communicating with patients in an empathetic
   manner, objective evaluations of methods to teach empathy are few.
   Purposes This paper describes a method of teaching entry-level medical
   students the elements of effective communication with patients, in
   preparation for their first practical exercises. The paper focuses on
   how the outcomes of the teaching were evaluated with special attention
   to empathy.
   Methods Student evaluative ratings were collected after training, and
   students also completed a pencil-and-paper test of empathy, both before
   and after the training. While all data were anonymous, student pre- and
   post-training empathy scores could be compared to assess individual
   changes in knowledge of empathy after training.
   Results Most students (81\%) felt better prepared to interview after the
   training. The pencil-and-paper measure of empathy has good reliability,
   both internal (alpha 0.83 and 0.91) and inter-rater (kappa 0.96).
   Overall, students made significant gains in their ability to make
   empathetic responses, although some (30\%) showed no gains.
   Conclusions Further research is required to identify students who fail
   to acquire skill in expressing empathy after undergoing training, and to
   validate the pencil-and-paper measure of empathy against real-life
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Courses in medical ethics, bioethics, and other humanities subjects
   flourish in professional schools, yet a tension exists about whether

   and virtues professed by the medical community, such as fidelity,
   compassion, empathy, respect, and other qualities that will make
   students not only better professionals but also better and more humane
   people. Others reject this role, arguing that humanities courses should
   teach students the knowledge and skills to become better problem solvers
   regarding theoretical, moral, and social issues; they regard it to be
   counterproductive, presumptuous, or futile to try to make students
   better persons. The author examines the extent to which these views are
   incompatible, arguing that a cogent philosophy of education can be
   neither value-free nor fully independent of moral choices. Within
   limits, diverse approaches to incorporating values in teaching can be a

Abstract = {{The Web empowers a diverse population of users and this is reflected in

   you what it really feels like and what to expect next, in a way that
   only someone with personal experience can. A study of the messages from
   an on-line medical support group shows that empathy is an essential

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{489-492}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objectives The importance of professional attitudes in medical care has
   long been recognized; however, medical training has not stressed
   attitude development until recently. In previous studies among medical
   students, we found that gender and specialty preference are important
   factors in attitudes. In this study, patient-centredness of trainees in
   general practice and surgery and of final-year clerks preferring one of
   these specialties was assessed in one medical school in The Netherlands.
   The effect of gender, specialty and training level on attitude was
   investigated.
   Design In 1995, attitudes of 37 general practice trainees, 31 surgery
   trainees and 120 clerks were measured anonymously using questionnaires
   containing the Doctor-Patient Scale. This attitude scale measures
   patient-centredness vs, doctor-centredness. Response rates were 78\%,
   58\% and 84\%, respectively.
   Setting University of Utrecht.
   Subjects Medical students.
   Results Attitudes were related to specialty. General practice;trainees
   showed more patient-centredness than surgery trainees. In accordance
   with previous findings among younger students, no differences were found
   between final-year clerks and vocational trainees. In contrast to
   previous studies, gender was not related to patient-centredness.
   Conclusions Professional attitudes, in particular patient-centredness,
   seem to be related to specialty preference in the final year of graduate
   medical training and specialty as a career choice. It remains unclear
   whether professional socialization reinforces existing attitudes or
   whether existing attitudes result in specialty preference.}},

   those college students who aim to be physicians, both because the
   medical curriculum is becoming more humanistic (which a liberal
   education would support) and because three enormous challenges confront
   physicians and educators alike: the relentless tide of biomedical
   discoveries, the great financial burden that medical care imposes, and
   the public's desperate plea for physicians who are more caring and
   communicative. A liberal education-meaning a course of study that is
   largely unrestricted and that attempts to sample the entire breadth of
   human knowledge-can help the premedical student cultivate, ripen, and
   enrich fundamental proficiencies such as accurate recording of
   observations, communicating ideas well, dealing with human emotions and
   becoming sensitive to human frailties, learning to listen and respond
   appropriately, learning to make sound judgments, and cultivating empathy
   and compassion. These are all skills that a liberal education can help
   the young student learn early rather than late, skills that prepare the
   student for dealing later with complex social, ethical, and clinical
   issues as a physician.
   A liberal education also can help prepare the student to take advantage
   of other general educational opportunities that are available in the
   small, closed community of a residency, such as learning to both assume
   and delegate responsibility, to participate in rational debate while
   respecting the opinions of others, and to exercise mature judgment,
   civility, empathy, and compassion.
   While a liberal education will not necesssarily make the student a more
   technically proficient doctor, for some it will be essential to awaken
   and sharpen those essential skills that a physician needs to rise to the
   top of a profession that never fails to recognize excellence and
   humanity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a psychometrically sound
   patient-satisfaction-with-physician questionnaire that can be used in an
   outpatient oncology setting.
   Patients and Methods: The questionnaire was developed by a four-step
   process involving a total of 277 cancer patients, The item-generation
   process utilized input from 95 oncology outpatients, three medical
   researchers, and the relevant literature. Items were tested by 70 of the
   above patients, Initial item reduction was achieved by input from
   another eight patients, Factor analysis and validity testing used data
   derived from a different group of 174 oncology outpatients, Convergent
   validity was tested by correlating the Princess Margaret Hospital
   Patient Satisfaction with Doctor Questionnaire (PMH/PSQ-MD) with Rubin
   et al's Physician subscale of the Patient's Viewpoint Questionnaire
   (PS-PVQ) and Smith et al's Patient-Doctor Interaction Scale (PDIS),
   Divergent validity was tested by comparing these questionnaires with
   Spitzer's quality of life (QOL) questionnaire.
   Results: The final PMH/PSQ-MD is a 29-item self-administered
   questionnaire with four response categories and a ``does not apply{''}
   category, Four domains were confirmed by factor analysis: (1)
   information exchange, (2) interpersonal skills, (3) empathy, and (4)
   quality of time. The questionnaire hers on overall Cronbach's alpha of
   0.97; the values for each domain are, respectively, 0.92, 0.90, 0.88,
   and 0.88, The PMH/PSQ-MD correlated well with both the PDIS and the
   PS-PVQ (P < .001 for both), Divergent validity was confirmed with
   Spitzer's QOL questionnaire.
   Conclusion: The PMH/PSQ-MD is an outpatient satisfaction questionnaire
   specific to the patient-physician interaction that has shown excellent
   internal consistency, is feasible, and has strong support for validity
   in this oncology population.

Abstract = {{Service-learning at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy
   began with the implementation of volunteer service opportunities which
   developed over three years into co-curricular service-learning. This
   report describes the development and integration of service-learning
   into the curriculum. Initially, a pharmacy faculty member established a
   relationship with care providers and administrators of two programs
   serving low-income communities, a summer camp for children in a housing
   project and a program providing free medical care to homeless and
   low-income patients. Pharmacy students participated in both projects;
   some volunteered while others formally registered for course credits.
   Survey results revealed that students perceived that the experience
   enhanced their AACP outcome competencies in the areas of clinical
   knowledge/skills, communication and interpersonal skills, empathy,
   professionalism, and social awareness. These results led to the
   implementation of an eight-hour/semester service requirement for
   second-year students in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. One hundred
   students completed this requirement for the Fall, 1997, and Spring,
   1998, semesters. During the 1998-99 academic year, changes were made to
   further integrate service-learning into the curriculum. First-year
   students were required to participate in eight hours of community
   service per month, and second-year students assisted pharmacists in free
   clinics serving homeless and low-income patients once per semester.
   Although service-learning demands the commitment of faculty time and
   resources, it is feasible and valuable to integrate service-learning
   into a PharmD curriculum.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Research conducted in primary care settings has demonstrated
   that effective communication enhances patient recall of information,
   compliance, satisfaction, psychologic well-being, and biomedical
   outcomes. However, surgeons face communication challenges that are
   unique to the surgical situation. This study provides the first
   description of routine communication Between community-practicing
   surgeons ann their patients.
   Methods. Audiotapes of 676 routine office visits with 29 general
   surgeons and 37 orthopedic surgeons were coded for structure and
   content. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data is supplemented by
   illustrative examples of dialog selected to represent typical patterns
   of communication.
   Results. The mean visit length was 13 minutes. Surgeons talked more than
   patients, with typical surgical cal consultations containing relatively
   high amounts of patient education and counseling. Consultations had a
   narrow biomedical focus with little discussion of the psychologic
   aspects of patient problems. The affective tone of visits was generally
   positive, with few instances of overt criticism or disagreement by
   either party. However, surgeons infrequently expressed empathy toward
   patients, and social conversation was brief.
   Conclusions. The study underscores the differences in Both the content
   and process of routine surgical visits compared with primary care
   visits. On the basis of this work, it seems particularly important for
   surgeons to develop skills that enhance patient education and
   counseling. Further research is needed to understand the influences of
   surgeons' communication on patient behavioral, psychologic, and
   biomedical outcomes.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{14-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives There has been little evaluation, by means other than
   cognitive variables, of medical school curricula that include
   problem-based learning (PBL). This study aimed to investigate whether
   medical students' affect tolerance, an important prerequisite of
   empathy, was influenced by individual courses.
   Design The study is pseudo-randomised and cross-sectional, using a test
   of affect tolerance in students in their first, sixth and eighth term of
   medical school, during which they were kept together as one group for
   their pre-clinical studies, but were subsequently separated during the
   clinical part and were sent to two different university hospitals that
   used different teaching methods.
   Subjects Medical students.
   Setting University of Lund Medical School, Sweden.
   Results After receiving a short course in communications skills
   training, students in the sixth term had significantly higher mean
   scores on the test than students in their first term. In the eighth
   term, which is the surgery term, the mean scores for students attending
   the PBL course were still as high as those for students in the sixth
   term, while students in the course using conventional pedagogical
   methods had significantly lower mean scores.
   Discussion Since the content of the courses was similar and the
   composition of the two groups also fairly similar, we attribute the
   difference to the differing teaching methods. In the PBL course, the
   students were given continued and integrated communication skills
   instruction, in which it was possible for them to learn strategies to
   counteract the development of rigid psychic defences, which constitute
   an obstacle to affect tolerance and empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Dialogue medicine is presented as the prime means of understanding
   patients' illnesses. It is a practical attitude especially aimed to
   assist or inspire patients to consider, see and manage their
   illness-demanding efforts to unwittingly suppress or disguise such
   self-reproaching thoughts as are worse to bear than the feeling of being
   afflicted with a disease. Along with diagnosing patients' perceived
   bodily disorders, doctors can choose to see them as persons whose
   ailments stand for efforts to manage their existence as communicative
   human beings. The core of the paper is an encounter between the author
   and a female patient which illuminates the usefulness of genuine
   dialogue in medical practice. The paper illustrates how the dialogical
   attitude helps patients to see and manage their difficult
   life-situations and how the doctor can be inspired to change and develop
   and improve his/her skills as a dialogue partner. Doctors' dialogical
   attitude in the encounter encompasses for example openness, empathy,
   sensitivity, courage, attentiveness and responsiveness, accompanied by
   concern, trust, respect, affection, appreciation and hope. The
   philosophical and theoretical foundations of the concept of dialogue
   medicine are sketched out and some practically significant traits are

Abstract = {{The purpose of Nonviolent or Empathic Communication Training is to
   facilitate the flow of information necessary for people to work
   cooperatively and resolve differences effectively. Such training is
   widely used in medical communities where the communication with patients
   and the cooperation between team members are of critical importance for
   the effectiveness of the treatment. Communication skills are of
   particular importance for health care providers dealing with patients
   having chronic diseases such as haemophilia. In addition to the
   difficulties inherent to the chronicity of the disease, the HIV
   contamination has dramatically impaired the relationships between
   patients and health care providers, creating a lot of pain, still alive
   in both parties. The purpose of this presentation is to offer to health
   care providers and patients some tools to deal with their feelings and
   restore effective, compassionate and fulfilling communication.}},

Abstract = {{Medical educators have always recognized the need to teach and train
   medical graduates and undergraduates the skills of conducting a

   perceptions' of the feedback process used in the Junior Paediatric
   Clerkship at the Faculty of Medicine of the United Arab Emirates
   University. An unexpected 73\% of the respondents believed that
   self-observation influenced development of their clinical skills. More
   than 80\% said that the feedback from instructors and peers helped them
   to improve their clinical skills, but they would have liked to have more
   than one of their consultations recorded and reviewed. It was found that
   75\% of the students felt that self-critique of their performance made
   them aware of their strengths and weaknesses and their skills in
   analysing and evaluating consultations had been enhanced. It was found
   from Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA that the students' professional
   attitude, empathy, and warmth towards the patients differed highly
   significantly (P = 0.0062, 0.0089, 0.0007, respectively) from

Abstract = {{Compliance with medical advice has always been a problem and there has
   always been discussion on who is to blame for noncompliance: the
   illness, the physician, the patient or the drug? A consensus between the
   physician's beliefs, views and representations of the nature and the
   etiology of the depression and of the treatment options on the one hand
   and the patient with his individual life story on the other is probably
   the best guarantee of reasonable compliance. In particular, a
   physician-patient consensus about the emotional meaning of the illness
   is essential: patients should be given the opportunity to express their
   feelings about the illness and what it signifies, and physicians should
   respond with feedback using the patient's concepts and emotional
   expression. Within this context of dialogue, patients may signal their
   resistance to and potential noncompliance with the physician's views. An
   empathic model of understanding can be used in the initial stages of the
   consultation. Finding an equilibrium between the cognitive-informational
   aspects of depressive illness and treatment on one hand and
   affective-motivational aspects on the other is a key factor in
   antidepressive treatment. Physicians should indeed always try to
   overcome the gap between the affective (empathy, motivational aspects)
   and the instrumental dimensions (correct diagnosis, adequate treatment)
   of their behavior. (C) 1998 Rapid Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Suffering is a universal experience. In everyday practice, physicians
   and patients confront and deal with this phenomenon. It is surprising
   that, despite its obvious and inexorable presence, there is no universal
   understanding of the real significance of suffering. In the same
   context, it seems that ``the measure of suffering{''} could be an
   option, an instrument, for evaluating the efficacy of treatment. No
   doubt, it is easier to compare laboratory or x-ray results than to
   follow clinically the severity of the disease. However, patients do not
   understand this language, and, often, physicians do not explain to
   patients how they determine that treatment is efficacious. Ln fact, it
   is common to hear patients complain that they do not feel better despite
   the doctors' opinion that they should.
   Often, we must accept that our capabilities are limited and must offer
   some help to mitigate our patients' suffering. Empathy, and the
   responsibility of doctors to understand the different meanings of
   suffering, can help patients. Because of their skills, because they know
   the meaning of disease, and because of their commitment, doctors are
   obliged to comprehend the position of the patients who are suffering. In
   the middle of the storm of science, doctors need to look for disease in
   the voices and in the eyes of their patients. In fact, there should be
   no conflict between science and empathy. The magic link must rest in the
   intelligence and sensitivity of doctors.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the application of technology to promote more
   comprehensive clinical education in the biopsychosocial aspects of
   primary care. Comprehensive refers to the inclusion, in addition to
   scientific and technical knowledge, of knowledge that is less easily
   characterized, quantified, and taught: empathy, intuition, the
   demonstration of artistry. Clinical education will be increasingly
   facilitated by the proliferation of computers capable of displaying
   combinations of text, graphics, video, and sound; broadband networks
   capable of delivering these multiple media to the home or office; and
   new methods for using these technologies for education and training.
   However, current models for technology-based learning are limiting,
   lagging behind the rapid technological evolution driving our entry into
   the Information Age. Some recent educational models (Schon's
   reflection-in-action and reflective practicums {[}1], Boisot's E-space
   {[}2], Kolb's learning cycle {[}3]) provide for a more comprehensive and
   complete view of health professional education. This article describes
   these models in depth and proposes a new model for technology-based
   clinical training, the ``Virtual Practicum,{''} based on them. The
   Virtual Practicum is illustrated with a new interactive CD-ROM program,
   dealing with primary care of patients with HIV/AIDS. The concepts
   presented here are generally useful in thinking about clinical
   education, regardless of the means used.}},

Title = {{Assessment of empathy in a standardized-patient examination}},
Journal = {{TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{8-11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy has long been thought to be an important
   characteristic of a good physician, and a measure of empathy is needed
   to provide feedback to medical students, residents, and physicians on
   this important aspect of their clinical performance. The
   standardized-patient-resting format provides a simple but intuitvely
   convincing approach to the assessment of empathy.
   Purpose: To determine the extent to which 4th-year medical students were
   checked ``empathic{''} by standardized patients (SPs) on a
   performance-based examination, to evaluate the psychometric properties
   of this simple empathy measure, and to see whether empathy was related
   to clinical performance on history taking and physical examination.
   Method: Analyses were performed on examination data for 1,048 senior
   medical students in the 8 member schools of the New York City Consortium
   tested at The Morchand Center of Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
   Results: The percentage of students who were checked ``empathic{''}
   ranged from 59\% to 98\% (M = 79\%) across the 7 SP cases. Of the 1,048
   students, 268 (26\%) were checked ``empathic{''} on all 7 cases;
   however, 221 (21\%) were checked on less than or equal to 4 cases, 90
   (9\%) on less than or equal to 3 cases, and 26 (3\%) on less than or
   equal to 2 cases. The generalizability coefficient of the overall
   empathy scores was .43; the dependability index with cutoff was .81 for
   detecting students checked ``empathic{''} on fewer than half of the 7
   cases. The correlations of the empathy item with the other checklist
   items suggest that the empathy construct refers to behaviors that make
   the patient feel comfortable and important. Also, students who were
   checked ``empathic{''} on fewer than half of the 7 cases performed lower
   on history taking and physical examination.
   Conclusions: Empathy appears to be reasonably acceptable in this sample
   of students, although it is of concern that on average, more than 200
   students per case were not seen as empathic, and more than 200 were
   checked ``empathic{''} on less than or equal to 4 of the 7 cases. These
   results show the potential usefulness of this simple measure of empathy
   and illustrate the need for feedback to address any problems.}},
