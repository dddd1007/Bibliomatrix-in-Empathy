Abstract = {{Aims and objectivesTo report an integrative review of evidence relating
   to dignity-conserving care in palliative care settings. It will also
   suggest avenues for future research.
   BackgroundResearch suggests that dignity is welcomed by those receiving
   palliative and end of life care. However, as dignity is a subjective
   term, it is not always explicit how this may be employed by nurses.
   Given that the preferred place of care for patients with palliative care
   needs is the home, the issue of dignity may be particularly important
   for community nurses. Therefore, synthesising evidence of
   dignity-conserving care for community nurses caring for people with
   palliative care needs provides clarity in a complex area of palliative
   care research.
   DesignIntegrative literature review.
   MethodThe review involved key bibliographic and review databases CINAHL,
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASSIA and PsycInfo. Medical Subject Headings and free
   terms were undertaken for articles published from January 2009-September
   2014 and retrieved papers were assessed against inclusion criteria.
   Final included articles were reviewed for reported dignity-conserving
   care actions, which were classified under nine themes of the Dignity
   Model.
   ResultsThirty-one articles were included. Nine Dignity Model themes were
   used to classify care actions: Level of Independence; Symptom Distress;
   Dignity-Conserving Perspectives; Dignity-Conserving Practices; Privacy
   Boundaries; Social Support; Care Tenor; Burden to Others; and Aftermath
   Concerns. Reported care actions included listening, conveying empathy,
   communication and involving patients in care.
   ConclusionCare actions could be classified under most of Dignity Model
   themes. However, there were less reported care actions related to Level
   of Independence and Aftermath Concerns, which meant that these had to be
   formulated independently. Future research should be structured around
   these areas to determine appropriate care actions for nurses to give
   dignity-conserving care that addresses these specific themes.
   Relevance to clinical practiceSynthesising the available evidence of
   dignity-conserving care identifies evidence-based care actions and
   provides guidance to nursesin clinical practice caring for patients with
   palliative care needs. Future opportunities for research are identified
   to guide promotion of dignity in palliative care.}},

Abstract = {{Narrative medicine educational interventions may enhance
   patient-centered care, yet most educational interventions do not involve
   actual patient-provider interactions, nor do they assess narrative
   competence, a key skill for its practice. An experiential narrative
   medicine curriculum for medical students was developed and piloted.
   The purpose of the study was to develop narrative competence, practice
   attentive listening, and stimulate reflection.
   Participants were third-year medicine clerkship students.
   The curriculum involved 1) an introductory session, 2) a patient
   storytelling activity, and 3) a group reflection session. For the
   storytelling activity, students elicited illness narratives in
   storytelling form from patients, listened attentively, wrote their
   versions of the story, and then read them back to patients.
   Five student focus groups were conducted between July 2011 and March
   2012 (n = 31; 66 \%) to explore students' experiences, student-patient
   dynamics, challenges, and what they learned. Patient interviews (n = 17)
   on their experience were conducted in January 2013. Thematic analysis of
   the audiotaped stories of ten patients and corresponding student-written
   stories helped gauge narrative competence.
   The curriculum was found to be feasible and acceptable to both patients
   and students. Some patients and students were profoundly moved. Ongoing
   focus groups resulted in continual process improvement. Students'
   stories showed attainment of narrative competence.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Assessment of interpersonal and psychosocial competencies
   during end-of-life care training is essential. This study reports the
   relationship between simulation-based end-of-life care Objective
   Structured Clinical Examination ratings and communication skills, trust,
   and self-assessed empathy along with the perceptions of students
   regarding their training experiences.
   Method: Medical students underwent simulation-based end-of-life care
   OSCE training that involved standardized patients who evaluated
   students' communication skills and physician trust with the Kalamazoo
   Essential Elements Communication Checklist and the Wake Forest Physician
   Trust Scale. Students also completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy. Pearson correlation was used to examine the relationship
   between OSCE performance grades and communication, trust, and empathy
   scores. Student comments were analyzed using the constant comparative
   method of analysis to identify dominant themes.
   Results: The 389 students (mean age 26.6 +/- 2.8 y; 54.5\% female) had
   OSCE grades that were positively correlated with physician trust scores
   (r = 0.325, P < 0.01) and communication skills (r = 0.383, P < 0.01).
   However, OSCE grades and self-reported empathy were not related (r =
   0.021, P = 0.68). Time of clerkship differed for OSCE grade and
   physician trust scores; however, there was no trend identified. No
   differences were noted between the time of clerkship and communication
   skills or empathy. Overall, students perceived simulation-based
   end-of-life care training to be a valuable learning experience and
   appreciated its placement early in clinical training.
   Conclusions: We found that simulation-based OSCE training in palliative
   and end-of-life care can be effectively conducted during a surgery
   clerkship. Moreover, the standardized patient encounters combined with
   the formal assessment of communication skills, physician trust, and
   empathy provide feedback to students at an early phase of their
   professional life. The positive and appreciative comments of students
   regarding the opportunity to practice difficult patient conversations
   suggest that attention to these professional characteristics and skills
   is a valued element of clinical training and conceivably a step toward
   better patient outcomes and satisfaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Background and Overview. Narrative medicine strives toward a humanized
   form of medicine in which empathy and the ability to listen are
   developed with the same emphasis as scientific rigor. We hypothesize
   that the adoption of narrative medicine in dentistry would be an
   excellent method to cultivate the philosophy behind the emerging
   clinical concept of patient-centered dentistry.
   Conclusions. Reading literary works, reflective writing, and creative
   writing would sensitize practitioners to the daily lives of people,
   human uniqueness, and alterity. Narrative dentistry could lead to more
   empathic and self-aware practices, and improve dental professionals'
   observational abilities by making them more perceptive and more
   attentive to image, metaphor, and meaning.
   Practical Implications. The introduction of narrative dentistry would
   enrich the clinical clerkship of dentists by bringing the often-missing
   humanities to the dental professional, academic, and scientific

Abstract = {{Background: Medical student professionalism education is challenging in
   scope, purpose, and delivery, particularly in the clinical years when
   students in large universities are dispersed across multiple clinical
   sites. We initiated a faculty-facilitated, peer small group course for
   our third year students, creating virtual classrooms using social
   networking and online learning management system technologies. The
   course emphasized narrative self-reflection, group inquiry, and peer
   support.
   Methods: We conducted this study to analyze the effects of a
   professionalism course on third year medical students' empathy and
   self-reflection (two elements of professionalism) and their perceptions
   about the course. Students completed the Groningen Reflection Ability
   Scale (GRAS) and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) before and after
   the course and provided anonymous online feedback.
   Results: The results of the JSE before and after the course demonstrated
   preservation of empathy rather than its decline. In addition, there was
   a statistically significant increase in GRAS scores (p<0.001),
   suggesting that the sharing of personal narratives may foster reflective
   ability and reflective practice among third year students.
   Conclusion: This study supports previous findings showing that students
   benefit from peer groups and discussion in a safe environment, which may
   include the use of a virtual group video platform.}},

Abstract = {{Doctor-parent communication is considered essential in pediatric daily
   medical practice.
   A survey was carried out using a questionnaire to assess the
   communication habits of pediatric residents and pediatricians in German
   children's hospitals in order to collate the number and length of daily
   doctor-patient consultations in relation to the severity of the patient
   illness. Moreover, the frequency of aggressive behavior from parents and
   the physicians' emotional perception of daily doctor-parent
   consultations were also surveyed.
   A total of 302 questionnaires were returned. The participants were
   attendees at the revision course offered by the German Society of
   Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine (DGKJ) as well as delegates at the
   residents' convention of the Professional Association of Pediatricians
   (BVKJ). Among the responses received 31 \% were from male and 69 \% from
   female doctors. The professional experience of the participants was as
   follows: 106 participants had 2-5 years experience, 69 had 5-10 years
   experience and 83 had a medical experience of more than 10 years. Of the
   participants 84 \% had never had professional training in communication
   skills and 96 \% thought that such training is of great importance.
   Of the participants 77 \% performed 10-40 doctor-parent consultations
   per day. In cases of uncomplicated diseases conversations required 2-10
   min; however, in cases of chronically ill children more than 15 min were
   required. All doctors have experienced aggressive behavior from parents
   during doctor-parent consultations; 15 \% reported having had such
   experiences up to twice a week, while 45 \% had them up to twice a
   month. Pediatric residents have an emotionally more negative perception
   of doctor-parent consultations. They experience more stress and have
   less appreciation during the consultations and hence have less interest
   in them. Parents with chronically ill children received longer
   doctor-parent consultations if the treating doctor had a more positive
   emotional perception of such conversations. This difference was
   statistically significant.
   Regular engagement with the subject of communication in the medical
   practice leads to a higher job satisfaction among doctors. Pediatric
   residents and pediatricians should therefore receive professional
   training in communication skills, which would enable them to cope better
   with the manifold challenges in the daily routine.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical care is laden with emotions, from the perspectives of both
   clinicians and patients. It is important that emotions are addressed in
   health professions curricula to ensure that clinicians are humane
   healers as well as technical experts. Emotions have a valuable and
   generative role in health professional ethics education.
   The authors have previously described a narrative ethics pedagogy, the
   aim of which is to develop ethical mindfulness. Ethical mindfulness is a
   state of being that acknowledges everyday ethics and ethically important
   moments as significant in clinical care, with the aim of enabling
   ethical clinical practice. Using a sample narrative, the authors extend
   this concept to examine five features of ethical mindfulness as they
   relate to emotions: (1) being sensitized to emotions in everyday
   practice, (2) acknowledging and understanding the ways in which emotions
   are significant in practice, (3) being able to articulate the emotions
   at play during ethically important moments, (4) being reflexive and
   acknowledging both the generative aspects and the limitations of
   emotions, and (5) being courageous. The process of writing and engaging
   with narratives can lead to ethical mindfulness, including the capacity
   to understand and work with emotions. Strategies for productively
   incorporating emotions in narrative ethics teaching are described. This
   can be a challenging domain within medical education for both educators
   and health care students and thus needs to be addressed sensitively and
   responsibly. The potential benefit of educating health professionals in
   a way which addresses emotionality in an ethical framework makes the
   challenges worthwhile.}},

Abstract = {{Problem
   Medical students experience transformative personal and professional
   changes during medical school. The medical education community has much
   to learn about how students perceive these changes, which can be
   dramatic and profound.
   Approach
   Over the past six years (2009-2014), the author has taught a course on
   medical graphic narratives (or comics) to fourth-year medical students.
   Comics synergistically combine words and images to tell stories and
   provide an effective vehicle for helping students reflect on and give
   voice to varied experiences. In this course, students critically read
   and discuss medically themed comics and create their own original comic
   depicting a formative experience from medical school.
   Outcomes
   To date, 58 students have taken the course, and each has produced an
   original comic. The author conducted a thematic analysis of their comics
   and identified the following themes: (1) how I found my niche, (2) the
   medical student as patient, (3) reflections on a transformative
   experience, (4) connecting with a patient, and (5) the triumphs and
   challenges of becoming a doctor. Pre/post course assessments indicate
   that students believe creating a comic can significantly improve a
   variety of doctoring skills and attitudes, including empathy,
   communication, clinical reasoning, writing, attention to nonverbal cues,
   and awareness of physician bias. Students' comics reveal the impact of
   formative events on their professional identity formation.
   Next Steps
   Medical educators should explore additional ways to effectively
   integrate comics into medical school curricula and develop robust tools
   for evaluating their short-and long-term impact.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Mind-Body Medicine Facilitation on Affirming and Enhancing
   Professional Identity in Health Care Professions Faculty}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{780-784}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Problem
   Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSOM) offers medical students
   a course in mind-body medicine (MBM) that introduces them to tools that
   reduce stress and foster self-awareness. Previous studies reported
   decreases in students' perceived stress and increases in
   mindfulness-changes that were associated with increased empathic concern
   and other elements of professional identity formation. However, no
   reports have described the impact of an MBM course on the facilitators
   themselves.
   Approach
   To explore whether MBM facilitation is associated with changes in
   professional identity, self-awareness, and/or perceived stress, 62
   facilitators, trained by the GUSOM MBM program, were invited to complete
   two validated surveys: the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the
   Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Forty-two participants also completed a
   six-item openended questionnaire addressing their experience in the
   context of their professional identity.
   Outcomes
   Facilitators' scores were significantly lower on PSS and higher on FMI
   compared with normative controls (P < .05), and the two parameters were
   inversely correlated (-0.46, P < .01). Qualitative analysis revealed
   three main themes: (1) aspects of professional identity (with subthemes
   of communication; connections and community; empathy and active
   listening; and self-confidence); (2) self-care; and (3) mindful
   awareness.
   Next Steps
   Preliminary findings will be extended with larger studies that examine
   longitudinal quantitative assessment of communication, connection, and
   self-confidence outcomes in MBM facilitators, and the impact of MBM
   facilitation on burnout and resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The stress faced by a family member impacts the whole
   family. Disease is a stressor that creates crises within families.
   Purpose: This study explores the perceived needs of the families of
   hospitalized patients in critical care units in the city of Arak, Iran.
   Methods: This study used a qualitative design and a content analysis
   approach. After purposeful sampling, semistructured interviews were held
   with 16 participants.
   Results: Using constant comparative analysis, one main theme and eight
   subthemes emerged from the data. The main theme was ``addressing the
   disruption in family life.'' The subthemeswere ``not being fully
   informed,'' ``not receiving empathy,'' `' feeling insecure,'' ``being
   mentally unstable,'' ``being concerned about their patient's future,''
   ``being dissatisfied with the lack of facilities for the families of
   patients,'' ``dealing with financial problems,'' and ``having turbulence
   intrude on family life.''
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: The findings of this study
   underscore that it is important for medical teams to carefully identify

Title = {{Communicating under medical patriarchy: gendered doctor-patient
   communication between female patients with overactive bladder and male
   urologists in Hong Kong}},
Journal = {{BMC WOMENS HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gender differences between patients and doctors markedly
   influence the quality of communication in treatment processes. Previous
   studies have shown that communication between patients and doctors of
   the same gender is usually more satisfactory, particularly for female
   patients. However, in Hong Kong, where urology is a male-dominated
   specialty, female patients typically require medical care from male
   doctors for diseases such as overactive bladder (OAB). The literature
   about gender-related doctor-patient communication predominantly involves
   people in non-Chinese communities, with few studies conducted with
   Chinese populations. However, the differences between Western and
   Chinese cultures are expected to result in different treatment and
   communication experiences. Furthermore, OAB has received little
   attention in many Chinese communities; few studies in the literature
   address the communication quality between OAB patients and their
   urologists in Chinese communities, particularly regarding female OAB
   patients' experiences when seeking treatment from male urologists. This
   study, therefore, investigated the doctor-patient communication between
   female OAB patients and male urologists in Hong Kong.
   Methods: This study adopted a qualitative research approach by
   conducting semistructured interviews with 30 female OAB patients on an
   individual basis from April 2012 to July 2012. The participants were
   purposively sampled from a patient self-help group for OAB patients in
   Hong Kong.
   Results: The participants' communication experiences with male
   urologists were unpleasant. Embarrassment, feelings of not being treated
   seriously, not being understood, and not being given the autonomy to
   choose treatment approaches prevailed among the participants.
   Furthermore, the perceived lack of empathy from their urologists made
   the participants' communication experiences unpleasant.
   Conclusions: The gender and power differential between the participants
   and their urologists, which was contributed by the social and cultural
   values of patriarchy and doctors' dominance in Hong Kong, made the
   participants' communication with the urologists unpleasant and
   difficult. Poor doctor-patient communication can endanger patients'
   treatment compliance and thus the treatment outcome. Although altering
   such social and cultural values would be difficult, providing
   complementary chronic care services, such as nurse-led clinics as well
   as support and sharing from patient self-help groups, might be a
   possible solution.}},

Abstract = {{Impairment in empathy has been demonstrated in patients with
   schizophrenia and individuals with psychosis proneness. In the present
   study, we examined the neural correlates underlying theory of mind (ToM)
   and empathy and the relationships between these two social cognitive
   abilities with schizotypy. Fifty-six first-year college students (31
   males, 25 females) between 17 and 21 years of age (M = 19.3, SD = 0.9)
   from a medical university in China participated. All participants
   undertook a comic strips functional imaging task that specifically
   examined both empathy and ToM. In addition, they completed two
   self-report scales: the Chapman Psychosis Proneness scale and the
   Interpersonal Responsivity Index (IRI). Results showed that both empathy
   and ToM conditions of the task were associated with brain activity in
   the middle temporal gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the
   precuneus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, we found
   positive correlations between negative schizotypy and brain activity in
   regions involved in social cognition, namely, the middle temporal gyrus,
   the TPJ, as well as the medial prefrontal gyrus. These findings
   highlight that different dimensions of schizotypy may show different
   associations with brain regions involved in social cognitive abilities.
   More importantly, the positive correlation between brain activity and
   anhedonia suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms in high-risk
   populations.}},

Title = {{Metasynthesis of Youth Suicidal Behaviours: Perspectives of Youth,
   Parents, and Health Care Professionals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Youth suicide is a major public health issue throughout the world.
   Numerous theoretical models have been proposed to improve our
   understanding of suicidal behaviours, but medical science has struggled
   to integrate all the complex aspects of this question. The aim of this
   review is to synthesise the views of suicidal adolescents and young
   adults, their parents, and their healthcare professionals on the topics
   of suicidal behaviour and management of those who have attempted
   suicide, in order to propose new pathways of care, closer to the issues
   and expectations of each group.
   Methods and Findings
   This systematic review of qualitative studies-Medline, PsycInfo, Embase,
   CINAHL, and SSCI from 1990 to 2014-concerning suicide attempts by young
   people used thematic synthesis to develop categories inductively from
   the themes identified in the studies. The synthesis included 44 studies
   from 16 countries: 31 interviewed the youth, 7 their parents, and 6 the
   healthcare professionals. The results are organised around three
   superordinate themes: the individual experience, that is, the individual
   burden and suffering related to suicide attempts in all three groups;
   the relational experience, which describes the importance of
   relationships with others at all stages of the process of suicidal
   behaviour; and the social and cultural experience, or how the group and
   society accept or reject young people in distress and their families and
   how that affects the suicidal process and its management.
   Conclusion
   The violence of the message of a suicidal act and the fears associated
   with death lead to incomprehension and interfere with the capacity for
   empathy of both family members and professionals. The issue in treatment
   is to be able to witness this violence so that the patient feels
   understood and heard, and thus to limit recurrences.}},

Abstract = {{Patient-centered care is an important goal in the delivery of
   healthcare. However, many patients do not engage in preventive medical
   care. In this pilot study, we conducted twenty in depth, semi-structured
   qualitative interviews at the University of Illinois at Chicago Health
   Sciences campus in a four month time frame. Many patients were
   underserved and underinsured, and we wanted to understand their
   experiences in the healthcare system. Using content analysis, several
   themes emerged from the interview data. Participants discussed the need
   for empathy and rapport with their providers. They identified provider
   behaviors that fostered a positive clinical relationship, including
   step-by step explanations of procedures, attention to body language and
   clinic atmosphere, and appropriate time management. Participants
   identified cost as the most common barrier to engaging in preventive
   care and discussed children and social support as motivating factors. A
   long-term relationship with a provider was an important motivator for
   preventive care, suggesting that the therapeutic alliance was essential
   to many patients. Conversely, many participants discussed a sense of
   dehumanization in the healthcare system, reporting that their life
   circumstances were overlooked, or that they were judged based on
   insurance status or ethnicity. We discuss implications for provider
   training and healthcare delivery, including the importance of

Abstract = {{Background: Quality communication skills and increased multicultural
   sensitivity are universal goals, yet teaching them have remained a
   challenge for educators.
   Objective: To document the process and participant responses to
   Interactive Theater when used as a method to teach physician-patient
   communication and cross-cultural competency.
   Design, setting, and participants: Three projects are reported. They
   were collaborations between Theater Delta, the UNC Center for Functional
   GI and Motility Disorders, the Rome Foundation, the World
   Gastroenterology Organization, and the American Gastroenterological
   Association.
   Outcome measures: 8 forced choice and 6 open ended were collected from
   each participant using a post-performance evaluation form.
   Results: Responses to the 8 indicators relating to a positive experience
   participating in the Interactive Theater. The vast majority either
   agreed or strongly agreed with the statements on the evaluation form.
   Written comments explained why.
   Conclusions: Data indicates that Interactive Theater stimulates
   constructive dialogue, analysis, solutions, and intended behavior change
   with regard to communication skills and adapting to patients from
   multicultural backgrounds. Interactive Theater directly focuses on
   communication itself (active listening, empathy, recognizing cultural
   differences, etc.) and shows promise as an effective way to improve
   awareness and skills around these issues.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fewer medical students are choosing to work
   in primary care, and it is difficult to recruit and retain physicians to
   work in underserved communities. Positive exposures with underserved
   communities are known to increase a physician's likelihood of practicing
   in an underserved area. While a number of medical school programs are
   designed to address the rural physician workforce shortage, there are
   fewer medical school programs designed to specifically recruit and
   retain physicians to work in urban underserved areas. This article
   describes a multifaceted, longitudinal medical school curriculum at
   Jefferson Medical College known as the Urban Underserved Program (UUP)
   and a survey administered to UUP graduates exploring the association
   between program participation and practice outcomes.
   METHODS: A mixed methods analysis of an online survey was administered
   to UUP graduates.
   RESULTS: Results indicated that 75\% of UUP graduates work in urban
   areas, 75\% in an underserved or physician shortage area, and 61\% in a
   primary care capacity. Additionally, results indicate that the UUP
   supports and encourages medical students to work with urban underserved
   populations by increasing knowledge of health disparities and empathy
   for underserved populations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Urban underserved communities have greater health
   disparities and less access to health care, and programs that promote
   and prepare students to enter practice in these communities can
   potentially impact the health of these populations.}},

Title = {{Do Contact and Empathy Mitigate Bias Against Gay and Lesbian People
   Among Heterosexual First-Year Medical Students? A Report From the
   Medical Student CHANGE Study}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},

Pages = {{645-651}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   A recent Institute of Medicine report concluded that lesbian and gay
   individuals face discrimination from health care providers and called
   for research on provider attitudes. Medical school is a critical
   juncture for improving future providers' treatment of sexual minorities.
   This study examined both explicit bias and implicit bias against lesbian
   women and gay men among first-year medical students, focusing on two
   predictors of such bias, contact and empathy.
   Method
   This study included the 4,441 heterosexual first-year medical students
   who participated in the baseline survey of the Medical Student Cognitive
   Habits and Growth Evaluation Study, which employed a stratified random
   sample of 49 U.S. medical schools in fall 2010. The researchers measured
   explicit attitudes toward gay and lesbian people using feeling
   thermometer self-assessments, implicit attitudes using the Implicit
   Association Test, amount and favorability of contact using self-report
   items, and empathy using subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index.
   Results
   Nearly half (45.79\%; 956/2,088) of respondents with complete data on
   both bias measures expressed at least some explicit bias, and most
   (81.51\%; 1,702/2,088) exhibited at least some implicit bias against gay
   and lesbian individuals. Both amount and favorability of contact
   predicted positive implicit and explicit attitudes. Both cognitive and
   emotional empathy predicted positive explicit attitudes, but not
   implicit attitudes.
   Conclusions
   The prevalence of negative attitudes presents an important challenge for
   medical education, highlighting the need for more research on possible
   causes of bias. Findings on contact and empathy point to possible
   curriculum-based interventions aimed at ensuring high-quality care for
   sexual minorities.}},

Journal = {{TRIALS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Low-income, Mexican-American patients with diabetes exhibit
   high rates of medication nonadherence, poor blood sugar control and
   serious complications, and often have difficulty communicating their
   concerns about the medication regimen to physicians. Interventions led
   by community health workers, non-professional community members who are
   trained to work with patients to improve engagement and communication
   during the medical visit, have had mixed success in improving outcomes.
   The primary objective of this project is to pilot test a prototype
   software toolkit called ``EMPATHy{''} that a community health worker can
   administer to help patients identify the most important barriers to
   adherence that they face and discuss these barriers with their doctor.
   Methods/Design: The EMPATHy toolkit will be piloted in an ongoing
   intervention (Coached Care) in which community health workers are
   trained to be ``coaches{''} to meet with patients before the medical
   visit and help them prepare a list of important questions for the
   doctor. A total of 190 Mexican-American patients with poorly controlled
   type 2 diabetes will be recruited from December 2014 through June 2015
   and will be randomly assigned to complete either a single Coached Care
   intervention visit with no software tools or a Coached Care visit
   incorporating the EMPATHy software toolkit. The primary endpoints are
   (1) the development of a ``contextualized plan of care{''} (i.e., a plan
   of care that addresses a barrier to medication adherence in the
   patient's daily life) with the doctor, determined from an audio
   recording of the medical visit, and (2) attainment of a concrete
   behavioral goal set during the intervention session, assessed in a
   2-week follow-up phone call to the patient. The statistical analysis
   will include logistic regression models and is powered to detect a 50\%
   increase in the primary endpoints.
   Discussion: The study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness
   and feasibility of a software tool to help patients communicate with
   doctors about problems they face with their medications.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient empowerment is crucial in the successful
   self-management of people with chronic diseases. In this study, we
   investigated whether discussions about medicine use taking place on
   online message boards contribute to patient empowerment and could
   subsequently result in the more effective use of medicines. We discuss
   the extent to which patient empowerment processes occur in discussions
   on online message boards, focusing on patients with three disorders with
   different characteristics: diabetes, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
   and Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Because
   information is an important factor in both patient empowerment and
   self-management, we also evaluate the quality of the information being
   exchanged.
   Methods: We used a deductive thematic analysis method based on
   pre-existing categories. We gathered and analysed 5532 posts related to
   the conditions ADHD, ALS and diabetes from seven message boards (three
   for ADHD, three for diabetes, and one for ALS). We coded the posts for
   empowerment processes and the quality of the information exchanged.
   Results: We identified patient empowerment processes in posts related to
   all three disorders. There is some variation in the frequency of these
   processes, but they show a similar order in the results: patients used
   the online message boards to exchange information, share personal
   experiences and for empathy or support. The type of information shared
   in these processes could contribute to the patient's self-efficacy when
   it comes to medicine use. The exchanged information was either correct
   or largely harmless. We also observed a tendency whereby participants
   correct previously posted incorrect information, and refer people to a
   healthcare professional following a request for medical advice, e.g.
   concerning the choice of medicines or dosage.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that patient empowerment processes occur
   in posts related to all three disorders. The type of information shared
   in these processes can contribute to the patient's self-efficacy when it
   comes to medicine use. The tendency to refer people to a healthcare
   professional shows that patients still reserve an important role for
   healthcare professionals in the care process, despite the development
   towards more self-management.}},

   of Medical Sciences (277 individuals), who were selected by convenience
   sampling. The participation rate was 97.47\% (270 individuals). A
   questionnaire including demographic information and professional
   experience was used to gather information (included 12 questions).
   Additionally, the Jefferson Scale of Attitudes toward Physician-Nurse
   Collaboration (JSAPNC) was also used (included 15 questions). Data were
   analyzed using the SPSS software. The applied statistical tests
   included:chi(2), t student and ANOVA test.
   Results: The obtained mean attitude score for the first academic year
   (51.28 +/- 4.98) was higher than the mean attitude score of the fourth
   academic year nursing students (50.56 +/- 4.05). However, the results of
   the independent statistical t-test showed no significant difference
   between the two groups of students (P = 0.322). In the four dimensions
   of JSAPNC, concerning only the dimension of physician authority, there
   were significant differences between the two groups of students (P <
   0.05). The obtained means for the first and fourth academic year of
   bachelor nursing students reflected their positive attitudes about
   collaboration between physicians and nurses.
   Conclusions: The positive attitude of most nursing students found in
   this study showed the need for appropriate and effective collaboration
   between medical staff; this collaboration will give patients and
   prospective patients the best possible care.}},

Abstract = {{Problem
   Although only some medical students pursue a career in oncology, all
   should have a basic understanding of the issues surrounding cancer and
   its treatment. The authors designed and implemented a one-week
   introductory clinical oncology course for second-year medical students
   at Ben Gurion University of the Negev. The course presents a holistic
   approach to caring for patients with cancer that goes beyond the
   biological aspects of the disease.
   Approach
   In 2013, the authors interviewed four former students and surveyed all
   current students before and after they completed the course to evaluate
   its reception and effectiveness.
   Outcomes
   Of the 86 students in the course, 77 (90\%) completed both the pre- and
   postcourse surveys. After taking the course, more students reported
   being concerned about ethical issues, being emotionally stirred by the
   course, being comfortable speaking with a cancer patient about death and
   dying, and being comfortable with the fact that the course dealt with
   issues of death and loss and with `` how to live with cancer.{''} In
   addition, more students reported a fear of causing a cancer patient
   suffering because of a treatment yet viewed cancer optimistically.
   Finally, more students considered specializing in oncology.
   Next Steps
   That students reported increased empathy toward cancer patients despite
   increased trepidation about causing them suffering is promising. Such
   courses may be one way to counteract the decrease in empathy among
   students as they progress through medical school. As such, medical
   schools might consider including this type of curriculum in their
   preclinical oncology studies.}},

Title = {{Can Empathy, Other Personality Attributes, and Level of Positive Social
   Influence in Medical School Identify Potential Leaders in Medicine?}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{505-510}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To test the hypotheses that medical students recognized by peers as the
   most positive social influencers would score (1) high on measures of
   engaging personality attributes that are conducive to relationship
   building (empathy, sociability, activity, self-esteem), and (2) low on
   disengaging personality attributes that are detrimental to interpersonal
   relationships (loneliness, neuroticism, aggression-hostility, impulsive
   sensation seeking).
   Method
   The study included 666 Jefferson Medical College students who graduated
   in 2011-2013. Students used a peer nomination instrument to identify
   classmates who had a positive influence on their professional and
   personal development. At matriculation, these students had completed a
   survey that included the Jefferson Scale of Empathy and
   Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire short form and abridged
   versions of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale.
   In multivariate analyses of variance, the method of contrasted groups
   was used to compare the personality attributes of students nominated
   most frequently by their peers as positive influencers (top influencers
   {[}top 25\% in their class distribution], n = 176) with those of
   students nominated least frequently (bottom influencers {[}bottom 25\%],
   n = 171).
   Results
   The top influencers scored significantly higher on empathy, sociability,
   and activity and significantly lower on loneliness compared with the
   bottom influencers. However, the effect size estimates of the
   differences were moderate at best.
   Conclusions
   The research hypotheses were partially confirmed. Positive social
   influencers appear to possess personality attributes conducive to
   relationship building, which is an important feature of effective
   leadership. The findings have implications for identifying and training
   potential leaders in medicine.}},

Abstract = {{A common phenomenon among cancer patients is a fear of cancer recurrence
   or cancer progression (FOP). The aim of the present study was to analyze
   whether the oncologist is able to reduce patients' FOP at the initial
   clinical interview.
   A prospective, longitudinal study included patients who were consulting
   private-practice oncologists in Germany for the first time. Recruitment
   was carried out by 44 members of the Professional Organization of
   Office-Based Hematologists and Oncologists. In the patient surveys, data
   on colon cancer patients' perceptions of communications with their
   oncologist and on patient-reported outcomes were collected over a period
   of 6 months. The present study analyzed the patients' data before their
   first consultation (T (0)) and within 3 days after the first
   consultation (T (1)).
   A total of 169 patients agreed to participate in the study. Backwards
   multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine whether the
   change (T (0)-T (1)) in FOP is associated with demographic, medical, or
   psychosocial determinants, or with the physician-patient communication.
   A significant association was found between the change in FOP and
   interruptions to the conversation, the comprehensibility of the
   information provided, the extent of perceived empathy from the
   physician, and the patient's social support and family status.
   Private social support and the initial medical encounter can help reduce
   FOP. Particularly, oncologists should ensure that they facilitate the
   presentation of information in a comprehensible way while avoiding
   interruptions and that they take particular care of patients with poor
   social support.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL ETHICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conscientious objection (CO) to participating in induced
   abortion is not present in the Finnish health care system or legislation
   unlike in many other European countries.
   Methods: We conducted a questionnaire survey with the 1st- and the
   last-year medical and nursing students and professionals (548
   respondents; response rate 66-100\%) including several aspects of the
   abortion process and their relation to CO in 2013.
   Results: The male medical respondents chose later time points of
   pregnancy than the nursing respondents when considering when the
   embryo/fetus ``becomes a person{''}. Of all respondents, 3.5-14.1\%
   expressed a personal wish to CO. The medical professionals supported the
   right to CO more often (34.2\%) than the nursing professionals (21.4\%),
   while >= 62.4\% could work with someone expressing CO. Yet >= 57.9\% of
   the respondents anticipated social problems at work communities caused
   by CO. Most respondents considered self-reported religious/ethical
   conviction to be adequate for CO but, at the same time, 30.1-50.7\%
   considered that no conviction would be sufficient. The respondents most
   commonly included the medical doctor conducting surgical or medical
   abortion to be eligible to CO. The nursing respondents considered that
   vacuum suction would be a better justification for CO than medical
   abortion. The indications most commonly included to potential CO were
   second-trimester abortions and social reasons. Among the medical
   respondents, the men were more willing to grant CO also in case of a
   life-threatening emergency of the pregnant woman.
   Conclusions: While the respondents mostly seemed to consider the
   continuation of adequate services important if CO is introduced, the
   viewpoint was often focused on the staff and surgical abortion procedure
   instead of the patients. The issue proved to be complex, which should be
   taken into consideration for legislation.}},

Journal = {{WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{138-144}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The past decade has seen an increasing focus on
   professionalism within the medical school curriculum. This reflects the
   growing demand for doctors who demonstrate empathy and uphold the
   altruistic values of the Hippocratic Oath. Such is often challenged by
   the resource-constrained environments of developing nations requiring
   uniquely tailored interventions within these regions.
   Purpose: As part of a wider effort to develop training of medical
   professionalism at our institution, an initiative was pursued to assess
   the current knowledge about and attitudes toward medical
   professionalism.
   Methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional descriptive study
   of fourth and fifth year medical students and junior doctors. A
   questionnaire was adapted and revised from a previously published study.
   Questions were grouped into categories pertaining to knowledge about
   professionalism and attitudes toward professionalism. Overall, 191
   questionnaires were analysed (168 students and 23 doctors).
   Results: Junior doctors'scores were higher than medical students for all
   knowledge subscales but scores on the attitude subscales were
   significantly lower than medical students. Overall, in both groups,
   attitude scores were higher than knowledge scores. There was an overall
   trend of decreasing attitude scores as persons progressed through their
   training years and into clinical practice.
   Conclusions: Results demonstrate limited knowledge about medical
   professionalism but good attitudes toward this trait. Taken together,
   this perhaps highlights a receptivity toward more formal training within
   this area that is also justified by the marked decline in attitude
   scores over time.}},

Pages = {{79-84}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: This study aimed to examine the impact of housemanship and
   cohort effect on the perceptions of what constitutes a ``role model
   physician{''} between 2 cohorts of medical students. Materials \&
   Methods: Final year medical students of the Yong Loo Lin School of
   Medicine, National University of Singapore, from the classes of 2005
   (pre- and post-housemanship) and class of 2009 (pre-housemanship)
   responded to an anonymous 25-statement questionnaire reflecting Fones et
   al's 25-item characterisation of a ``role model{''} doctor. Qualitative
   data was also collected on student's perceived qualities of a role model
   doctor. Results: For the 2005 cohort pre- and post-housemanship, only 3
   of the 25 items had increased in importance post-housemanship. However,
   when comparing the 2005 and 2009 cohorts pre-housemanship, the latter
   cohort placed significantly greater importance on 12 of the 25 items.
   Willingness to teach was identified via qualitative analysis as a new
   important quality of a role model doctor for medical students.
   Conclusion: The importance placed on characteristics of ``role model{''}
   physicians were relatively unchanged by housemanship within the same
   cohort but increased with time between 2 cohorts 5 years apart. This
   suggests that professional standards of an ``ideal{''} doctor expected
   and aspired to by medical students may not be eroding as feared by the
   medical profession and society.}},

Abstract = {{A new interprofessional geriatric medicine curriculum was recently
   introduced at a large undergraduate Asian medical school. A longitudinal
   controlled interventional cohort study was conducted to evaluate the
   effect of the new curriculum on the knowledge and attitudes of medical
   students. The medical students under the new curriculum formed the
   intervention cohort, and those under the former curriculum formed the
   control cohort. To test knowledge, the University of California at Los
   Angeles (UCLA) geriatrics knowledge test (GKT) was used in Year 2 and
   the University of Michigan GKT in Year 5. Geriatrics attitudes were
   evaluated using the UCLA geriatrics attitudes test in Years 2 and 5. Not
   surprisingly, geriatrics knowledge at the end of Year 5 of medical
   school was enhanced to a greater degree in the intervention cohort than
   the control cohort, although improvements in geriatrics attitudes in
   each cohort were of similar magnitude by the end of Year 5, suggesting
   that factors other than a formal geriatrics curriculum influenced the
   improvements in geriatrics attitudes. This article is one of few
   published on the effectiveness of geriatrics curricular innovations
   using validated knowledge and attitude outcomes in a longitudinal
   controlled study design and will be useful to other medical institutions
   seeking to improve the geriatrics knowledge and attitudes of their
   students.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We share qualitative study results of
   third-year medical student writings during their family medicine
   clerkship utilizing a reflective writing exercise from 2005 and 2013.
   METHODS: For this paper, 50 student writings were randomly selected from

   cohort. Deductive thematic analysis utilizing Atlas.ti software was
   completed utilizing the Future of Family Medicine core attributes of
   family physicians as the a priori coding template.
   RESULTS: Student writings actively reflect key attributes of family
   physicians as described by the Future of Family Medicine Report: a deep
   understanding of the dynamics of the whole person, a generative impact
   on patients' lives, a talent for humanizing the health care experience,
   and a natural command of complexity and multidimensional access to care.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Physician workforce projections fuel interest
   in addressing the shortage of family physicians. Copious research has
   investigated personality as a variable influencing specialty intention.
   Medical school rural longitudinal integrated clerkships (LICs) nurture
   interest in family medicine. This study examined whether rural LIC
   students who intended to and eventually matched into family medicine
   portrayed a personality trait profile different from rural LIC students
   who intended or matched to all other specialities. The profiles of four
   successive cohorts are described in relation to their intended and
   eventual specialty match.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional design sampled 145 third-year students from
   2008-2011. A survey measured demographics, temperament and character
   personality traits, and Other-Oriented Empathy. Multivariate analysis
   compared family medicine versus all other specialty matches and original
   specialty intention with eventual match.
   RESULTS: Match groups did not differ in gender, age, or marital status.
   Rural LIC students who matched in family medicine had lower levels of
   Harm Avoidance, higher Reward Dependence, and nonsignificant higher
   levels of every other personality trait in comparison to other matches.
   Rural LIC students who intended and matched to family medicine showed
   the highest levels of Reward Dependence (warm sociability) and
   Other-Oriented Empathy compared to any other specialty.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of Harm Avoidance are conducive to less
   anxiety, more composure and confidence in making decisions, and being
   relaxed in accepting a degree of risk and uncertainty. Such calm
   optimism along with higher Reward Dependence showing social warmth and
   empathy are desirable traits for family physicians regularly confronted
   with a wide range of presentations from the obvious to complex. Further
   investigation of what influences sustainability of the intention to
   enter family medicine may be useful to educators for counseling.}},

Abstract = {{The authors describe how they came to the realization that theater arts
   techniques can be useful and effective tools for teaching interpersonal
   communication skills (ICS) in medical education. After recognizing the
   outstanding interpersonal skills demonstrated by two
   actors-turned-doctors, in 2010 the authors began to develop a technique
   called Facilitated Simulation Education and Evaluation (FSEE) to teach
   ICS. In FSEE, actors and residents are coached in empathic, and
   therefore effective, ICS using a novel technique based on lessons
   learned from theater arts education. Competence in ICS includes the
   ability to listen actively, observe acutely, and communicate clearly and
   compassionately, with the ultimate goal of improving medical outcomes.
   Resident, actor, and faculty perceptions after two years of experience
   with FSEE have been positive. After describing the FSEE approach, the
   authors suggest next steps for studying and expanding the role of
   theater arts in ICS training.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To educate physicians who are capable of delivering ethical, socially
   responsible, patient-centered care, there have been calls for
   identifying curricular space for reflection on the human and societal
   dimensions of medicine. These appeals, however, beg the question: What
   does it mean to devote space in an otherwise busy curriculum for these
   types of reflection? This Perspective is an attempt to understand the
   nature of this educational space in terms of its purpose, uses,
   dynamics, and limitations, and the underlying components that allow
   reflection and transformation to occur. Reflections on psychosocial
   themes often take the form of dialogues, which differ from the
   discussions commonly encountered in clinical settings because they
   require the engagement of the participants' whole selveslife
   experiences, backgrounds, personal values, beliefs, and perspectivesin
   the exchanges. Dialogues allow for the inclusion of affective and
   experiential dimensions in addition to intellectual/cognitive domains in
   learning, and for an emphasis on discovering new perspectives, insights,
   and questions instead of limiting participants solely to an instrumental
   search for solutions. Although these reflections may vary greatly in
   their form and settings, the reflective space requires three qualities:
   safety and confidentiality, an intentional designation of a time apart
   from the distractions of daily life for reflection and dialogue, and an
   awareness of the transitional naturethe liminalityof a critically
   important period of professional identity development. In this open
   space of reflection and dialogue, one's identity as a humanistic
   physician takes form.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Slow medical education borrows from other slow movements by offering a
   complementary orientation to medical education that emphasizes the value
   of slow and thoughtful reflection and interaction in medical education
   and clinical care. Such slow experiences, when systematically structured
   throughout the curriculum, offer ways for learners to engage in
   thoughtful reflection, dialogue, appreciation, and human understanding,
   with the hope that they will incorporate these practices throughout
   their lives as physicians. This Perspective offers several spaces in the
   medical curriculum where slowing down is possible: while reading and
   writing at various times in the curriculum and while providing clinical
   care, focusing particularly on conducting the physical exam and other
   dimensions of patient care. Time taken to slow down in these ways offers
   emerging physicians opportunities to more fully incorporate their
   experiences into a professional identity that embodies reflection,
   critical awareness, cultural humility, and empathy. The authors argue
   that these curricular spaces must be created in a very deliberate
   manner, even on busy ward services, throughout the education of

   a major role in the declining empathy experienced by medical students

   reporting unprofessional behavior within medical schools including fear
   of retaliation and lack of mechanisms to ensure anonymity. Second, deans
   and directors do not want to look for unethical behavior in their
   colleagues. Third, most of us have learned to take disrespectful
   circumstances in health care institutions for granted. Fourth, the
   accreditation of medical schools around the world does not usually cover
   the processes or outcomes associated with fostering ethical behavior in
   students. Several initiatives promise to change that picture.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the emotional responses to patient care
   activities described by fourth year medical students.
   Methods: Qualitative content analysis for emerging themes in letters
   written by graduating medical students to patients during a Capstone
   Course. The patient need not be alive and the letter would never be
   sent.
   Results: Six themes emerged from student letters: (1) Sorrow for the
   depths of patient suffering; (2) Gratitude towards patients and their
   families; (3) Personal responsibility for care provided to patients; (4)
   Regret for poor care provided by the student or student's team; (5)
   Shattered expectations about medicine and training; and (6) Anger
   towards patients. Students expressed sensitivity to vulnerable patients,
   including those who were alone, unable to communicate, or for whom care
   was biased. Students' expressed powerlessness (inability to cure,
   managing a work-life balance, and challenges with hierarchy) in some
   essays.
   Conclusion: At graduation, medical students describe strong emotions
   about previous patient care experiences, including difficulty witnessing
   suffering, disappointment with medicine, and gratitude to patients and
   their families
   Practice implications: Providing regular opportunities for writing
   throughout medical education would allow students to recognize their
   emotions, reflect upon them and promote wellness that would benefit
   students and their patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Empathy is desirable in all health care professionals in their
   interactions with patients and each other. Empathy in its cognitive
   (perspective-taking) and affective forms has been well-studied in the
   literature and in fact, is shown in most studies to decline during
   undergraduate and graduate medical education. Empathy has also been
   shown to be inversely proportional to one's sense of power (SOP) in the
   business literature. In addition, the relationship of empathy to
   personality traits has not been examined. This cross-sectional study of
   four cohorts of undergraduate medical students at a private mid-Atlantic
   medical school compares the empathy of first, second, third and fourth
   year medical students to see if there is a decline across the medical
   school experience. It also examines the relationship among empathy, SOP
   and personality type across the 4 years of medical school. Unlike in
   many previous studies, we found no decline in student empathy. We found
   no significant relationship between SOP and empathy. Finally, there were
   no significant differences in power perception and personality measures
   across all educational years surveyed.}},

Title = {{Patient exposure in the basic science classroom enhances differential
   diagnosis formation and clinical decision-making}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. The authors proposed that introducing real patients into a
   pathology classroom early in medical education would help integrate
   fundamental principles and disease pathology with clinical presentation
   and medical history.
   Methods. Three patients with different pathologies described their
   history and presentation without revealing their diagnosis. Students
   were required to submit a differential diagnosis in writing, and then
   were able to ask questions to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Students
   were surveyed on the efficacy of patient-based learning.
   Results. Average student scores on the differential diagnosis
   assignments significantly improved 32\% during the course. From the
   survey, 72\% of students felt that patient encounters should be included
   in the pathology course next year. Seventy-four percent felt that the
   differential diagnosis assignments helped them develop clinical
   decision-making skills. Seventy-three percent felt that the experience
   helped them know what questions to ask patients. Eighty-six percent felt
   that they obtained a better understanding of patients' social and
   emotional challenges.
   Discussion. Having students work through the process of differential
   diagnosis formulation when encountering a real patient and their
   clinical presentation improved clinical decision-making skills and
   integrated fundamental concepts with disease pathology during a basic
   science pathology course.}},

Title = {{Role modelling of clinical tutors: a focus group study among medical
   students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Role modelling by clinicians assists in development of
   medical students' professional competencies, values and attitudes. Three
   core characteristics of a positive role model include 1) clinical
   attributes, 2) teaching skills, and 3) personal qualities. This study
   was designed to explore medical students' perceptions of their bedside
   clinical tutors as role models during the first year of a medical
   program.
   Methods: The study was conducted with one cohort (n = 301) of students
   who had completed Year 1 of the Sydney Medical Program in 2013. A total
   of nine focus groups (n = 59) were conducted with medical students
   following completion of Year 1. Data were transcribed verbatim. Thematic
   analysis was used to code and categorise data into themes.
   Results: Students identified both positive and negative characteristics
   and behaviour displayed by their clinical tutors. Characteristics and
   behaviour that students would like to emulate as medical practitioners
   in the future included: 1) Clinical attributes: a good knowledge base;
   articulate history taking skills; the ability to explain and demonstrate
   skills at the appropriate level for students; and empathy, respect and
   genuine compassion for patients. 2) Teaching skills: development of a
   rapport with students; provision of time towards the growth of students
   academically and professionally; provision of a positive learning
   environment; an understanding of the student curriculum and assessment
   requirements; immediate and useful feedback; and provision of patient
   interaction. 3) Personal qualities: respectful interprofessional staff
   interactions; preparedness for tutorials; demonstration of a passion for
   teaching; and demonstration of a passion for their career choice.
   Conclusion: Excellence in role modelling entails demonstration of
   excellent clinical care, teaching skills and personal characteristics.
   Our findings reinforce the important function of clinical bedside tutors
   as role models, which has implications for faculty development and
   recruitment.}},

Title = {{Empathy: what does it mean for GPs? A qualitative study}},
Journal = {{FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Research has highlighted empathy as an important and
   effective factor in patient-physician communication. GPs have extensive
   practical experience with empathy. However, little is known about the
   personal views of GPs regarding the meaning and application of empathy
   in daily practice.
   Objectives. To explore GP's experiences and the application of empathy
   in daily practice and to investigate the practical use of empathy. Facts
   such as preconditions, barriers and facilitating possibilities are
   described.
   Methods. Qualitative interview study; 30 in-depth interviews were
   performed between June 2012 and January 2013 with a heterogeneous sample
   of Dutch GPs. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim; content
   analysis was performed with the help of ATLAS-ti.
   Results. Empathy was seen as an important quality-increasing element
   during the patient-GP consultation. The application of non-verbal and
   verbal techniques was described. Attention to cues and references to
   previous consults were reported separately. Required preconditions were:
   being physically and mentally fit, feeling no time pressure and having
   an efficient practice organization. Not feeling connected to the patient
   and strict medical guidelines and protocols were identified as
   obstacles. A key consideration was the positive contribution of empathy
   to job satisfaction.
   Conclusions. The opinions of GPs in this research can be considered as
   supplementing and strengthening the findings of previous researches. The
   GPs in this study discussed, in particular, ideas important to the
   facilitation of empathy. These included: longer consultations, smaller
   practices, efficient telephonic triage by practice assistants, using
   intervision to help reflect on their work and drawing financiers'
   attention to the effectiveness of empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper describes an evaluation of an innovative approach,
   role-play based learning (RBL), as a vehicle for teaching psychiatry.
   The aim of this intervention, where medical students perform both doctor
   and patients roles, was to provide an interactive learning format that
   engaged students while developing clinical knowledge and communication
   skills in a structured, reflective environment.
   Method: Questionnaires were completed by 107 students from three
   clinical schools of the University of Melbourne. Data were analysed
   using descriptive and inferential statistics and thematic content
   analysis.
   Results: Student evaluations of the RBL sessions were overwhelmingly
   positive. Respondents reported improvements in engagement, confidence
   and empathy, as well as in their learning, and that the sessions
   provided good preparation for internship as well as for exams.
   Conclusion: The RBL tutorial programme is unique and flexible and could
   readily be adapted for use in other specialty rotations. It is also
   timely, given the increased interest in simulation prompted by
   increasing pressure on training places across the health sciences in
   Australia.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{174-185}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{ContextThere is little room in clerkship curricula for students to
   express emotions, particularly those associated with the development of
   a caring identity. Yet it is recognised that competence, alone, does not
   make a good doctor. We therefore set out to explore the relationship
   between emotions and identity in clerkship education. Our exploration
   was conceptually oriented towards Figured Worlds theory, which is linked
   to Bakhtin's theory of dialogism.
   MethodsNine female and one male member of a mixed student cohort kept
   audio-diaries and participated in both semi-structured and cognitive
   individual interviews. The researchers identified 43 emotionally salient
   utterances in the dataset and subjected them to critical discourse
   analysis. They applied Figured Worlds constructs to within-case and
   cross-case analyses, supporting one another's reflexivity and openness
   to different interpretations, and constantly comparing their evolving
   interpretation against the complete set of transcripts.
   ResultsStudents' emotions were closely related to their identity
   development in the world of medicine. Patients were disempowered by
   their illnesses. Doctors were powerful because they could treat those
   illnesses. Students expressed positive emotions when they were granted
   positions in the world of medicine and were able to identify with the
   figures of doctors or other health professionals. They identified with
   doctors who behaved in caring and professionally appropriate ways
   towards patients and supportively towards students. Students expressed
   negative emotions when they were unable to develop their identities.
   ConclusionsCritical discourse analysis has uncovered a link between
   students' emotions and their identity development in the powerful world
   of becoming and being a doctor. At present, identity development,
   emotions and power are mostly tacit in undergraduate clinical curricula.
   We speculate that helping students to express emotions and exercise
   power in the most effective ways might help them to develop caring
   identities.

Abstract = {{Empathy may be defined as the ability to share and/or understand others'
   emotional state. It is a multi-faceted construct that relies on discrete
   psychological processes with specific neural correlates. These
   psychological processes might be impaired in some mental disorders, such
   as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, borderline personality
   disorder or mood disorders. Among these disorders, psychopathy is mainly
   characterized by a lack of empathy for others' distress associated with
   amygdala hypo-reactivity. In the context of doctor-patient
   relationships, clinical empathy also encompasses the physician's ability
   to communicate his or her understanding of the emotional state of the
   patient. However, sharing the emotional states may elicit compassion
   fatigue and burnout symptoms among physicians and medical students and
   reduce their empathic capacities. A decline of these capacities is
   indeed observed during medical training. Perspective-taking may protect
   physicians from such negative effects while allowing them to show
   sustained empathic concern. Interventions to promote empathy among
   medical students should target both communication skills and humanist
   values: communication skill may depend on humanist values to grow.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{943-948}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies on empathy in Korean medical students were
   conducted on small populations or with different scales of measurement,
   resulting in low representativeness and generalisability of the
   findings.
   Aim: To evaluate empathy in Korean medical students throughout the
   country and to make suggestions to improve empathy.
   Methods: The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) (Korean) was used, and the
   impact of sex, age, the medical school admission system, and grade of
   the respondents was investigated.
   Results: We analyzed 5343 questionnaires and found a mean empathy score
   of 105.9 +/- 12.8. Females and post-baccalaureate students had higher
   scores as compared with their counterparts. There was a significant
   difference between the admission systems after controlling for gender.
   Students from higher grade levels had lower scores than those from the
   lower grade levels.
   Conclusions: The JSE score of Korean medical students was lower than
   that of students in Western countries. The difference of gender and
   medical school admission system should be considered, and capability to
   apply empathy to clinical practice should be focused upon in medical
   training.}},

Title = {{Professionalism dilemmas, moral distress and the healthcare student:
   insights from two online UK-wide questionnaire studies}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To understand the prevalence of healthcare students'
   witnessing or participating in something that they think unethical
   (professionalism dilemmas) during workplace learning and examine whether
   differences exist in moral distress intensity resulting from these
   experiences according to gender and the frequency of occurrence.
   Design: Two cross-sectional online questionnaires of UK medical (study
   1) and nursing, dentistry, physiotherapy and pharmacy students (study 2)
   concerning professionalism dilemmas and subsequent distress for (1)
   Patient dignity and safety breaches; (2) Valid consent for students'
   learning on patients; and (3) Negative workplace behaviours (eg, student
   abuse).
   Participants and setting: 2397 medical (67.4\% female) and 1399 other
   healthcare students (81.1\% female) responded.
   Main results: The most commonly encountered professionalism dilemmas
   were: student abuse and patient dignity and safety dilemmas. Multinomial
   and logistic regression identified significant effects for gender and
   frequency of occurrence. In both studies, men were more likely to
   classify themselves as experiencing no distress; women were more likely
   to classify themselves as distressed. Two distinct patterns concerning
   frequency were apparent: (1) Habituation (study 1): less distress with
   increased exposure to dilemmas `justified' for learning; (2) Disturbance
   (studies 1 and 2): more distress with increased exposure to dilemmas
   that could not be justified.
   Conclusions: Tomorrow's healthcare practitioners learn within a
   workplace in which they frequently encounter dilemmas resulting in
   distress. Gender differences could be respondents acting according to
   gendered expectations (eg, males downplaying distress because they are
   expected to appear tough). Habituation to dilemmas suggests students
   might balance patient autonomy and right to dignity with their own needs
   to learn for future patient benefit. Disturbance contests the `accepted'
   notion that students become less empathic over time. Future research
   might examine the strategies that students use to manage their distress,
   to understand how this impacts of issues such as burnout and/or leaving
   the profession.}},

Title = {{Predictors of professional behaviour and academic outcomes in a UK
   medical school: A longitudinal cohort study}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{868-880}},
Abstract = {{Background: Over the past 70 years, there has been a recurring debate in
   the literature and in the popular press about how best to select medical
   students. This implies that we are still not getting it right: either
   some students are unsuited to medicine or the graduating doctors are
   considered unsatisfactory, or both.
   Aim: To determine whether particular variables at the point of selection
   might distinguish those more likely to become satisfactory professional
   doctors, by following a complete intake cohort of students throughout
   medical school and analysing all the data used for the students'
   selection, their performance on a range of other potential selection
   tests, academic and clinical assessments throughout their studies, and
   records of professional behaviour covering the entire five years of the
   course.
   Methods: A longitudinal database captured the following anonymised
   information for every student (n = 146) admitted in 2007 to the Hull
   York Medical School (HYMS) in the UK: demographic data (age, sex,
   citizenship); performance in each component of the selection procedure;
   performance in some other possible selection instruments (cognitive and
   non-cognitive psychometric tests); professional behaviour in tutorials
   and in other clinical settings; academic performance, clinical and
   communication skills at summative assessments throughout; professional
   behaviour lapses monitored routinely as part of the fitness-to-practise
   procedures. Correlations were sought between predictor variables and
   criterion variables chosen to demonstrate the full range of course
   outcomes from failure to complete the course to graduation with honours,
   and to reveal clinical and professional strengths and weaknesses.
   Results: Student demography was found to be an important predictor of
   outcomes, with females, younger students and British citizens performing
   better overall. The selection variable ``HYMS academic score'', based on
   prior academic performance, was a significant predictor of components of
   Year 4 written and Year 5 clinical examinations. Some cognitive subtest
   scores from the UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT) and the UKCAT total
   score were also significant predictors of the same components, and a
   unique predictor of the Year 5 written examination. A number of the
   non-cognitive tests were significant independent predictors of Years 4
   and 5 clinical performance, and of lapses in professional behaviour.
   First-and second-year tutor ratings were significant predictors of all
   outcomes, both desirable and undesirable. Performance in Years 1 and 2
   written exams did not predict performance in Year 4 but did generally
   predict Year 5 written and clinical performance.
   Conclusions: Measures of a range of relevant selection attributes and
   personal qualities can predict intermediate and end of course
   achievements in academic, clinical and professional behaviour domains.
   In this study HYMS academic score, some UKCAT subtest scores and the
   total UKCAT score, and some non-cognitive tests completed at the outset
   of studies, together predicted outcomes most comprehensively. Tutor
   evaluation of students early in the course also identified the more and
   less successful students in the three domains of academic, clinical and
   professional performance. These results may be helpful in informing the
   future development of selection tools.}},

Title = {{A BEME systematic review of UK undergraduate medical education in the
   general practice setting: BEME Guide No. 32}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{611-630}},
Abstract = {{Background: General practice is increasingly used as a learning
   environment in undergraduate medical education in the UK.
   Aim: The aim of this project was to identify, summarise and synthesise
   research about undergraduate medical education in general practice in
   the UK.
   Methods: We systematically identified studies of undergraduate medical
   education within a general practice setting in the UK from 1990 onwards.
   All papers were summarised in a descriptive report and categorised into
   two in-depth syntheses: a quantitative and a qualitative in-depth
   review.
   Results: 169 papers were identified, representing research from 26 UK
   medical schools. The in-depth review of quantitative papers (n = 7)
   showed that medical students learned clinical skills as well or better
   in general practice settings. Students receive more teaching, and clerk
   and examine more patients in the general practice setting than in
   hospital. Patient satisfaction and enablement are similar whether a
   student is present or not in a consultation, however, patients
   experience lower relational empathy. Two main thematic groups emerged
   from the qualitative in-depth review (n = 10): the interpersonal
   interactions within the teaching consultation and the socio-cultural
   spaces of learning which shape these interactions. The GP has a role as
   a broker of the interactions between patients and students. General
   practice is a socio-cultural and developmental learning space for
   students, who need to negotiate the competing cultures between hospital
   and general practice. Lastly, patients are transient members of the
   learning community, and their role requires careful facilitation.
   Conclusions: General practice is as good, if not better, than hospital
   delivery of teaching of clinical skills. Our meta-ethnography has
   produced rich understandings of the complex relationships shaping
   possibilities for student and patient active participation in learning.}},
