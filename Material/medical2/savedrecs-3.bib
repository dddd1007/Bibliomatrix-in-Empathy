Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: When told the harsh truth about severe disease, a
   patient might despair and lose all hope. Without knowing the truth,
   however, the patient cannot participate in decision making and adjust
   life according to his illness. The present study aims to analyze the
   relationships between hope and truth in the decision on how much
   information to disclose to a patient with severe gastrointestinal
   disease. Methods: The decision analysis is based on the economic
   concepts of indifference curves and utility function. An inverse linear
   relationship exists between hope and truth; as more truth becomes
   revealed, the amount of hope declines. The utility function and the
   corresponding indifference curve of hope plotted versus truth describe
   the patient's personal choices among different combinations of hope and
   truth. The optimal choice among various combinations of hope and truth
   corresponds with the point at which the inverse hope-truth line meets
   the indifference curve. Results: In situations in which hope drops
   steeply as more medical facts are being revealed, the utility to the
   patient is maximized with less truth being told. With a less pronounced
   truth-related decline in hope, utility is maximized at higher levels of
   truth, and, occasionally, utility is maximized only after all medical
   facts have been disclosed. The lesser the impact of truth on hope, the
   more truth is being tolerated. Conclusions: A caring gastroenterologist
   trying to optimize his/her patient's well-being should try to assess the
   potential influence of truth on the patient's psyche and dispense it
   accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Caring for dying persons requires skill in interpersonal aspects of
   care, which may be difficult to teach using conventional educational
   methods. The Pulitzer Prize-winning play Wit relates the personal story
   of a patient dying from metastatic ovarian cancer and describes the
   protagonist's experience with medical care from diagnosis to death.
   Members of the Department of Medicine at the VA Greater Los Angeles
   Health care System and the David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA
   developed a program that utilized Wit to educate medical students,
   residents, and staff providers in the humanistic elements of end-of-life
   care.
   Between February 2000 and January 2002 the Wit Educational Initiative
   organized on-site readings of Wit by local professional theatre
   companies at medical centers throughout the United States and Canada,
   inviting medical students, housestaff, and other providers to attend the
   play followed by structured discussions of the play's themes. The
   Initiative provided extensive support for potential program sites
   including publicity, providing a handbook with a step-by-step guide to
   organizing local programs, and feedback of postperformance survey
   results.
   The Initiative was successful in organizing performances at 32 out of 54
   (59\%) medical centers where a local production of Wit was identified.
   Survey respondents confirmed the appeal, emotional impact, and perceived
   relevance of drama in end-of-life education. An educational program
   using theatre to educate trainees in the humanistic aspects of
   end-of-life care was enthusiastically received by medical schools and
   rated highly by attendees.}},

   formulate their own learning outcomes. Adult learners appreciate
   opportunities to learn from real or simulated experiences that are

   to help students to develop empathy and communication skills and
   patients with chronic skin conditions such as psoriasis can make an
   active contribution to the education of students. Students learning
   dermatology use both pattern- recognition and analytical processes, but
   pattern recognition develops only with repetition and it is not
   realistic to expect students to acquire many diagnostic skills. Instead
   teachers should provide students with a framework that will enable them
   to analyse skin conditions, to understand the relevance of what is
   taught and to apply their learning in the future. All medical graduates
   should be able to describe the skin and record their findings each time
   they clerk a patient.}},

   sessions in the year. In advance, the mentor recorded his model. During
   the year, the mentee kept a process journal.
   Qualitative analysis revealed development of an intimate relationship
   based on empathy, trust, and honesty. The mentor's model was explicitly
   intended to develop independence, initiative, improved thinking, skills,
   and self-reflection. The mentor's methods included extensive and varied
   use of questioning, active listening, standard setting, and frequent
   feedback. During the mentoring, the mentee evolved as a teacher,
   enhanced the creativity in his teaching, and matured as a person.
   Specific accomplishments included a national workshop on professional
   writing, an innovative approach to inpatient attending, a new teaching
   skills curriculum for a residency program, and this study.
   A mentoring model stressing safety, intimacy, honesty, setting of high

Title = {{Personal illness narratives: Using reflective writing to teach empathy}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{351-356}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Reflective writing is one established method for teaching medical
   students empathetic interactions with patients. Most Such exercises rely
   on students' reflecting upon clinical experiences. To effectively
   elicit, interpret, and translate the patient's story, however, a
   reflective practitioner must also be self-aware, personally and
   professionally. Race, gender, and other embodied sources of identity of
   practitioners and patients have been shown to influence the nature of
   clinical communication. Yet, although medical practice is dedicated to
   examining, diagnosing, and treating bodies, the relationship of
   physicians to their own physicality is vexed. Medical training creates a
   dichotomy whereby patients are identified by their bodies while
   physicians' bodies are secondary to physicians' minds. As a result,
   little opportunity is afforded to physicians to deal with personal
   illness experiences, be they their own or those of loved ones.
   This article describes a reflective writing exercise conducted in a
   second-year medical student humanities seminar. The ``personal illness
   narrative{''} exercise created a medium for students to elicit,
   interpret, and translate their personal illness experiences while
   witnessing their colleagues' stories. Qualitative analysis of students'
   evaluation comments indicated that the exercise, although emotionally
   challenging, was well received and highly recommended for other students
   and residents. The reflective writing exercise may be incorporated into
   medical curricula aimed at increasing trainees' empathy. Affording
   Students and residents an opportunity to describe and share their
   illness experiences may counteract the traditional distancing of
   physicians' minds from their bodies and lead to more empathic and

Abstract = {{We investigated consultations at the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital
   (GHH), by the use of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a
   purposive sample of 14 patients. Interviews (lasting 1-2 h) were taped
   and transcribed verbatim. Analysis was based on a grounded theory
   approach. Two main categories of themes emerged: (1) those ``outside{''}
   the consultation, related to expectations, initially formed from
   experiences of family and friends, but then strengthened by ongoing
   attendance at GHH; and (2) themes ``inside{''} the consultation
   including length of consultations, the whole-person approach, being
   treated as an individual, and telling and having their ``story{''}
   listened to in depth. Equality of relationship, mutual respect, and
   sharing decisions were also prominent themes. In conclusion, patients
   attending the GHH highly value the holistic approach, and view time,
   empathy, and the therapeutic relationship as being of key importance.

Abstract = {{In view of many changes taking place in today's health care marketplace,
   the theme of empathy in health provider-patient relations needs to be
   revisited. It has been proposed that patients benefit when all members
   of the health care team provide empathic care. Despite the role of
   empathy in patient outcomes, empirical research on empathy among health
   professionals is scarce partly because of a lack of a psychometrically
   sound tool to measure it. In this study, we briefly describe the
   development and validation of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE), an instrument that was specifically developed to measure empathy
   among health professionals (20 Likert-type items). The purpose of this
   study was to compare nurses anti physicians on their responses to the
   JSPE. Study participants were 56 female registered nurses and 42 female
   physicians in the Internal Medicine postgraduate medical education
   program at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. The reliability
   coefficients (Chronbach's coefficient alpha) were 0.87 for the nurses
   and 0.89 for physicians. Results of t test showed no significant
   difference between nurses and physicians on total scores of the JSPE;
   however, multivariate analyses of variance indicated statistically
   significant differences between the two groups on 5 of 20 items of the
   JSPE. Findings suggest that the JSPE is a reliable research tool that
   can be used to assess empathy among health professionals including
   nurses.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical decision making can be described as answering one question:
   ``What is the best next thing for this patient at this time?{''} In
   addition to incorporating clinical information, research evidence, and
   patient preferences, the process requires considering contextual factors
   that are unique to each patient and relevant to their care. The failure
   to do so, thereby compromising that care, can be called a ``contextual
   error.{''} Although proponents of evidence-based clinical decision
   making and many scholars of the medical interview emphasize the
   importance of individualizing care, no operational definition is
   provided for the concept, nor is any methodology proposed for the
   interpretation of clinically relevant patient-specific variables. By
   conceptualizing the physician-patient encounter as a
   participant-observer case study with an N of 1, this essay describes how
   existing approaches to studying social systems can provide clinicians
   with a systematic approach to individualizing their clinical decision
   making.}},

Abstract = {{Moral agency is an important constituent of the nursing role. We
   explored issues of ethical development in Greek nursing students during
   clinical practice at the beginning of their studies. Specifically, we
   aimed to explore students' lived experience of ethics, and their
   perceptions and understanding of encountered ethical conflicts through
   phenomenological analysis of written narratives.
   The process of developing an awareness of personal values through
   empathizing with patients was identified as the core theme of the
   students' experience. Six more common themes were identified.
   Development of the students' moral awareness was conceptualized as a set
   of stages, commencing with empathizing with patients and nurses, moving
   on to taking a moral stand and, finally, concluding by becoming aware of
   their personal values and showing evidence of an emerging professional
   moral personhood. The notions of empathy, caring and emotion were in
   evidence throughout the students' experience. Implications for practice
   and nurse education are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The emphasis in medical education on viewing the patient as
   a whole person addresses current concerns about the negative impact of
   standard physician training that may lead to impaired patient-physician
   relationships.
   Purposes: To assess self-ratings of empathy, spirituality, wellness, and
   tolerance in a sample of medical students and practitioners to explore
   differences by gender, age, and training.
   Methods: A survey was created that assesses empathy, spirituality,
   wellness, and tolerance in the medical setting. Surveys were completed
   anonymously by medical students and practitioners from the medical
   school.
   Results: The youngest groups scored highest on empathy and wellness and
   lowest on tolerance. Participation in medical school wellness sessions
   correlated with higher empathy and wellness scores; participation in
   both empathy and spirituality sessions correlated with higher empathy
   scores.
   Conclusion: Exposure to educational activities in empathy, philosophical
   values and meaning, and wellness during medical school may increase
   empathy and wellness in medical practice. Copyright (C) 2004 by Lawrence

Abstract = {{CONTEXT Despite growing interest in medical communication by
   certification bodies, significant methodological and logistic challenges
   are evident in experiential methods of instruction.
   OBJECTIVE There were three study objectives: 1) to explore the
   acceptability of an innovative video feedback programme to residents and
   faculty; 2) to evaluate a brief teaching intervention comprising the
   video feedback innovation when linked to a one-hour didactic and
   role-play teaching session on paediatric residents' communication with a
   simulated patient; and 3) to explore the impact of resident gender on
   communication change.
   DESIGN Pre/post comparison of residents' performance in videotaped
   interviews with simulated patients before and after the teaching
   intervention. Individually tailored feedback on targeted communication
   skills was facilitated by embedding the Roter Interaction Analysis
   System (RIAS) within a software platform that presents a fully coded
   interview with instant search and review features.
   SETTING/PARTICIPANTS 28 first year residents in a large, urban,
   paediatric residency programme.
   RESULTS Communication changes following the teaching intervention were
   demonstrated through significant improvements in residents' performance
   with simulated patients pre and post teaching and feedback. Using paired
   t-tests, differences include: reduced verbal dominance; increased use of
   open-ended questions; increased use of empathy; and increased
   partnership building and problem solving for therapeutic regimen
   adherence. Female residents demonstrated greater communication change
   than males.
   CONCLUSIONS The RIAS embedded CD-ROM provides a flexible structure for
   individually tailoring feedback of targeted communication skills that is
   effective in facilitating communication change as part of a very brief
   teaching intervention.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND This paper discusses the rationale behind, and an approach
   to, the development of a graduate level interdisciplinary curriculum in
   literature and health care that incorporates community-based learning.
   Such an innovative approach emerges from the recognition that
   professional training in both health care and humanities programmes
   often does not model the kinds of collaborative relationships and
   professional values desired by contemporary health care students,
   providers and patients.
   METHOD Recent trends in literary study and the medical humanities are
   described, along with the function (and benefits to students) of
   interdisciplinary classrooms and the role of community-based learning in
   higher education. The authors discuss their experiences teaching, and
   offer students' responses to medical humanities courses from which the
   concept for such a curriculum evolved. The paper offers advice on
   developing, evaluating and disseminating such a model curriculum for
   medical, nursing and graduate literature students.
   Proposal By linking health care with graduate English literature
   students, such a course would promote dialogue and understanding among
   health professionals, enhance student awareness of the effects of
   illness on patients, their caregivers and families, and encourage
   student activism and community service. A common set of literary works
   would provide a shared vocabulary and opportunities for ethical,
   critical and personal response. Working together in a community-based
   project, students from diifferent programmes would learn to appreciate
   alternative professional and lay perspectives on common experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Even for patients receiving complex, intensive medical care for serious
   and life-threatening illness, family caregiving is typically at the core
   of what sustains patients at the end of life. The amorphous relationship
   between physicians and the families of patients at the end of life
   presents both challenges and opportunities for which physicians may be
   unprepared. Families play important roles in the practical and emotional
   aspects of patient care and in decision making at the end of life. At
   the same time, family members may carry significant burdens as a result
   of their work. Through the perspectives of the wife, daughter, and home
   care nurse of a patient who died from pancreatic cancer, we illustrate
   the range of family caregiver experiences and suggest potentially
   helpful physician interventions. We describe 5 burdens of family
   caregiving (time and logistics, physical tasks, financial costs,
   emotional burdens and mental health risks, and physical health risks)
   and review the responsibilities of physicians to family caregivers.
   Based on available evidence, we identify 5 areas of opportunity for
   physicians to be of service to family members caring for patients at the
   end of life, including promoting excellent communication with family,
   encouraging appropriate advance care planning and decision making,
   supporting home care, demonstrating empathy for family emotions and
   relationships, and attending to family grief and bereavement. In caring
   well for family caregivers at the end of life, physicians may not only
   improve the experiences of patients and family but also find greater
   sustenance and meaning in their own work.}},

Abstract = {{A sample of 51 homeless people in Cambridge, UK completed a
   questionnaire featuring adapted Animal Empathy and Companion Animal
   Bonding Scales. Concepts of crime, drug use, and health matters amongst
   the homeless, both dog owning and non-dog owning, were investigated, as
   well. Ninety members of the general public completed a similar
   questionnaire which sought their opinions on homeless people who own
   dogs. There was a highly significant difference (p < 0.01) between the
   homeless and the securely housed on their animal empathy and attachment
   scores, with the homeless sample displaying higher values. Gender and
   dog ownership status had no effect on these scores. A near significant
   result (U = F, 2, n(1) = 13, n(2) = 58, p = 0.06) was revealed for
   animal empathy scores of those who gave money to dog-owning homeless
   people and those who gave to non-dog owning homeless people. Of the
   public respondents, women were significantly more likely to show concern
   for a homeless person's dog's welfare than men (X-(1)(2)= 8.5, p <
   0.01), and of the homeless respondents, non-dog owners were
   significantly more likely than dog owners to believe that having a dog
   helped initiate conversations with the public (X2(,) = 4.0, p < 0.05).
   Highly significant differences (U = 10, n(1) = 31, n(2)= 20, p < 0.01)
   were found for medical care use between the dog-owning and non-dog
   owning homeless, and health scores showed a reversed trend compared to
   that expected for the general population, with dog owners scoring lower
   than non-dog owners. (c) 2004 International Sociely for Anthrozoology.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have shown that alexithymia is associated
   with a wide range of somatic and psychiatric conditions. The aim of this
   study was to investigate experimentally how psychosocial communication
   and empathic response from the physician affects satisfaction in
   alexithymic and non-alexithymic patients. Method: Seven physicians and
   65 female patients from a fibromyalgia patient association participated
   in the study. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was used to
   categorise patients as alexithymic or non-alexithymic. Patients also
   completed questionnaires regarding trait anxiety and satisfaction with
   their consultation. Physicians were instructed to differentiate their
   communication in terms of both psychosocial matters and empathic
   response. The content of the consultation was analysed using the Roter
   Interactional Analysis System. Results: Regression analyses revealed
   that alexithymic patients were significantly more satisfied when they
   received a greater empathic response from the physician. Non-alexithymic
   patients, however, were more satisfied when the consultation was of
   longer duration. Psychosocial communication did not have any
   statistically significant effect on satisfaction in either of the two
   subgroups. Conclusions: Verbalised empathic response from the physician
   may be crucial for the alexithymic patient's post-consultation
   satisfaction and may thereby become the basis for a solid treatment
   alliance. The validity of this hypothesis should be tested in different
   clinical settings and with different patient populations. Future
   research on alexithymic patients' response to psychosocial communication
   may benefit from determining to what extent this communication is
   concerned with general distress or more complex emotional phenomena.}},

Title = {{Analytic global OSCE ratings are sensitive to level of training}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1012-1016}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose There are several reasons for using global ratings in addition
   to checklists for scoring objective structured clinical examination
   (OSCE) stations. However, there has been little evidence collected
   regarding the validity of these scales. This study assessed the
   construct validity of an analytic global rating with 4 component
   subscales: empathy, coherence, verbal and non-verbal expression.
   Methods A total of 19 Year 3 and 38 Year 4 clinical clerks were scored
   on content checklists and these global ratings during a 10-station OSCE.
   T-tests were used to assess differences between groups for overall
   checklist and global scores, and for each of the 4 subscales.
   Results The mean global rating was significantly higher for senior
   clerks (75.5\% versus 71.3\%, t(55) = 2.12, P < 0.05) and there were
   significant differences by level of training for the coherence (t(55) =
   3.33, P < 0.01) and verbal communication (t(55) = 2.33, P < 0.05)
   subscales. Interstation reliability was 0.70 for the global rating and
   ranged from 0.58 to 0.65 for the subscales. Checklist reliability was
   0.54.
   Conclusion In this study, a summated analytic global rating demonstrated
   construct validity, as did 2 of the 4 scales measuring specific traits.
   In addition, the analytic global rating showed substantially higher
   internal consistency than did the checklists, a finding consistent with
   that seen in previous studies cited in the literature. Global ratings
   are an important element of OSCE measurement and can have good
   psychometric properties. However, OSCE researchers should clearly
   describe the type of global ratings they use. Further research is needed
   to define the most effective global rating scales.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Since the 1990s, as many women as men have
   been entering and graduating from medical schools in Western countries.
   Up to date, prospective studies of physicians' career paths are lacking.
   This paper presents the data of the first assessment of a longitudinal
   survey of a cohort of Swiss medical school graduates, evaluated with
   regard to how gender and personality traits contribute to their academic
   achievement and further career planning.
   Methods: In 2001, 719 graduate students (52.9\% females, 47.1\% males)
   returned a postal questionnaire comprising sections on personality
   traits, career motivation, and career planning.
   Results: Female graduates scored higher on traits such as helpfulness,
   relationship consciousness, empathy, family responsibility, and job
   security. Male students scored higher on traits such as independence,
   decisiveness, self-confidence, activity, income, and prestige. Women
   were further advanced in the writing of their thesis (p = 0.04), chose
   different topics (p < 0.001), and had more often decided in which field
   they wished to specialise (p = .02). Women preferred fields with
   intensive patient contact (p < 0.01), men tended to specialise more in
   instrumentally oriented and high-technology medicine (p < .001). The
   regression model revealed that, apart from gender (being female),
   instrumentality and extrinsic career motivation predict advanced
   academic achievement, whereas self-esteem and intrinsic career
   motivation influence the choice of speciality.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that women plan their career more
   purposefully than men, and that not only gender but also personality
   traits and career motivation play an important role in academic
   achievement and career planning.}},

Abstract = {{The Program in Medical Humanities \& Arts at the University of
   California, Irvine, College of Medicine has been in existence for five
   years. The program was implemented to enhance aspects of professionalism
   including empathy, altruism, compassion, and caring toward patients, as
   well as to hone clinical communication and observational skills. It
   contains elective or required curriculum across all four years of
   medical school and required curriculum in two residency programs,
   organized according to structural principles of horizontal coherence,
   vertical complexity, and patient care applications.
   The program emphasizes small-group, interdisciplinary teaching and
   faculty development, and is notable for learners' use of creative
   projects to reflect on patients and themselves. Evaluation of the
   program indicates a positive response among learners. More systematic
   studies point to increases in empathy and positive attitudes toward the
   humanities as tools for professional development as a result of exposure
   to the program curriculum. Future directions include closer
   collaboration with the University of California, Irvine, Schools of the
   Arts and Humanities, involvement of local artists and writers, and
   development of a graduation with distinction in humanities for medical
   students.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Student exposure to illness-related theatrical performances
   holds intriguing educational possibilities. This project explored uses
   of theatrical performance within the context of medical education.
   Method Two 1-person shows, dramatically addressing AIDS and ovarian
   cancer, were presented to audiences totalling approximately 150 medical
   students, faculty, community doctors, staff and patients.
   Results Evaluations for both performances indicated increased
   understanding of the illness experience and greater empathy for
   patients. They also showed that respondents obtained additional insights
   into patient care issues, and developed new ways of thinking about their
   situations.
   Conclusions Presenting illness-related dramatic performances as an
   adjunct method of enhancing empathy and insight toward patients in a
   self-selected group of students, doctors, staff and patients was
   successful. Although this approach might not be effective with all
   learners, those who participated felt they gained important insights
   into the nature of the patient experience.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Training in empathy and compassion can foster altruism in
   medical students.
   Description: To use the drama Wit in an experiential learning module for
   first-year medical students. Students and faculty received tickets to a
   Wit performance. Students heard a pre-play lecture on end-of-life care
   and attended a post-play discussion with the cast. Each attendee
   completed an evaluation survey for the Wit Educational Initiative, and
   site-specific responses were computed. Students reflected on their
   experience in an e-mail dialogue with clinical faculty. Students could
   also earn extra credit by completing a written assignment.
   Evaluation: Attendance was excellent-99\% of the class and 59\% of their
   preceptors. Most rated the performance as ``excellent{''} or ``very
   good{''} and reported they were moved emotionally. Reflecting on the
   performance, students admired the ``science{''} of medicine but found
   the ``art{''} of medicine lacking.
   Conclusion: When used effectively, theater can be used to promote
   attitude change. Copyright (C) 2003 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Patients seek empathy from their physicians. Medical educators
   increasingly recognize this need. Yet in seeking to make empathy a
   reliable professional skill, doctors change the meaning of the term.
   Outside the field of medicine, empathy is a mode of understanding that
   specifically involves emotional resonance. In contrast, leading
   physician educators define empathy as a form of detached cognition. In
   contrast, this article argues that physicians' emotional attunement
   greatly serves the cognitive goal of understanding patients' emotions.
   This has important implications for teaching empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Listening to music has rarely been used by educators as a tool to teach
   humanism to medical students and residents. The authors present the
   argument that music embodies the characteristics of medical humanism
   (i.e., caring, empathy, human dignity, compassion, and the fostering of
   relationships) and that listening to music is ideally suited for
   inclusion in a humanism curriculum. The authors also describe an
   eight-session ``music and medicine{''} course for residents given at
   their institution as part of an ongoing humanism-in-medicine initiative.
   The results of a post-course survey given to the participants showed
   that residents valued the course as an academically valid approach to

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing emphasis on patient-centered care and other
   recent developments should make patient expectations increasingly
   important in ophthalmology. Motivated by the pivotal role of patient
   expectations in quality-of-care assessments and by the limited knowledge
   about patients' expectations regarding eye care, we initiated a pilot
   study using focus groups to. determine a relevant set of concerns that
   patients express as expectations.
   Methods: A total of 6 focus groups were conducted with patients at Duke
   University Eye Center (Durham, NC). Focus groups ranged in size from 4
   to 10 people. The average group size was 6.
   Results: Content analysis of transcripts from the 6 focus groups yielded
   22 areas of expectations for eye care, which were classified into 5
   categories: communication, interpersonal manner, physician's skill,
   logistics, and other. The 6 areas that appeared to be of greatest
   importance to focus group participants were the following: (1) honesty,
   (2) information about. diagnosis and prognosis, (3) explanation in clear
   language, (4) ophthalmologist's experience and, reputation, (5) empathy,
   and (6) listening and addressing concerns.
   Conclusions: In general, ophthalmology patients in the focus groups
   emphasized expectations related to communication and interpersonal
   manner. In contrast to previous studies with primary care patients,
   however, ophthalmology patients expressed few expectations for technical
   interventions, such a's medication prescriptions, physical examination,
   or diagnostic testing.}},

Abstract = {{Attention to providers' communication skills is likely to increase,
   given the confluence of forces that have highlighted the importance of
   communication in healthcare. In the United States, interpersonal and
   communication skills have been explicitly identified as a priority
   throughout the continuum of medical education and practice. Ideally,
   theory and research inform teaching and assessment efforts by suggesting
   how communication behavior affects outcomes and by providing a
   conceptual framework for learning skills. This article illustrates the
   interplay between education and research by discussing examples of
   useful concepts (models of communication, issues of perceived control,
   and patterns of non-verbal communication) and understudied topics
   (physician verbalizations during patients' initial narratives, the
   mundane aspects of communication in healthcare, conceptual and
   operational definitions of empathy, and the effect of patient narratives
   on both patients and providers). Given the breadth and depth of
   experience, from screening and prevention to treatment and support, the
   context of cancer offers a promising laboratory for enhancing both
   education and research about provider-patient communication. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to investigate the association of physician
   communication behaviours as perceived by the patient with patient
   reported satisfaction, distress, cancer-related self-efficacy, and
   perceived control over the disease in cancer patients. Questionnaires
   measuring distress, self efficacy, and perceived control were completed
   prior to and after the consultation by 454 patients attending an
   oncology outpatient clinic, After the consultation, the patients also
   rated the physicians' communicative behaviours by completing a
   patient-physician relationship inventory (PPRI), and the physicians were
   asked to estimate patient satisfaction. The overall results showed that
   higher PPRI scores of physician attentiveness and empathy were
   associated with greater patient satisfaction, increased self-efficacy,
   and reduced emotional distress following the consultation, In contrast,
   lower PPRI scores were associated with reduced ability of the physician
   to estimate patient satisfaction. The results confirm and expand
   previous findings, suggesting that communication is a core clinical
   skill in oncology. (C) 2003 Cancer Research UK.}},

Abstract = {{Fear of injections may interfere with receipt of vaccines. The
   frequency, associations, and precipitators of fear-provoking factors of
   400 travelers visiting a travel health clinic were evaluated. The median
   age of this group was 25, 7\% were medical staff members, and 2.8\% were
   regular injectors (insulin). Eighty-five (21.7\%; 95\% confidence
   interval, 17.3-25.6\%) of the travelers indicated that they were afraid
   of injections, and in 8.2\%, the fear was unreasonably intense.
   Multivariate analysis revealed that watching other people being
   vaccinated, fear of pain, needle size, and a history of fainting were
   highly and independently associated with injection phobia. The
   sensitivity, specificity, and discrimination accuracy of this model were
   79.5\%, 78.0\%, and 78.3\%, respectively. Injection phobia and a bad
   past vaccination experience were significantly associated with fainting.
   Perceived empathy, on the other hand, was a significant protective
   factor. Fear of injections was common in this cohort and was highly
   associated with past fainting after vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine patient preferences for age-, gender-, and
   racial/ethnic-concordant primary care physicians.
   Design: Focus group interviews.
   Patients and Setting: Forty-nine adults (African Americans, Caucasians,
   and Latinos) receiving their outpatient medical care in university-based
   primary care clinics in Northern California.
   Main Measures and Results: Guiding questions were designed to elicit
   information about what patients look for in establishing and maintaining
   a therapeutic relationship with a primary care physician. Patients were
   prompted to provide examples and to discuss demographic-concorclance
   factors. Many participants felt that their continuity of care was poor
   and that they could not choose their own primary care physicians in the
   academic system. Most reported tolerating these inconveniences for what
   they perceived to be a higher quality of care linked to medical
   innovations at academic medical centers. Patients' views regarding age
   concordance were varied and unrelated to gender or racial/ethnic group.
   Women in all English-proficient groups described gender concordance as
   important to their relationships with primary care physicians.
   Spanish-speaking participants uniformly preferred Spanish-speaking
   providers. African-American participants and Spanish-speaking Latino men
   felt that race/ethnic concordance contributed to a practitioner's
   empathy, and some were concerned by the lack of race/ethnic- or
   language-concordant doctors.
   Conclusions: Examining patients' preferences for patient-physician
   demographic concordance provides insight into the patient-physician
   relationship. Addressing areas where these preferences affect
   communication patterns and perceptions of quality of care may lead to
   overall improvements in patient-physician relationships and health
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Small local colleges may be sources of medical students with
   the gender, ethnicity, and background that promote identity with and
   empathy for underserved populations. Purpose: This study examine the
   impact of attendance at these premedical colleges on outcomes of medical
   education. Methods: Data for 2508 matriculated to the University of
   Alabama School of Medicine, a state-support medical school, were
   examined according to premedical colleges attended. Findings: Medical
   students who had graduated from small local college were more diverse in
   gender, race, and rural background than other students. They had
   slightly lower academic performance in medical school, were more likely
   to drop out (10.6\% versus 5.2\% overall), and were more likely to
   locate in rural areas of the host state. Conclusions: Small local
   colleges may be rich sources of student diversity and medical students
   who choose rural practice, outcomes that are gained at a cost in terms
   of drop-out rate. Compared with other students, minor differences in
   performance and larger differences in the drop-out rate raise the
   question of cultural context and social support during medical school as
   points for intervention.}},

Journal = {{NURSING CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) refers to a personality disorder
   whose primary symptoms include significant emotional distress and
   impairment of interpersonal or occupational functioning or both {[}1].
   The age of onset varies but often ranges from adolescence to early
   adulthood (age 18 to 25 years) {[}2]. Typically the patient with BPD has
   a history of a pervasive pattern of chaotic interpersonal relationships,
   unstable mood and self-image disturbances, self-injurious behaviors, and
   other maladaptive coping behaviors. Major concerns of nurses and other
   health care providers involve the high use of health care resources
   among patients with BPD, normally arising from self-destructive and
   demanding behaviors.
   The precise prevalence of BPD is obscure, but estimates are about 2\% in
   community samples and 6\% of a primary care population {[}3] and
   approximately 15\% to 20\% of psychiatric inpatients {[}1,4-6]. Severity
   of symptoms may range from moderately disabling to severely
   incapacitating. BPD also is likely to co-occur with other psychiatric
   conditions, including anxiety disorders, major depressive disorders,
   eating disorders, and substance-related disorders, and medical
   conditions (eg, somatization disorders). Women are two times more likely
   to be diagnosed with BPD than men {[}1,4-6].
   A major issue confronting nurses and other health care providers is the
   high suicidality and other self-injurious behaviors among patients with
   BPD. One in 10 patients with BPD completes suicide, but suicide is not
   readily preventable, and it does not necessarily occur during treatment
   {[}7]. Chronic suicidal behavior is best understood as a barometer of
   the patient's level of distress. Hospitalization has not been shown to
   reduce suicide and often has negative results. Community studies have
   shown that the rates of suicide peak between the ages of 18 and 30 years
   {[}8]. The highest risk of suicide among patients with BPD occurs in
   those with comorbid substance-related and depressive illness and
   histories of past attempts. Normally, patients presenting with acute
   suicidality also meet criteria for depressive illness. In comparison,
   patients presenting with chronic suicidal ideations are seeking
   treatment {[}9].
   Because patients with BPD are high users of health care resources, most
   nurses have had contact with these patients. The patient with BPD often
   challenges the patience of nurses-hence the risk of rejection and poor
   treatment outcomes. This article focuses on strategies that can improve
   treatment outcomes. It also describes the role of the nurse in
   developing therapeutic environments that convey empathy, establish clear
   and healthy boundaries, and facilitate appropriate limit settings and an
   optimal level of functioning. Finally, this article provides an overview
   of the complexity of this challenging personality disorder, causative
   factors, assessment and diagnostic considerations, and holistic and
   interdisciplinary treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The need to reach professionalism during residency has been affirmed by
   the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which wilt
   require documentation of education and evaluation of professionalism by
   2007. Recently the American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed the
   following components of professionalism be taught and measured:
   honesty/integrity, reliability/responsibility, respect for others,
   compassion/empathy, self-improvement, self-awareness/knowledge of
   limits, communication/collaboration, and altruism/advocacy. The authors
   describe a curriculum for introducing the above principles of
   professionalism into a pediatrics residency that could serve as a model
   for other programs. The curriculum is taught at an annual five-day
   retreat for interns, with 11 mandatory sessions devoted to addressing
   key professionalism issues. The authors also explain how the retreat is
   evaluated and how the retreat's topics are revisited during the
   residency, and discuss general issues of teaching and evaluating
   professionalism.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to gain more empirical ideas for the concept
   of patient satisfaction and its usefulness as an instrument for quality
   assurance by analyzing the relationship between inpatient experiences
   and inpatient satisfaction with psychiatric services. Data were obtained
   from 91 inpatients of the Psychiatric Hospital of the
   Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich (85\% of all patients who had
   been in hospital at least 3 weeks and who could be asked) by
   questionnaires on a fixed day. Patients had been asked about their
   overall satisfaction as well as their experiences with special aspects
   of the services. Overall satisfaction was high, but there was a
   remarkable amount of adverse experience with components concerning
   patient information and time with a psychiatrist offered to the
   patients. The results give evidence that communication and empathy of
   the medical staff are key indicators of patient satisfaction and
   dissatisfaction. Furthermore, results suggest that global satisfaction
   scores should not be used as an instrument of quality assurance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To identify factors that patients perceive as influencing
   control in living with the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Method. A sample of 40 patients with RA were recruited randomly from an
   out-patient population. The participants of the sample were interviewed
   in depth by one researcher to identify perceptions of control. They also
   completed two self-administered questionnaires, the Health Assessment
   Questionnaire and the Rheumatology Attitude Index.
   Results. Four major categories were identified that positively
   influenced perceptions of control in patients living with the
   consequences of RA. These included: (i) the reduction of physical
   symptoms; (ii) social support matching perceived need; (iii) the
   provision of information; and (iv) the medical consultation. Components
   of the consultation included patient involvement, provision of
   information, feedback and reassurance, empathy and access to an expert.
   Conclusion. The categories identified can be influenced by health-care
   professionals in the management of the patient, and if the medical
   consultation is utilized to its full potential it can play a major role
   in enabling patients with RA to manage the daily symptoms of their
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Patients and their care providers are increasingly turning to the
   internet for information. Being faced with this information of very
   heterogeneous quality, the physician would do well to be informed about
   the common internet information sources.
   We investigated the e-mails of a mailing list (or ``support group{''})
   serving about 380 brain tumour patients and their care providers. The
   mails were obtained from an archive and grouped according to their
   topic.
   Within 6 months, 3 272 e-mails were distributed to every group member.
   Alternative treatments were the most frequently discussed topics (15\%).
   These discussions dealt with serious new strategies as well as dubious
   drugs and methods. A critical attitude towards ``quacks{''} was common,
   but not the rule.
   More than 10\% of the mails dealt with debates about therapeutic
   strategy and about symptoms. The individual course of the participants'
   illness was often reported very frankly. Emotional support between
   members played another great role in the support group.
   Criticism of physicians was rare compared to recommendations of specific
   therapists (3\% vs. 4\%) and included lack of empathy or sensibility and
   poor communication between physicians. The brain tumour mailing list is
   a communication medium for brain tumour patients and their care
   providers, which distributes and reproduces information of heterogeneous
   quality.
   The physician faced with this information should be unbiased but
   cautious.}},

Abstract = {{Although empathy in the physician-patient relationship is often
   advocated, a theoretically based and empirically derived measure of a
   physician's empathic communication to a patient has been missing. This
   paper describes the development and initial validation of such a
   measure, the Empathic Communication Coding System (ECCS), which includes
   a method for identifying patient-created empathic opportunities. To
   determine the extent to which empathic communication varies with
   physician and patient gender, we used the ECCS to code 100 videotaped
   office visits between patients and general internists. While male and
   female patients created a comparable number of empathic opportunities,
   those created by females tended to exhibit more emotional intensity than
   those created by males. However, female patients were no more likely
   than male patients to name an emotion in their empathic opportunities.
   Physician communication behavior was consistent with the literature on
   gender differences: female physicians tended to communicate higher
   degrees of empathy in response to the empathic opportunities created by
   patients. The ECCS appears to be a viable and sensitive tool for better
   understanding empathy in medical encounters, and for detecting modest
   gender differences in patients' creation of empathic opportunities and
   in physicians' empathic communication. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the symbolism of the white coat and the nature of
   authority as employed in the White Coat Ceremony for incoming first-year
   medical students. Little has been written concerning the rapid spread,
   bioethical implications or theoretical underpinnings of this ceremony
   despite adoption by over 100 medical schools in the United States,
   international recognition by medical schools in Israel and as the
   subject of recent editorial opinion in the United Kingdom.
   Summary: The short white coat can be a highly useful tool allowing
   patients to identify practitioners in a liminal state. However, by
   officially sanctioning the white coat as a sign of the psychological
   contract of professionalism and empathy, the medical establishment may
   be responding to abrogations of its own authority and is teaching
   students that they are respected for their sartorial behavior separate
   from their behavior as individuals.
   Conclusion: The White Coat Ceremony fosters a sense of entitlement
   whereby authority based on title and uniform, and authority based on
   trust, are poorly distinguished.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate a special study module in literature and medicine
   that aimed for clinical relevance.
   Methods We organised a 4-week course around themes such as empathy,
   death and dying, disability, madness and creativity, addiction, domestic
   violence, ethical dilemmas, doctor patient communication, doctors'
   emotions and end of life decisions. We used a diversity of texts and
   genres to address these themes. We explicitly encouraged the students to
   engage with both content and form when studying literature. To evaluate
   the course we used a nominal group technique. Students identified a
   range of items in response to open questions about the content and
   methods of the course. After clarifying and reducing the items
   generated, they ranked them in order of importance. To investigate
   perceived clinical relevance, we grouped the individual items into
   broader themes using a previously suggested taxonomy of clinical
   relevance.
   Results The students attached the highest importance to the insights
   gained into patients and their experience of illness. These encompassed
   aspects of understanding, knowledge and empathy. They also perceived
   that they had improved clinically relevant skills including
   communication, analysis, presentation, writing and ethical reasoning.
   The remaining items were more broadly concerned with themes of personal
   growth, development and pleasure.
   Conclusions There are many objectives in studying literature. We
   focussedon designing a special study module that explicitly emphasised
   clinical relevance. Our evaluation shows that students identified
   clinically relevant improvements in knowledge, skills and attitudes from
   having taken the course.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a complex, multi-dimensional concept that has moral
   cognitive, emotive and behavioural components Clinical empathy involves
   an ability to: (a) understand the patient: situation, perspective, and
   feelings (and their attached meanings); (h) to communicate that
   understanding and check its accuracy; and (c) to act on that
   understanding with the patient in a helpful (therapeutic) way Research
   on the effect of empathy on health outcomes in primary care is lacking,
   but studies in mental health and in nursing suggest it plays a key role.
   Empathy can be improved and successfully taught at medical school,
   especially if it is embedded in the student:5 actual experiences with
   patients. A variety of assessment and feedback techniques have also been
   used in general medicine, psychiatry, and nursing Further work is
   required to determine if clinical empathy needs to be, and can be,
   improved in the primary care setting.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To develop and evaluate the Patient Care Project (PCP), an
   integrated patient-centred, community-based learning activity,
   implemented at the University of Hong Kong since 1992.
   Design The PCP, a required course in the first 2 preclinical years, is
   structured into four learning cycles over 9 months. Each cycle consists
   of a patient interview followed by a debriefing group tutorial. In-depth
   interviews with the same patient allow students to explore the impact of
   disease and patients' illness experience, as well as the contribution of
   the wider determinants of health to their condition. The debriefing
   tutorial frames empirical observations into theoretical models and its
   format reinforces habits of problem-based learning. The programme was
   evaluated using survey questionnaires completed by students, patients
   and tutors.
   Participants 324 first- and second-year medical students.
   Results Students, participating patients and tutors all rated the PCP
   positively in end-of-course evaluations. Specifically, 68\% of students
   commented that the PCP had met all or most of its stated objectives,
   while there was nearly unanimous agreement among patients that students
   demonstrated understanding and empathy in the visits and interviews.
   Tutor appraisal of student performance also indicated the attainment of
   all stated aims and objectives overall.
   Conclusions The PCP is a valuable contribution to community-based
   learning and the promotion of the patient-centred clinical method.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There is a dearth of empirical research on physician empathy
   despite its mediating role in patient-physician relationships and
   clinical outcomes, This study was designed to investigate the components
   of physician empathy, its measurement properties, and group differences
   in empathy scores.
   Method: A revised version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (with 20 Likert-type items) was mailed to 1,007 physicians affiliated
   with the Jefferson Health System in the greater Philadelphia region; 704
   (70\%) responded, Construct validity, reliability of the empathy scale,
   and the differences on mean empathy scores by physicians' gender and
   specialty were examined.
   Results: Three meaningful factors emerged (perspective taking,
   compassionate care, and standing in the patient's shoes) to provide
   support for the construct validity of the empathy scale that was also
   found to be internally consistent with relatively stable scores over
   time. Women scored higher than men to a degree that was nearly
   significant. With control for gender, psychiatrists scored a mean
   empathy rating that was significantly higher than that of physicians
   specializing in anesthesiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery,
   radiology, cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and
   general surgery. No significant difference was observed on empathy
   scores among physicians specializing in psychiatry, internal medicine,
   pediatrics, emergency medicine, and family medicine.
   Conclusions: Empathy is a multidimensional concept that varies among
   physicians and can be measured with a psychometrically sound tool.
   Implications for specialty selection and career counseling are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the attitudes, feelings, and beliefs of mothers
   and pediatric emergency department health care providers toward routine
   intimate partner violence screening.
   Methods: This qualitative project employed focus groups of mothers who
   brought their children to a children's hospital emergency department for
   care, and physicians and nurses who staffed the same department. We held
   6 ethnically homogeneous mother focus groups (2 white, 2 African
   American, and 2 Latina) and 4 provider focus groups (2 predominately
   female nurse focus groups and 2 physician groups: 1 male and 1 female).
   Professional moderators conducted the sessions using a semistructured
   discussion guide. All groups were audiotaped and videotaped, and tapes
   were reviewed for recurring themes.
   Results: A total of 59 mothers, 21 nurses, and 17 physicians
   participated. Mothers identified intimate partner violence as a common
   problem in their communities, and most remarked that routine screening
   for adult intimate partner violence is an appropriate activity for a
   pediatric emergency department. However, many expressed concern that
   willingness to disclose might be affected by a fear of being reported to
   child protective services. They stressed the importance of addressing
   the child's health problem first, that screening be done in an
   empathetic way, and that immediate assistance be available if needed.
   Themes identified in the provider groups included concerns about time
   constraints, fear of offending, and concerns that unless immediate
   intervention was available, the victim could be placed in jeopardy. Many
   said they would feel obligated to notify child protective services on
   disclosure of intimate partner violence.
   Conclusions: Intimate partner violence screening protocols in the
   pediatric emergency department should take into consideration the
   beliefs and attitudes of both those doing the screening and those being
   screened. Those developing screening protocols for a pediatric emergency
   department should consider the following: (1) that those assigned to
   screen must demonstrate empathy, warmth, and a helping attitude; (2) the
   importance of addressing the child's medical needs first, and a
   screening process that is minimally disruptive to the emergency
   department; (3) a defined, organized approach to assessing danger to the
   child, and how and when it is appropriate to notify child protective
   services when a caregiver screens positive for intimate partner
   violence; and (4) that resources must be available immediately to a
   victim who requests them.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe an exercise, the structure and content of which
   assists medical students to conduct potentially embarrassing
   conversations concerning sexual health which require expression of
   empathy, to integrate previous learning, to identify their further
   learning needs, and to develop and test strategies to meet these needs.
   Method: Students' role play, sequentially, speakers (patients) and
   listeners (clinical students) in a ``carousel,{''} in which all students
   are engaged at all times in a sequence of pairings which change at rapid
   intervals. Half way through the exercise, students reflect on the
   experience, identify difficulties and successes, and develop and share
   strategies for experimental use in the second half of the exercise.
   Results: Qualitative comments from the written student evaluations are
   reported.
   Conclusions: The exercise provides a formative student centred approach
   to the integration and further development of previously learnt
   knowledge and skills of value for promoting sexual health education. It
   is useful for educators interested in promoting more open and informed
   learning about sexual health.}},

Abstract = {{Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) displays significant neuropathological and
   genetic heterogeneity among and within affected families. An early
   diagnosis is often difficult because cognitive symptoms are manifest
   only at a late stage of the disease. We have been studying a large
   pedigree segregating frontotemporal dementia (FTD) to which belong 34
   identified affected persons, 11 of whom were personally examined. The
   kindred has been genealogically reconstructed; all FTD patients have
   been linked to the same ancestors who lived in the early 18(th) century
   (11 generations before the present one). Autosomal dominant transmission
   was evident. Clinical features were uniform within the kindred and met
   the Lund-Manchester criteria. Personality changes with absence of
   insight, lack of empathy and of social awareness manifested up to 5
   years before medical advice was sought, Loss of fluency was the earliest
   neuropsychological sign, in the absence of memory, orientation and
   praxis deficits, which evolved late, together with hyperorality.
   Akinesia was observed early, rigidity appeared late, tremor was absent.
   Two patients showed myoclonus late in their evolution. No ALS signs were
   observed in this kindred. Mutations of the MAPt gene, coding for the Tau
   protein, were not detected in affected family members. Linkage studies
   excluded chromosomes 3 and 9 and gave indeterminate results that were
   model dependent for chromosome 17.}},

Abstract = {{Cinematic depictions of physicians potentially can affect public
   expectations and the patient-physician relationship, but little
   attention has been devoted to portrayals of physicians in movies. The
   objective of the study was the analysis of cinematic depictions of
   physicians to determine common demographic attributes of movie
   physicians, major themes, and whether portrayals have changed over time.
   All movies released on videotape with physicians as main characters and
   readily available to the public were viewed in their entirety. Data were
   collected on physician characteristics, diagnoses, and medical accuracy,
   and dialogue concerning physicians was transcribed, The results showed
   that in the 131 films, movie physicians were significantly more likely
   to be male (p < 0.00001), White (p < 0.00001), and < 40 years of age (p
   < 0.009). The proportion of women and minority film physicians has
   declined steadily in recent decades. Movie physicians are most commonly
   surgeons (33\%), psychiatrists (26\%), and family practitioners (18\%).
   Physicians were portrayed negatively in 44\% of movies, and since the
   1960s positive portrayals declined while negative portrayals increased.
   Physicians frequently are depicted as greedy, egotistical, uncaring, and
   unethical, especially in recent films. Medical inaccuracies occurred in
   27\% of films. Compassion and idealism were common in early physician
   movies but are increasingly scarce in recent decades, A recurrent theme
   is the ``mad scientist,{''} the physician-researcher that values
   research more than patients' welfare. Portrayals of physicians as
   egotistical and materialistic have increased, whereas sexism and racism
   have waned, Movies from the past two decades have explored critical
   issues surrounding medical ethics and managed care. We conclude that
   negative cinematic portrayals of physicians are on the rise, which may
   adversely affect patient expectations and the patient-physician
   relationship. Nevertheless, films about physicians can serve as useful
   gauges of public opinion about the medical profession, as tools for
   medical education, and as instruments of positive social change in
   efforts to reform managed care.}},

Abstract = {{The operational measurement of physician empathy, as well as the
   question of whether empathy could change at different levels of medical
   education, is of interest to medical educators. To address this issue,
   98 internal medicine residents from all 3 years of training were
   studied. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy was administered, and
   residents' empathy scores correlated with ratings on humanistic
   attributes made by postgraduate program directors. No statistically
   significant differences in scores were found among residents of
   different training levels. Empathy scores remained also stable during
   internship (test-retest reliability = 0.72). Correlation between empathy
   and ratings on humanism was 0.17. Thus, the findings suggest that
   empathy is a relatively stable trait that is not easily amenable to
   change in residency training programs. The issue of whether targeted
   educational activities for the purpose of cultivating empathy can
   improve empathy scores awaits empirical scrutiny.}},

Abstract = {{Context Internship is a time of great transition, during which mood
   disturbances are common. However, variations in mood and empathy levels
   throughout the internship year have not been investigated.
   Objective To examine mood patterns and changes in empathy among internal
   medicine residents over the course of the internship year.
   Design Cohort study of interns involving completion of survey
   instruments at 4 points: time I (June 2000; Profile of Mood States
   {[}POMS] and Interpersonal Reactivity Index {[}IRI]), times 2 and 3
   (November 2000 and February 2001; POMS), and time 4 (June 2001; POMS and
   IRI).
   Setting Internal medicine residency program at a University-based
   medical center.
   Participants Sixty-one interns.
   Main Outcome Measures Baseline scores of mood states and empathy; trends
   in mood states and empathy over the internship year.
   Results Response rates for time 1 were 98\%; for time 2, 72\%; for time
   3, 79\%; and for time 4, 79\%. Results of the POMS revealed that
   physicians starting their internship exhibit less tension, depression,
   anger, fatigue, and confusion and have more vigor than general adult and
   college student populations (P < .001 for all). Results of the IRI
   showed better baseline scores for perspective taking (P < .001) and
   empathic concern (P = .007) and lower scores for personal distress (P <
   .001) among interns compared with norms. Five months into internship,
   however, POMS scores revealed significant increases in the
   depression-dejection (P < .001), anger-hostility (P < .001), and
   fatigue-inertia (P < .001) scales, as well as an increase in IRI
   personal distress level (P < .001). These increases corresponded with
   decreases in the POMS vigor-activity scores (P < .001) and I RI empathic
   concern measures (P = .005). Changes persisted throughout the internship
   period.
   Conclusions We found that, in this sample, enthusiasm at the beginning
   of internship soon gave way to depression, anger, and fatigue. Future
   research should be aimed at determining whether these changes persist
   beyond internship.}},

Title = {{Evaluating physicians' professionalism and humanism: The case for

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{489-495}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Physicians' professionalism and humanism have become central foci of the
   efforts of medical educators as the public, various accrediting and
   licensing agencies, and the profession itself have expressed concerns
   about the apparent erosion of physicians' competency in these aspects of
   the art, rather than the science, of medicine. Of the many obstacles to
   enhancing trainees' skills in these domains, one of the most significant
   is the difficulty in assessing competency in physicians' professionalism
   and humanism. The author suggests that the assessment of these aspects
   of the art of medicine has more in common with the approaches used in
   criticism of the arts than with the quantitative assessment tools
   appropriate to the scientific method and the medical model. Quantitative
   and semi-quantitative tools, so effective in elucidating the etiology,
   pathophysiology, and treatment of disease, are often inappropriate and
   invalid when applied to evaluation of professional and humanistic
   competencies. The author proposes that humanism ``connoisseurs{''} be
   employed to qualitatively evaluate medical trainees' professionalism and
   humanism. Such connoisseurs Would possess expert knowledge, training,
   and experience in the interpersonal aspects of the art of medicine,
   allowing them to deconstruct concepts such as empathy, compassion,
   integrity, and respect into their respective key elements while
   evaluating physicians' behaviors as an integrated, Cohesive whole.
   Through the use of a rich descriptive vocabulary, humanism connoisseurs
   would provide valid formative and summative feedback regarding
   competency in medical professionalism and humanism. In the process, they
   would serve to Counteract the relative marginalization of
   professionalism and humanism in the informal and lived curricula of
   medical trainees.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The study examined the pattern of utilization of Maternal
   and Child Health (MCH)-services of women with child-bearing experience
   in a suburb of city Kabul.
   Methods. A semi-structured questionnaire administered to 100 women in
   the community and 40 in the maternal hospital. Interviews and
   observations in the local MCH-clinic were used to collect the relevant
   information.
   Results. Sixty one of the 100 women in the community delivered at home
   exclusively, 35 having experienced both home and institutional
   deliveries, four women had hospital childbirths only. Approximately half
   of the women decided about utilizing the modern MCH services themselves.
   Women valued in the MCH-clinic mainly medical care and vaccinations.
   Delivery was seen primarily as a technical event, but when probed more
   deeply it was obvious, that fear of death was the driving power for
   decisions made. With at-home deliveries female relatives were preferred
   as birth assistants. If outside assistance was required, trained
   midwives were preferred rather than traditional birth attendants.
   Institutional delivery was seen as the last resource for complicated
   deliveries, but was also esteemed by many because of the security and
   cleaness. Professional skill, but also empathy and justice were
   appreciated in professionals.
   Conclusions. Promoting rooming-in and early breast feeding in the
   maternity wards, ongoing education of the MCH-staff about communication
   skills, ethics and teaching methods, dialogue with decision makers on
   all levels in the society about MCH including family planning, ongoing
   training and support of community midwives (dayas) in the community by
   local MCH-staff, adequate supplies, inexpensive services, incentive
   money for the competent staff members are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Background: When empathy was presented in a lecture, medical students
   did not appreciate the topic or have opportunities to practice empathic
   techniques. The Patient Navigator Project was designed to foster
   understanding of a patient's experiences and encourage empathic
   communication.
   Methods: The project uses experiential learning in an outpatient setting
   in the first year of training. Each student was to ``shadow{''} a
   patient during a visit to a surgical oncologist and could observe the
   patient throughout treatment. Patient consent was obtained. Assignments
   were made before the appointments. Afterward, students met in small
   groups to reflect on their experiences.
   Results: Patients were willing to let medical students observe their
   care. Most students reported a positive learning experience and that
   they learned to see patients as people. not as numbers or diseases.
   Conclusions: Requiring individualized patient-centered activities in the
   preclinical curriculum is challenging owing to the large number of
   students and the unpredictable nature of patients. (C) 2002 Excerpta

Abstract = {{Context Empathy is a major component of a satisfactory doctor-patient
   relationship and the cultivation of empathy is a learning objective
   proposed by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) for all
   American medical schools. Therefore, it is important to address the
   measurement of empathy, its development and its correlates in medical
   schools.
   Objectives We designed this study to test two hypotheses: firstly, that
   medical students with higher empathy scores would obtain higher ratings
   of clinical competence in core clinical clerkships; and secondly, that
   women would obtain higher empathy scores than men.
   Materials and subjects A 20-item empathy scale developed by the authors
   (Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy ) was completed by 371 third-year
   medical students (198 men, 173 women).
   Methods Associations between empathy scores and ratings of clinical
   competence in six core clerkships, gender, and performance on objective
   examinations were studied by using t -test, analysis of variance,
   chi-square and correlation coefficients.
   Results Both research hypotheses were confirmed. Empathy scores were
   associated with ratings of clinical competence and gender, but not with
   performance in objective examinations such as the Medical College
   Admission Test (MCAT), and Steps 1 and 2 of the US Medical Licensing
   Examinations (USMLE).
   Conclusions Empathy scores are associated with ratings of clinical
   competence and gender. The operational measure of empathy used in this
   study provides opportunities to further examine educational and clinical
   correlates of empathy, as well as stability and changes in empathy at
   different stages of undergraduate and graduate medical education.}},

Abstract = {{The decoding of the human genome offers great promise for the
   understanding and treatment of chronic human diseases at the last
   frontier. There is a widely recognised hazard that an exaggerated
   emphasis on molecular reductionism may lead to the loss of the essential
   humanitarian instincts of young doctors. To counteract this danger it is
   now accepted by many leading figures of the medical establishment that
   the undergraduate curriculum must evolve to incorporate a variety of
   subjects conventionally taught in the faculty of humanities at our great
   universities. In this article, the case is argued that the study of
   `medical humanities' will enhance the empathy, communication skills,
   ethical standing and, paradoxically, the scientific literacy of the next
   generation of young doctors. As a clinical scientist, I cannot prove
   these assertions with an evidence base, but offer up arguments as
   qualitative or hypothesis generation.}},

Title = {{Performance profiles: The influence of patient satisfaction data on
   physicians' practice}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{752-757}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Health maintenance organizations and other payers
   increasingly use patient satisfaction data to profile physician
   performance. Little is known about physicians' use of patient
   satisfaction information or how profiles affect individual physician
   behaviors. The objective of this study was to examine primary care
   physicians' perceptions of performance profiles based on patient
   satisfaction data, whether physicians use profiles to change practice
   behaviors, and which profile components physicians think are important
   for assessing quality of care.
   Methods. A written survey was conducted in 1998 in Massachusetts with
   810 primary care physicians (304 pediatricians, 201 family
   practitioners, 305 internists) who had at least 100 patients in a large
   managed care plan and had received 1 or more profiles based on patient
   satisfaction data. Physicians in training were excluded. Physicians'
   perceptions of profiles and their reported use to change practice
   behaviors were measured.
   Results. The response rate was 68\%. Twenty-three percent reported that
   profiles were very or extremely useful for improving care. Only 7\%
   reported using profiles often or always to change care. Although
   specific profile components related to interpersonal aspects of care
   were rated more useful, <11\% reported using profiles often or always to
   make changes on any individual component. A majority, 67\% to 89\%,
   reported making no or minor changes on profile components. Responses did
   not vary by specialty, demographics, or practice characteristics.
   Physicians rated interpersonal factors (eg, ability to communicate with
   patients, ability to show caring and empathy) as the most important
   indicators of quality of care; they report having the most control over
   these factors. Office factors (eg, staying on schedule, ease of
   scheduling appointments) were ranked as least important for assessing
   quality of care.
   Conclusion. Although health maintenance organizations and other payers
   increasingly use patient satisfaction reports to profile individual
   physicians and guide physician compensation and health plan
   participation, <25\% of primary care physicians find profiles useful for
   improving patient care and even fewer report using profiles to change
   practice. Profiles likely have limited influence on behavior changes.
   Payers who invest in profiles may find it advantageous to focus on
   health plans and practice facilities rather than on individual
   physicians.}},

Abstract = {{To explore how primary care clinician-teachers actually attempt to
   convey empathy to medical students and residents, the author carried out
   a qualitative study in 19992000 in which 12 primary care physicians
   reflected on their views of empathy, how they demonstrated empathy to
   patients, and how they went about teaching empathy to learners.
   Interview data were triangulated with observations of actual teaching
   sessions and informal questioning of students and residents who had been
   taught by the faculty participants. Grounded theory was used to
   interpret the data.
   The faculty had clear conceptualizations of what empathy meant in
   clinical practice, but differed as to whether it was primarily a
   measurable, behavioral skill or a global attitude. Respondents stressed
   the centrality of role modeling in teaching, and most used debriefing
   strategies, as well as both learner- and patient-centered approaches, in
   instructing learners about empathy. Findings suggest that limiting the
   teaching of empathy to a skill-based approach does not reflect the
   richness of what actually occurs in the clinical setting, and that it is
   important to teach empathy comprehensively, acknowledging both
   behavioral and attitudinal tools.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose : To measure the psychosocial attitudes and beliefs of
   physicians working within oncology in the United Kingdom and to examine
   whether beliefs alter after communication skills training. Additionally,
   to investigate whether physicians' attitudes are reflected in
   communication behaviors with patients during interviews.
   Methods: Ninety-three physicians completed a 32-item Physician
   Psychosocial Belief (PPSB) questionnaire at baseline (T1) before
   randomization to attendance at a 3-day residential communication skills
   course (n = 48) or a control group (n = 45). Three months later (T2),
   both groups completed another PPSB and a self-assessment questionnaire
   recording perceived changes in communication with patients. At both time
   points, physicians' consultations with two consenting patients were
   videotaped. Communication behaviors were measured using the Medical
   Interaction Processing System.
   Results : Physicians who attended the course showed significantly
   improved attitudes and beliefs toward psychosocial issues compared with
   controls (P = .002). This improvement was reflected in the analysis of
   the videotaped recordings of their communication behaviors with
   patients. Expressions of empathy were more likely for the course group
   at T2 than the controls (P = .02), as were open questions (P = .001),
   appropriate responses to patient cues (P = .005), and psychosocial
   probing (P = .041). These objective findings were supported by
   physicians' self report of changes in communication style during
   interviews with patients.
   Conclusion: Our results show that a communication skills training
   intervention using behavioral, cognitive, and affective components not
   only increases potentially beneficial and more effective interviewing
   styles but can also alter attitudes and beliefs, thus increasing the
   likelihood that such skills will be used in the clinical setting. (C)

Abstract = {{Ecstasy is a recreational drug that is increasing in popularity,
   particularly in young adolescents. Its appeal involves its euphoric
   effects and a feeling of empathy for others (hence the nickname ``hug

   perception of safety. Cases of adverse effects, toxic reactions, and
   fatalities are increasingly being reported in the medical literature, as
   well as in the popular press. Adverse effects include hyperthermia,
   seizures, cardiac abnormalities, and hyponatremia. Long-term Ecstasy use
   may result in serotonin terminal degeneration and depletion, which may
   result in psychiatric and cognitive sequelae. Controversy surrounds the
   legalization of Ecstasy for medicinal purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The effective practice of medicine requires narrative competence, that
   is, the ability to acknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the
   stories and plights of others. Medicine practiced with narrative
   competence, called narrative medicine, is proposed as a model for humane
   and effective medical practice. Adopting methods such as close reading
   of literature and reflective writing allows narrative medicine to
   examine and illuminate 4 of medicine's central narrative situations:
   physician and patient, physician and self, physician and colleagues, and
   physicians and society. With narrative competence, physicians can reach
   and join their patients in illness, recognize their own personal
   journeys through medicine, acknowledge kinship with and duties toward
   other health care professionals, and inaugurate consequential discourse
   with the public about health care. By bridging the divides that separate
   physicians from patients, themselves, colleagues, and society, narrative
   medicine offers fresh opportunities for respectful, empathic, and
   nourishing medical care.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of this study is to understand in depth the
   experience of the family physician faced with the patient that he
   perceives as `difficult'. This was done by means of the `long interview'
   as a method of qualitative research.
   Method. We interviewed 15 randomly selected Board-certified family
   physicians, with five or more years experience as specialists, employed
   in the northern district of the `Clalit Health Services', the major sick
   fund in Israel.
   Results. The participants stated that the `difficult' patients are not
   those with difficult medical problems but rather those who are violent,
   demanding, aggressive, rude and who seek secondary gain. Patients with
   multiple non-specific complaints and those with psychosomatic problems
   are also difficult for the family physician. Appropriate use of
   patient-doctor communication skills and an effort to improve relations
   with the patient through empathy, tolerance and non-judgmental listening
   were suggested by the physicians as ways of making the difficult
   encounter easier.
   Conclusions. Family physicians acknowledge their responsibility for the
   `difficult' patient, and seek innovative and creative ways to cope with
   the difficult medical encounter. The more experienced the doctor is, the
   less he perceives patients as `difficult', as he learns to accept
   greater diversity of behaviours in his patients.}},

Abstract = {{Low compliance to prescribed medical interventions is an ever present
   and complex problem, especially for patients with a chronic illness.
   With increasing numbers of medications shown to do more good than harm
   when taken as prescibed, low compliance is a major problem in health
   care. Relevant studies were retrieved through comprehensive searches of
   different database systems to enable a thorough assessment of the major
   issues in compliance to prescribed medical interventions. The term
   compliance is the main term used in this review because the majority of
   papers reviewed used this term.
   Three decades have passed since the first workshop on compliance
   research. It is timely to pause and to reflect on the accumulated
   knowledge. The enormous amount of quantitative research undertaken is of
   variable methodological quality, with no gold standard for the
   measurement of compliance and it is often not clear which type of
   non-compliance is being studied. Many authors do not even feel the need
   to define adherence. Often absent in the research on compliance is the
   patient, although the concordance model points at the importance of the
   patient's agreement and harmony in the doctor-patient relationship.
   The backbone of the concordance model is the patient as a decision maker
   and a cornerstone is professional empathy. Recently, some qualitative
   research has identified important issues such as the quality of the
   doctor-patient relationship and patient health beliefs in this context.
   Because non-compliance remains a major health problem, more high quality
   studies are needed to assess these aspects and systematic
   reviews/meta-analyses are required to study the effects of compliance in
   enhancing the effects of interventions.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify the preferences and concerns of seriously III
   patients about discussing religious and spiritual beliefs with
   physicians.
   DESIGN. Three focus group discussions with patients who had experienced
   a recent life-threatening illness. Discussions were audiotaped,
   transcribed verbatim, and reviewed independently by two investigators to
   identify discrete comments for grouping into domains. A third
   investigator adjudicated differences in opinion. Comments were then
   independently reviewed for relevance and consistency by a health
   services researcher and a pastoral counselor. SETTING: Academic medical
   center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Referred sample of 22 patients hospitalized with a recent
   life-threatening illness.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Almost all of the 562 comments could be
   grouped into one of five broad domains: 1) religiosity/spirituality, 2)
   prayer, 3) patient-physician relationship, 4) religious/spiritual
   conversations, and 5) recommendations to physicians. God, prayer, and
   spiritual beliefs were often mentioned as sources of comfort, support,
   and healing. All participants stressed the importance of physician
   empathy. Willingness to participate in spiritual discussions with
   doctors was closely tied to the patient-physician relationship. Although
   divided on the proper context, patients agreed that physicians must have
   strong interpersonal skills for discussions to be fruitful.
   Physician-initiated conversation without a strong patient-physician
   relationship was viewed as inappropriate and as implying a poor
   prognosis.
   CONCLUSION: Religion and spirituality are a source of comfort for many
   patients. Although not necessarily expecting physicians to discuss
   spirituality, patients want physicians to ask about coping and support
   mechanisms. This exploratory study suggests that if patients then
   disclose the importance of spiritual: beliefs In their lives, they would
   like physicians to respect these values.}},

Abstract = {{We qualitatively examined themes covered in a creative writing elective
   designed to enhance pre-clinical medical students' writing, observation,
   and reflection skills relative to experiences in their medical
   education. Qualitative analysis of writings' themes was carried out via
   iterative consensus building process and validated through member checks
   and literature review. Fourteen students completed the elective, seven
   for each year it was given. Students submitted 86 written pieces.
   Qualitative analysis demonstrated the presence of nine themes: students'
   role confusion, developing a professional identity, medicine as a
   calling, physician privilege and power, humanizing the teacher, the
   limits of medicine, death and dying, anticipating future challenges, and
   identification with the patient. Students evaluated this creative
   writing course favorably, indicating value in writing and reflection.
   Themes covered are of concern to second-year medical students as well as
   other trainees and practicing physicians. Writing may aid in the
   professional development of physicians. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The expression of emotion and the sharing of information are determined
   by cultural factors, consultation time, and the structure of the health
   care system. Two emblematic situations in Spain - the expression of
   aggression in the patient-physician encounter, and the withholding of
   diagnostic information from the patient - have not been well-described
   in their sociocultural context. To explore these, the authors observed
   and participated in clinical practice and teaching in several settings
   throughout Spain and analyzed field notes using qualitative methods. In
   this paper, we explore three central constructs - modesty (pudor),
   dignity (honor), and authority (autoridad) - and their expressions in
   patient-physician encounters. We define two types of emotions in
   clinical settings - public, extroverted expressions of anger and
   exuberance, and private, deeply held feelings of fear and grief that
   tend to be expressed through the arts and religion. Premature
   reassurance and withholding of information are interpreted as attempts
   to reconstruct the honor and pudor of the patient. Physician authority
   and perceived loyalty to the government-run health care system generate
   conflict and aggression in the patient-physician relationship. These
   clinical behaviors are contextualized within cultural definitions of
   effective communication, an ideal patient-physician relationship, the
   role of the family, and ethical behavior. Despite agreement on the goals
   of medicine, the behavioral manifestations of empathy and caring in
   Spain contrast substantially with northern European and North American
   cultures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of antimicrobial agents, there has been an
   association between antibiotic use and the development of antimicrobial
   resistance. Antibiotic therapy eradicates not only pathogenic organisms
   but also the protective normal flora. This so-called ``selective
   pressure{''} results in colonization with bacteria that are resistant to
   the original therapy. The result has been an increase over the past two
   decades in antibiotic resistance among common bacteria{[} causes of
   outpatient infections. Several studies have demonstrated that a
   substantial portion of the antibiotics prescribed in the outpatient
   setting are given for viral illnesses or bacterial diseases where the
   benefit of antibacterial therapy is marginal. The reasons for
   prescribing antibiotics in these situations are related to medical and
   social factors. Physicians should be familiar with the clinical
   situations in which they should provide antibiotics and those in which
   they may safely be withheld. Physicians should understand the
   motivations of patients who are seeking antibiotics and provide
   education, empathy and alternative treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The standardized patient (SP) examination is used in a majority of
   medical schools to test clinical skills. This examination usually yields
   both numerical ratings of clinical skill and narrative comments by
   patients or observers, yet most empirical studies of SP assessment focus
   on the numerical ratings only. This quantitative focus can lead to a
   narrow conceptualization of the nature and development of clinical
   competence. The authors suggest that in addition to utilizing SP
   numerical ratings, medical educators also use the rich qualitative
   material produced in the SP examination (e.g., patient comments,
   videotapes of the examination) to explore students' development of
   clinical competence, which involves the purposive integration of basic
   science, technical skill, empathy, communication, professional role, and
   personal history.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To determine senior residents' views on the meaning of
   professionalism and how they learned about it.
   Method. By means of a modified Dillman technique, all senior residents
   at two faculties of medicine (n = 533) were surveyed about
   professionalism during the 1998-99 academic year. The residents were
   asked to list attributes of professionalism and to rank methods they
   found most useful for learning about professionalism, to rate the
   adequacy and quality of their teaching about professionalism and their
   comfort in explaining the concert of professionalism to a more junior
   trainee, to list suggestions about how teaching about professionalism
   could be improved, and to name the medical organization most concerned
   with matters of professionalism
   Results. A total of 258 residents (48.4\%) responded. They listed 1,052
   attributes they associated with professionalism. The three most common
   attributes, all listed by more than 100 respondents, were respect,
   competence, and empathy. The respondents had learned the most about
   professionalism from observing role models, they rated the quantity and
   quality of teaching about it positively, and they felt comfortable
   explaining professionalism to a junior resident. Only 56\% of the
   residents correctly identified the Canadian medical organization most
   concerned with professionalism.
   Conclusion. Residents' knowledge about professionalism reflects their
   early stage of development as physicians and their daily activities,
   where such aspects of proiessionalism as the social contract, codes of
   ethics, participation in professional societies, and altruism are not
   highlighted. Residency programs should develop teaching activities
   focusing on professionalism that: relate to issues residents face in
   their daily work.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{598-605}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{North American physicians emerge from their medical training with a wide
   array of professional beliefs and values. Many are thoughtful and
   introspective. Many are devoted to patients' welfare. Some bring to
   their work a broad view of social responsibility. Nonetheless, the
   authors contend that North American medical education favors an explicit
   commitment to traditional values of doctoring-empathy, compassion, and
   altruism among them -and a tacit commitment to behaviors grounded in an
   ethic of detachment, self-interest, and objectivity.
   They further note that medical students and young physicians respond to
   this conflict in various ways. Some re-conceptualize themselves
   primarily as technicians and narrow their professional identities to an
   ethic of competence, thus adopting the tacit values and discarding the
   explicit professionalism. Others develop non-reflective professionalism,
   an implicit avowal that they best care for their patients by treating
   them as objects of technical services (medical care).
   Another group appears to be ``immunized{''} against the tacit values,
   and thus they internalize and develop professional virtue. Certain
   personal characteristics of the student, such as gender, belief system,
   and non-medical commitments, probably play rules in ``immunization,{''}
   as do medical school features such as family medicine, communication
   skills courses, medical ethics, humanities, and social issues in
   medicine. To be effective, though, these features must be prominent and
   tightly integrated into the medical school curriculum.
   The locus of change in the culture of medicine has now shifted to
   ambulatory settings and the marketplace. It remains to be seen whether
   this move will lessen the disjunction between the explicit curriculum
   and the manifestly contradictory values of detachment and entitlement,
   and the belief that the patient's interest always coincides with the
   physician's interest.}},

Abstract = {{The growing abundance of highly immunogenic vaccines has arrived with a
   burden of pain, distress, and common adverse reactions that in turn may
   interfere with parental compliance and aggravate anti-vaccine sentiment.
   In a study of 150 children in each of 2 age-groups, we found that
   approximately 20\% of the subjects suffered serious distress or worse.
   During the procedural phase, approximately 90\% of the 15-to-18 month
   old children and 45\% of the 4-to-6 year old children showed serious
   distress or worse. To address non-adherence with pediatric vaccine
   schedules, we must consider all of the possible issues that might
   prevent a parent from taking a child to a health care provider for
   vaccination. In that same study we identified useful predictors for both
   preparatory and procedural distress - predictors that might be used in
   identifying children who might benefit from preventive interventions.
   Vaccine providers might consider a variety of interventions. Attitude,
   empathy, instruction. and practice have all been shown to have a
   salutatory effect upon pain and anxiety with medical procedures in
   general and specifically with vaccinations. Distraction has also been
   found to be an effective method for distress and pain prevention in
   children. More formal methods of clinical hypnosis which combine a deep
   state of relaxation with focused imagery and suggestion have also been
   found to be effective in helping children and adolescents prepare for,
   cope with, and tolerate the pain and anxiety associated with medical
   procedures. So-called `sugar nipples' delivering small amounts of
   sucrose orally at the time of a painful procedure in an infant has been
   not been shown to decrease vaccination pain and studies on refrigerant
   topical anesthetics are mixed. Studies have found a eutectic mixture of
   2.5\% lidocaine and 2.5\% prilocaine (EMLA) effective in providing
   adequate local anesthesia in children, but it suffers from problems in
   practical application. Studies with various injection techniques have
   not identified ready solutions, and although jet injection appears to
   provoke less anxiety and cause less immediate pain, studies also
   indicate a somewhat greater incidence of delayed local reactogenicity
   including soreness and edema. Other measures to prevent or rapidly treat
   other common adverse events have been shown effective and should be
   considered as well. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present review is aimed at providing an overview of the assessment
   process. The mode of assessment has a powerful influence on the learning
   behaviour of students. It is therefore important to ensure that there is
   congruity between the objective, the task and the test. In other words:
   define it, teach it, examine it. It is difficult to evaluate many of the
   attributes that we desire in a doctor; and examples of this include
   empathy, ethical behaviour, problem-solving skills, ability to
   self-educate and teamwork. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that it
   is better to measure uncertainly the significant than to measure
   reliably and validly the trivial. Furthermore different methods of
   assessment suit different educational objectives (fitness for purpose)
   and this supports the use of multiple assessment techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Patient satisfaction is an important part and a measure of
   the quality of health care. Patient satisfaction with family physicians
   was studied within the project `Analysis of Transition of Health Care
   System in Croatia'.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to explore patient satisfaction
   with family physicians through evaluation of some characteristics of
   physician behaviour. The specific goals of this study were to determine
   whether there were differences in the evaluation of patient satisfaction
   with physician behaviour with regard to some sociodemographic
   characteristics of the respondents.
   Methods. The study group consisted of 1217 respondents: 479 (39.4\%) men
   and 738 (60.6\%) women. Medical students interviewed the respondents
   `face-to-face' immediately after their consultation with the physician.
   An anonymous questionnaire was created providing answers to 10 questions
   on patient satisfaction. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and
   the reason for encounter of the respondents were also collected.
   Results. The average positive rating over 10 questions on patient
   satisfaction was 85.3\%. There was a statistically significant
   difference in age distribution between geographic areas (P < 0.001).
   Differences in answers were found regarding sex, age, educational level
   (P < 0.001) and reason for encounter (P < 0.01). Two factors were
   obtained by factor analysis: the fi rst could be called physician's
   competence/expertise estimated by respondents, and the other physician's
   empathy evaluated by respondents. The respondents were divided into two
   groups based on the reason for encounter as a criterion for discriminant
   analysis: acute (symptoms and complaints, injuries; n = 553) and other
   reasons (n = 664). The discriminant function obtained was statistically
   significant (P < 0.01). Younger respondents, regardless of sex, whose
   reason for encounter was an acute condition, were less satisfied with
   the physician's expertise, agreeableness during the consultation,
   physician's interest in what they were saying and physician's
   friendliness.
   Conclusion. Considering the difficulties present in the health systems
   of countries in transition, the results of our study were surprisingly
   encouraging, showing that the respondents were satisfied with the
   physician's behaviour and that the physicians fulfilled the basic
   elements of professional behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the prematurity stereotype was extended by randomly
   assigning 158 Israeli medical and nursing students to view full-term
   infants labelled either `full-term' (FTL) or `premature' (PL). One-half
   of the students were additionally assigned to a goal condition in which
   they were informed that their judgements would be evaluated for their
   accuracy. Overall, students were found to show strong stereotyping
   effects, rating PL infants more negatively than FTL infants when asked
   questions about their expectations for the infants' growth and
   development as well as their expectations for how mothers of these
   infants might behave during a medically related contact concerning her
   infant. However, the content of the stereotype varied across type of
   health care provider when general perceptions of the infants' status
   characteristics were elicited, with pre-clinical medical students
   showing greater levels of stereotyping than upper level students. Only
   limited effects involving the goal condition were found. When
   communicating with mothers, upper level students reported that they
   would respond more time-expediently and pre-clinical students reported
   that they would show more empathy. The findings emphasize the important
   role stereotypes play in interpersonal processes, including
   caregiver-patient interactions. Implications for medical education and
   practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Successful management of chronic pain in older people is dependent on a
   careful history and physical examination as it is in young adults.
   However, detailed attention must also be paid to the effects of
   co-morbidity on the pain and its treatment, on communication strategies
   with patients who often have sight and hearing impediments, and on the
   feasible range of functional outcomes for each patient. Drug
   interactions are common in older people as they take more medications
   and have reduced ability to clear most analgesic and adjuvant
   medications. This suggests a larger than usual role for
   non-pharmacological management strategies. However, simple analgesics
   and narcotics are safe to use in older people without overt liver and
   renal disease, providing the lowest dose compatible with functional
   improvement is sought; the goal of therapy is to maintain optimum
   function rather than cure the pain. In general the outcome is positive
   for both the patient and the practitioner as patients usually respond to
   medical, physical, psychosocial and cognitive behavioural programmes as
   well as young adults if given an appropriate milieu, adequate time and
   empathy. (C) 2001 European Federation of Chapters of the International

Abstract = {{We summarize our 15 years of educational experience in the field of
   teaching microsurgery. The students can be divided into three groups:
   (1) medical students, (2) researchers, (3) medical doctors and
   specialists. Characteristics of our method include the following:
   activity, synchronism, video-assistance, self-controlling,
   individualization, analysis. The Furka microsurgical educational method,
   named after one of the authors, is 20 hours long (five 4-hour sessions).
   The first lesson allows students to become acquainted with the
   microsurgical instruments. The next lesson consists of learning the
   probe of layer-feeling. The third lesson is to learn how to produce
   stitches under the microscope. The fourth lesson includes arterial
   anastomosis preparation on fresh arterial pieces of animal origin. The
   fifth lesson means a quality change from previous classes, as practice
   is performed on living animals, generally rats. The teaching of
   microsurgical basics requires both patience and empathy. The teaching
   process is most successful if one teacher deals with a maximum of two
   students. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss.}},

Abstract = {{Aim-To investigate whether attitudes to parenting were altered in final
   year medical students following a period spent caring for a simulated
   infant.
   Methods-Seventy medical students during their paediatric attachment in
   the final year completed a questionnaire regarding personal childcare
   attitudes. Students attached to a teaching hospital were allocated a 24
   hour time period to care for ((Baby Think It Over{''} (BTIO), a
   computerised doll that simulates a 6 week old infant and records care
   given. The students then completed a second questionnaire assessing the
   impact of the experience.
   Results-Forty nine per cent of students thought their advice regarding
   sick children was less valid than if they had their own children; 96\%
   of students believed their approach to parents caring for young infants
   could be improved by caring for a 6 week old infant. All the students
   felt their lifestyle would be affected. Following the BTIO care period,
   79\% considered the experience straightforward, with 35\% expressing a
   little more empathy and 15\% a lot more empathy for parents as a result.
   Thoughts regarding impact on lifestyle were unaltered. Caring for BTIO,
   however, was not considered to be a realistic experience and overall not
   particularly useful.
   Conclusion-Simulated infants are of only limited value in increasing
   medical student understanding of parental concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction General practice trainers hold a key position in general
   practice training, especially through their provision of a role model.
   Their own competence in general practice care is important in this
   regard. The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether a quality
   assessment programme could identify the strengths and weaknesses of GP
   trainers in four main domains of general practice care.
   Methods The quality assessment programme comprised validated tests on
   four domains of general practice: general medical knowledge, knowledge
   of medical-technical skills, consultation skills and practice
   management. The criterion for the identification of relative strengths,
   and weaknesses of GP trainers was a variation in the scores of trainers
   indicating higher and lower scores (strengths and weaknesses) within
   each domain.
   Results GP trainers (n = 105) were invited to participate in the study
   and 90\% (n = 94) did so. The variation in scores allowed the indication
   of strengths and weaknesses. Main strengths were: general medical
   knowledge of the digestive system; knowledge of medical skills relating
   to the skin; consultation skills concerning empathy; practice management
   with regard to accessibility. Main weaknesses were: general medical
   knowledge of the neurological system; knowledge of the medical/technical
   skills relating to the endocrine metabolic and nutritional system;
   consultation skills regarding shared decision making; practice
   management involving cooperation with staff and other care providers.
   Discussion This first systematic evaluation of GP trainers identified
   their strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses identified will be used
   in the improvement process as topics for collective improvement in the
   GP trainers' general curriculum and in individual learning plans.}},

Title = {{Care to underserved children: Residents' attitudes and experiences}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine: 1) the relationship between residents' responses
   toward caring for underserved children and families during residency and
   their perceptions of their continuity clinic experience; and 2) which
   characteristics are related to continuing to care for the underserved
   after completion of training.
   Design. Cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Methods. A 49-item questionnaire was mailed to 210 third-year pediatric
   residents at 12 urban training programs in the Northeast in May 1995.
   Information was collected about residents' emotional responses toward
   caring for underserved families, their assessments of clinic operations,
   their sense of effectiveness in caring for underserved patients in
   continuity clinic, preresidency experiences with the underserved, and
   their intent to care for the underserved after training.
   Results. Of 210 surveys mailed, 71\% were returned. Thirty-six percent
   of residents planned to pursue a career in primary care, 53\% did not,
   and 11\% did not answer or were planning a year as chief resident.
   Fifty-seven percent of all residents planned to devote a portion of
   their practice toward caring for the underserved after training.
   Residents whose emotional responses toward caring for the underserved
   included: 1) not worrying that they had become numb to children's
   psychosocial difficulties, 2) not feeling angry with how families cared
   for their children, and 3) feeling more empathy with the underserved had
   significantly higher mean scores on both their assessment of clinic
   operations and their sense of effectiveness. The only demographic
   characteristic associated with a greater sense of effectiveness was
   being black.
   To better characterize which residents planned to care for the
   underserved after training, we examined a subsample of 46 residents who
   recalled an interest in caring for the underserved during residency
   training and who were pursuing a career in primary care. Residents that
   did not recall an interest in caring for the underserved at the onset of
   residency training were unlikely to have plans to care for the
   underserved after the completion of training. Within this group
   residents who planned to care for the underserved after training
   differed significantly from residents who did not plan to continue this
   work by feeling a greater sense of effectiveness in clinic, feeling less
   worried about becoming numb, and having greater empathy for underserved
   families.
   Conclusions. There are a number of identifiable emotional responses
   residents develop toward caring for the underserved that relate to their
   perceptions of continuity clinic and whether a resident chooses to
   continue to care for the underserved after training.}},

Abstract = {{Reflexivity as a strategy in general practice can be used to implement a
   patient-centred approach in the consultation. General practice has long
   represented a tradition attempting to integrate both illness and
   disease. For the GP, it is natural to focus on the patient's whole
   situation, and the GP's experience with patients is often based on a
   long-term relationship. Reflexivity implies having a self-conscious
   account of the production of knowledge as it is being produced. We
   believe that GPs can gain access to additional knowledge by consciously
   using reflexivity as a strategy in the consultation. In the present
   article, we discuss reflexivity in relation to the notions of empathy,
   personal experience and self-knowledge. By using reflexivity in order to
   rely on personal experience, the GP can gain access to patients'
   understanding of their health. Reflexivity can be a valuable concept for
   the GP in patient-centred medicine and can contribute to bridging the
   gap between the patient's perspective and the doctor's understanding of
   the patient's health.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To explore the contribution patients can make to medical education
   from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, to describe a
   framework for reviewing and monitoring patient involvement in specific
   educational situations and to generate suggestions for further research.
   Methods Literature review.
   Results Direct contact with patients can be seen to play a crucial role
   in the development of clinical reasoning, communication skills,
   professional attitudes and empathy. It also motivates through promoting
   relevance and providing context. Few studies have explored this area,
   including effects on the patients themselves, although there are
   examples of good practice in promoting more active participation.
   Conclusion The Cambridge framework is a tool for evaluating the
   involvement of patients in the educational process, which could be used
   by curriculum planners and teachers to review and monitor the extent to
   which patients are actively involved. Areas for further research include
   looking at the `added value' of using real, as opposed to simulated,
   patients; more work on outcomes for patients (other than satisfaction);
   the role of real patients in assessment; and the strengths and
   weaknesses of different models of patient involvement.}},

Abstract = {{Context Patients often present clues (direct or indirect comments about
   personal aspects of their lives or their emotions) during conversations
   with their physicians. These clues represent opportunities for
   physicians to demonstrate understanding and empathy and thus, to deepen
   the therapeutic alliance that is at the heart of clinical care. A
   paucity of information exists regarding how physicians address the
   psychological and social concerns of patients.
   Objectives To assess how patients present clues and how physicians
   respond to these clues in routine primary care and surgical settings.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Descriptive, qualitative study of 116
   randomly selected routine office visits to 54 primary care physicians
   and 62 surgeons in community-based practices in Oregon and Colorado,
   audiotaped and transcribed in 1994.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of presentation of clues by patients
   during office visits, nature (emotional vs social) and content of clues,
   and nature of physician responses to clues, coded as positive or missed
   opportunity.
   Results Fifty-two percent and 53\% of the visits in primary care and
   surgery, respectively, included 1 or more clues. During visits with
   clues, the mean number of clues per visit was 2.6 in primary care and
   1.9 in surgery. Patients initiated approximately 70\% of clues, and
   physicians initiated 30\%. Seventy-six percent of patient-initiated
   clues in primary care settings and 60\% in surgical settings were
   emotional in nature. In surgery, 70\% of emotional clues related to
   patients' feelings about their biomedical condition, while in primary
   care, emotional clues more often related to psychological or social
   concerns (80\%) in patients' lives. Physicians responded positively to
   patient emotions in 38\% of cases in surgery and 21\% in primary care,
   but more frequently they missed opportunities to adequately acknowledge
   patients' feelings. Visits with missed opportunities tended to be longer
   than visits with a positive response.
   Conclusion This study suggests that physicians in both primary care and
   surgery can improve their ability to respond to patient clues even in
   the context of their busy clinical practices.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To review systematically clinical studies providing empirical
   data on stress-management programs in medical training.
   Method. The authors searched Medline and PSYCHINFO from 1966 to 1999.
   Studies were included if they evaluated stress-management programs for
   medical trainees (medical students, interns, or residents); reported
   empirical data; and had been conducted at allopathic medical schools.
   Results. Although the search yielded over 600 articles discussing the
   importance of addressing the stress of medical education, only 24
   studies reported intervention programs, and only six of those used
   rigorous scientific method.
   Results revealed that: medical trainees participating in
   stress-management programs demonstrated (1) improved immunologic
   functioning, (2) decreases in depression and anxiety, (3) increased
   spirituality and empathy, (4) enhanced knowledge of alternative
   therapies for future referrals, (5) improved knowledge of the effects of
   stress, (6) greater use of positive coping skills, and (7) the ability
   to resolve role conflicts. Despite these promising results, the studies
   had many limitations.
   Conclusion. The following considerations should be incorporated into
   future research: (1) rigorous study design, including randomization and
   control (comparison) groups, (2) measurement of moderator variables to
   determine which intervention works best for wham, (3) specificity of
   outcome measures, and (4) follow up assessment, including effectiveness
   of future patient care.}},

Title = {{The doctor-patient relationship and HIV-infected patients' satisfaction

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which perceptions of specific aspects
   of the doctor-patient relationship are related to overall satisfaction
   with primary care physicians among HIV-infected patients.
   DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational study of HIV-infected persons new to
   primary HIV care. Data were collected at enrollment and approximately 6
   months later by in-person interview.
   SETTING: Two urban medical centers in the northeastern United States.
   PARTICIPANTS: Patients seeking primary HIV care for the first time.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was
   patient-reported satisfaction with a primary care physician measured 6
   months after initiating primary HIV care. Patients who were more
   comfortable discussing personal issues with their physicians (P = .021),
   who perceived their primary care physicians as more empathetic (P =
   .001), and who perceived their primary care physicians as more
   knowledgeable with respect to HIV (P = .002) were significantly more
   satisfied with their primary care physicians, adjusted for
   characteristics of the patient and characteristics of primary care.
   Collectively, specific aspects of the doctor-patient relationship
   explained 56\% of the variation in overall satisfaction with the primary
   care physician.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients' perceptions of their primary care physician's HIV
   knowledge and empathy were highly related to their satisfaction with
   this physician. Satisfaction among HIV-infected patients was not
   associated with patients' sociodemographic characteristics, HIV risk
   characteristics, alcohol and drug use, health status, quality of life,
   or concordant patient-physician gender and racial matching.}},

Abstract = {{Philosophers who studied moral development have found that individuals
   normally progress rapidly in early adulthood from a conventional stage
   in which they base behavior on the norms and values of those around them
   to a more principled stage where they identify and attempt to live by
   personal moral values. Available data suggest that many medical
   students, who should be in this transition, show little change in their
   moral development. Possibly, this relates to perceived pressures to
   conform to the informal culture of the medical wards. Many students
   experience considerable internal dissidence as they struggle to
   accommodate personal values related to empathy, care, and compassion to
   their clinical training. Educational interventions that positively
   influence this process have established regular opportunities for
   critical reflection by the students in small groups. Other interventions
   include faculty development to enhance role modeling and feedback by
   clinical faculty. The author espouses more widespread adoption of these
   educational interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Context Improved teamwork and greater collaboration between professions
   are important factors in effective health care. These goals may be
   achieved by including interprofessional learning in the undergraduate
   medical curriculum. The Faculty of Medicine at the University of
   Liverpool organized a pilot two-day multiprofessional course involving
   all the health care related disciplines.
   Objective The present study examined the perceived effect of the
   multiprofessional course on the work practice of these newly qualified
   health care professionals.
   Method The views of former students who took part in the pilot course
   were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule and analysed
   using a qualitative data analysis software package QSR (NUDIST)-D-star.
   Results Two main themes emerged. These centred around role knowledge and
   interprofessional attitudes. Data indicated that participants perceived
   the course to have increased their knowledge of the other professions
   and that this effect had persisted. Reported benefits to their working
   practice included facilitating appropriate referrals, increasing
   professional empathy and awareness of other professionals' skills,
   raising confidence and heightening awareness of the holistic nature of
   patient treatment. Participants reported forming negative attitudes
   towards other professions during their undergraduate education. They
   believed these had been partly encouraged by course tutors. The pilot
   course was perceived to have had had little effect on these attitudes.
   Changes occurred once the newly qualified professionals started work.
   Conclusions The results support the idea that interprofessional
   educational interventions must be tailored to specific learning goals to
   be implemented successfully, and that interprofessional education should
   be prolonged and widespread to have a real impact.}},

Abstract = {{Literature and medicine share an inherently enduring relationship.
   Doctors turn to literature-both its plots and its forms-to understand
   what occurs in their patients' lives, to increase their own narrative
   competence, to interpret accurately the texts of medicine, to develop
   empathy, and to deepen their capacities for reflection and
   self-knowledge. Together, these skills, attitudes, and bodies of
   knowledge contribute to the effective practice of medicine. Literature
   is now taught in almost three quarters of the medical schools in the
   United States. Different goals, agendas, and methods are appropriate at
   each developmental stage of a physician's training, from the premedical
   curriculum to the continuing education of a practicing physician. A
   vigorous and growing scholarship and body of experience is propelling
   the field of literature and medicine to understand all the more clearly
   how acts of reading and acts of writing might illuminate acts of
   doctoring.}},

Abstract = {{The development of palliative care as a recognizable specialty has been
   supported by an acknowledgment of palliative medicine as a discrete
   discipline within the medical profession. While the knowledge and skills
   required for training in palliative medicine are well defined, there are
   elements of the medical care of people at the end of life that are more
   difficult to outline. Nursing practitioners and academics in particular
   have made important contributions in defining caring as an entity, and
   published work in the field of nursing, bio-ethics and philosophy has
   encouraged an understanding of what caring is and how it is practised.
   However, it has rarely been addressed specifically in the medical
   literature. Undergraduate and postgraduate curricula outline some of the
   attitudes required to practise palliative medicine but the way in which
   doctors learn to care and indeed should care has not been clearly
   detailed. This paper reviews some of the literature pertinent to this
   aspect of palliative care, with particular reference to some of the
   elements that may influence how and why doctors learn to care in the way
   that they do in their practice of medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The role of the general practitioner (GP) has changed
   significantly over the past decade. This problem is compounded by
   growing concern over postgraduate attrition rates from medicine, with
   current estimates as high as 19\%.
   Aim. To define a comprehensive model of the competencies required for
   the job role of GP.
   Method. Three independent studies were conducted to define GP
   competencies including (1) critical incidents focus groups with GPs, (2)
   behavioural coding of GP-patient consultations, and (3) critical
   incidents interviews with patients. Study 1 was conducted with GPs (n =
   35) from the Trent region. Study 2 involved observation of GP-patient
   consultations (n = 33 consultations), and Study 3 was conducted with
   patients (n = 21), all from a Midlandsbased medical practice.
   Results. The data collected from the three studies provided strong
   evidence for a competency model comprising 11 categories with a summary
   of the associated behavioural descriptions. Example competencies
   included empathy and sensitivity, communication skills, clinical
   knowledge and expertise, conceptual thinking, and coping with pressure.
   Conclusions. Triangulation of results was achieved from three
   independent studies. The competencies derived imply that a greater
   account of personal attributes needs to be considered in recruitment and
   training, rather than focusing on academic and clinical competency
   alone. The model could be employed for future research in design of
   selection techniques for the role of GP.}},

Abstract = {{As in many other countries, in Bangladesh there is an increasing public
   dissatisfaction with the medical profession. In the observation of the
   researcher, this dissatisfaction is not due to the lack of clinical
   competence but dire to problems of communication. A qualitative survey
   was done to find out the extent to which the intern doctors display
   communication skills. The study, was conducted among 25 intern doctors
   of Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, Bangladesh by using three sets of
   research instruments. The results indicated that intern doctors were
   very poor in communicating with their patients during history-taking.
   The major incompetences observed in communication skills during
   history-taking were: exploring patients' psychosocial concerns,
   providing empathy, discussing patients' personal issues and beginning
   and ending interviews. Other deficit areas identified were lack of
   warmth towards the patient, failure to keep the patient to relevant
   matters and the use of poor question styles during history-taking. The
   identified areas of deficit in competences in the sample can help to
   derive a prioritized checklist to organize the course content of
   communication skills training for history-taking in Bangladesh.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Quality of clinical interview is a key issue both for
   patient satisfaction and for diagnostic efficiency. Its adequacy relates
   to better clinical diagnosis treatment plans and patient compliance.
   Aim: To measure the quality of interviews performed by medical students
   in three Chilean medical schools before receiving specific training on
   the subject and to compare the scores obtained after introductory
   courses on interview. Material and methods: The interviews were
   videotaped and then evaluated using an objective scale, that measures 33
   skills grouped in six areas: opening, problem exploration, non verbal
   facilitation, interpersonal, patient reaction and closing. The students
   were assigned to an experimental group that receive an interactive
   workshop with roleplays, vignettes and videotape feedback, and to a non
   intervention group that received the usual bedside training on medical
   interviews. Results: Both groups shared the same skill level before the
   training, with better scores on nonverbal, patient reaction and problem
   exploration, and worse ones on closing and interpersonal skills.
   Comparing pre and oast-test results, the overall score improved in the
   experimental group (from 33.2 to 38.3, p=0.002) and worsened among non
   intervened students. There were statistically significant changes for
   opening (p<0.002), problem exploration (p<0.05), non verbal facilitation
   (p<0.0001) and closing (p<0.0001). Conclusions: It is important to train
   students not only in specific knowledge contents but in the process of
   interview. This training should encourage the development of empathy and
   closing skills.}},

Abstract = {{The ethics of caring, though the subject of much recent discussion by
   philosophers, has hardly been applied to medical ethics and medical
   education. Based on receptivity (that is, empathy and compassion) toward
   and taking responsibility for other persons, the ethics of caring has
   particular relevance to medicine. Caring guides the physician always to
   remain the patient's advocate and to maintain the therapeutic
   relationship when dealing with and resolving ethical dilemmas. This
   article discusses the philosophy behind the ethics of caring and then
   explores three issues that arise within its context: receptivity, taking
   responsibility, and creating an educational environment that fosters
   caring.}},

Journal = {{CANCER NURSING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{20-31}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Patients with cancer seem to experience distress particularly in the
   First period after diagnosis, and are likely to develop an affective
   disorder in the first 2 to 3 months. Communicative behaviors of nurses
   seem to play an important role in meeting the cognitive and affective
   needs of patients with cancer. This review of the literature examines
   the communicative behaviors of nurses during care activities with
   patients who have cancer. The studies show that emphasis is placed on
   the affective side, in which facilitating behaviors such as empathy,
   touch, comforting, and supporting are considered essential in caring for
   patients with cancer. Unfortunately, further studies in this review
   demonstrate that communication in oncologic care is complicated by such
   emotionally laden issues as the consequences associated with the
   life-threatening character of the disease and the far-reaching
   consequences of the medical treatment. This results in barriers to
   effective communication between patients with cancer and nurses. It is
   important, therefore, that nurses working with patients who have cancer
   are provided both structurally and repeatedly with continuing education
   programs in communication. Finally most of the studies covered in this
   review have an explorative character. Future research in this area
   should pay attention to the use of controlled studies, large sample
   sizes, and observational instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study examined the extent to which physicians expressed
   empathy and positiveness to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients
   during primary care visits. Methods: Twenty-seven family practice and
   internal medicine resident physicians at the University of New Mexico
   Health Sciences Center were audiotaped in 1995 with 427 adult patients
   who were fluent in English or Spanish. The tapes were reviewed and
   organized to measure how frequently physicians expressed empathy and
   positiveness to patients. Results: Physicians expressed empathy at equal
   rates to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. When examining only
   Hispanic patients, physicians were significantly more likely to express
   empathy to patients who they knew better Physicians expressed
   positiveness to non-Hispanic white patients more often than to Hispanic
   patients. When examining only Hispanic patients, physicians were more
   likely to express positiveness to patients who they knew better who
   rated their health better and who were more educated. When examining
   only non-Hispanic white patients, physicians were more likely to express
   positiveness to older and male patients than to younger and female
   patients. Also, female and younger physicians were significantly more
   likely to express positiveness to non-Hispanic white patients than male
   and older physicians were. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that the
   resident physicians expressed empathy equally well to Hispanic and
   non-Hispanic white patients but that resident physicians need further
   training on how to express positiveness to patients from different
   ethnic backgrounds, especially Hispanic patients.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the outcome of communication skill teaching for entry-lever
   medical students: does knowledge of empathy increase?}},

Abstract = {{Background While the literature shows the clinical value for medical
   practitioners of skill in communicating with patients in an empathetic
   manner, objective evaluations of methods to teach empathy are few.
   Purposes This paper describes a method of teaching entry-level medical
   students the elements of effective communication with patients, in
   preparation for their first practical exercises. The paper focuses on
   how the outcomes of the teaching were evaluated with special attention
   to empathy.
   Methods Student evaluative ratings were collected after training, and
   students also completed a pencil-and-paper test of empathy, both before
   and after the training. While all data were anonymous, student pre- and
   post-training empathy scores could be compared to assess individual
   changes in knowledge of empathy after training.
   Results Most students (81\%) felt better prepared to interview after the
   training. The pencil-and-paper measure of empathy has good reliability,
   both internal (alpha 0.83 and 0.91) and inter-rater (kappa 0.96).
   Overall, students made significant gains in their ability to make
   empathetic responses, although some (30\%) showed no gains.
   Conclusions Further research is required to identify students who fail
   to acquire skill in expressing empathy after undergoing training, and to
   validate the pencil-and-paper measure of empathy against real-life
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{As our preoccupation with empathy grows, we cast about for means of
   inculcating it. Literature has been proposed as an enabling factor for

   Thus, sensitizing students and young physicians to the nuances of human

Abstract = {{Courses in medical ethics, bioethics, and other humanities subjects
   flourish in professional schools, yet a tension exists about whether
   their teaching goals should include trying to make students more humane
   and virtuous. some hold that these courses should help instill values
   and virtues professed by the medical community, such as fidelity,
   compassion, empathy, respect, and other qualities that will make
   students not only better professionals but also better and more humane
   people. Others reject this role, arguing that humanities courses should
   teach students the knowledge and skills to become better problem solvers
   regarding theoretical, moral, and social issues; they regard it to be
   counterproductive, presumptuous, or futile to try to make students
   better persons. The author examines the extent to which these views are
   incompatible, arguing that a cogent philosophy of education can be
   neither value-free nor fully independent of moral choices. Within
   limits, diverse approaches to incorporating values in teaching can be a
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits for both doctors and patients of effective communication
   skills in medical care have been widely documented(1,2) and are

   communication skills of dentists working in government clinics in Hang
   Kong. The patient-centred interview as used in medical care formed the
   basis for teaching communication skills in this workshop.(2,3) Objective
   and subjective measures of dentists' knowledge, attitude and skills
   related to the patient-centred interview were obtained before,
   immediately and eight weeks after the workshop. Objective measures
   showed immediate gains in knowledge. However, attitudes declined during
   the period of study. Subjective evaluations revealed improved
   communication skills eight weeks after the workshop and that the
   patient-centred interview was considered relevant to the practices of
   these dentists. Participants made specific reference to the concept of
   empathy as a means of promoting more effective communication between

Abstract = {{The Web empowers a diverse population of users and this is reflected in
   both the demography and interests of today's on-line communities. Many
   of these communities provide an essential social function by enabling
   people with medical or personal problems to discuss their concerns with
   others. Physicians can provide the facts, but other patients can tell
   you what it really feels like and what to expect next, in a way that
   only someone with personal experience can. A study of the messages from
   an on-line medical support group shows that empathy is an essential
   ingredient in participants' discussions. Better tools are needed to
   empower patients to help themselves by finding information and
   contacting other patients in bulletin board communities. Suggestions
   about the nature of these tools are discussed. In particular, supporting
   a balance between empathic and factual communication is stressed. (C)

Abstract = {{Those who suffer from eating disorders often carry the added burden of
   stigmatising attitudes from the lay public and the medical profession.
   These attitudes not only restrict the opportunities for effective
   treatment but also confer additional handicaps. To some extent,
   stigmatising beliefs are based on partial truths about these disorders,
   namely their dangerousness, their sometimes poor response to treatment,
   the sufferers' part in their maintenance, and difficulties in
   communication. This review explores the truth of these beliefs and
   suggests ways in which a more positive approach to the management of
   eating disorders might help to reduce the stigma. This includes empathy
   with the patient's predicament and an approach to treatment in which the

Abstract = {{Objectives The importance of professional attitudes in medical care has
   long been recognized; however, medical training has not stressed
   attitude development until recently. In previous studies among medical
   students, we found that gender and specialty preference are important
   factors in attitudes. In this study, patient-centredness of trainees in
   general practice and surgery and of final-year clerks preferring one of
   these specialties was assessed in one medical school in The Netherlands.
   The effect of gender, specialty and training level on attitude was
   investigated.
   Design In 1995, attitudes of 37 general practice trainees, 31 surgery
   trainees and 120 clerks were measured anonymously using questionnaires
   containing the Doctor-Patient Scale. This attitude scale measures
   patient-centredness vs, doctor-centredness. Response rates were 78\%,
   58\% and 84\%, respectively.
   Setting University of Utrecht.
   Subjects Medical students.
   Results Attitudes were related to specialty. General practice;trainees
   showed more patient-centredness than surgery trainees. In accordance
   with previous findings among younger students, no differences were found
   between final-year clerks and vocational trainees. In contrast to
   previous studies, gender was not related to patient-centredness.
   Conclusions Professional attitudes, in particular patient-centredness,
   seem to be related to specialty preference in the final year of graduate
   medical training and specialty as a career choice. It remains unclear
   whether professional socialization reinforces existing attitudes or
   whether existing attitudes result in specialty preference.}},

Abstract = {{It is time to understand the value of a broad liberal education for
   those college students who aim to be physicians, both because the
   medical curriculum is becoming more humanistic (which a liberal
   education would support) and because three enormous challenges confront
   physicians and educators alike: the relentless tide of biomedical
   discoveries, the great financial burden that medical care imposes, and
   the public's desperate plea for physicians who are more caring and
   communicative. A liberal education-meaning a course of study that is
   largely unrestricted and that attempts to sample the entire breadth of
   human knowledge-can help the premedical student cultivate, ripen, and
   enrich fundamental proficiencies such as accurate recording of
   observations, communicating ideas well, dealing with human emotions and
   becoming sensitive to human frailties, learning to listen and respond
   appropriately, learning to make sound judgments, and cultivating empathy
   and compassion. These are all skills that a liberal education can help
   the young student learn early rather than late, skills that prepare the
   student for dealing later with complex social, ethical, and clinical
   issues as a physician.
   A liberal education also can help prepare the student to take advantage
   of other general educational opportunities that are available in the
   small, closed community of a residency, such as learning to both assume
   and delegate responsibility, to participate in rational debate while
   respecting the opinions of others, and to exercise mature judgment,
   civility, empathy, and compassion.
   While a liberal education will not necesssarily make the student a more
   technically proficient doctor, for some it will be essential to awaken
   and sharpen those essential skills that a physician needs to rise to the
   top of a profession that never fails to recognize excellence and
   humanity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a psychometrically sound
   patient-satisfaction-with-physician questionnaire that can be used in an
   outpatient oncology setting.
   Patients and Methods: The questionnaire was developed by a four-step
   process involving a total of 277 cancer patients, The item-generation
   process utilized input from 95 oncology outpatients, three medical
   researchers, and the relevant literature. Items were tested by 70 of the
   above patients, Initial item reduction was achieved by input from
   another eight patients, Factor analysis and validity testing used data
   derived from a different group of 174 oncology outpatients, Convergent
   validity was tested by correlating the Princess Margaret Hospital
   Patient Satisfaction with Doctor Questionnaire (PMH/PSQ-MD) with Rubin
   et al's Physician subscale of the Patient's Viewpoint Questionnaire
   (PS-PVQ) and Smith et al's Patient-Doctor Interaction Scale (PDIS),
   Divergent validity was tested by comparing these questionnaires with
   Spitzer's quality of life (QOL) questionnaire.
   Results: The final PMH/PSQ-MD is a 29-item self-administered
   questionnaire with four response categories and a ``does not apply{''}
   category, Four domains were confirmed by factor analysis: (1)
   information exchange, (2) interpersonal skills, (3) empathy, and (4)
   quality of time. The questionnaire hers on overall Cronbach's alpha of
   0.97; the values for each domain are, respectively, 0.92, 0.90, 0.88,
   and 0.88, The PMH/PSQ-MD correlated well with both the PDIS and the
   PS-PVQ (P < .001 for both), Divergent validity was confirmed with
   Spitzer's QOL questionnaire.
   Conclusion: The PMH/PSQ-MD is an outpatient satisfaction questionnaire
   specific to the patient-physician interaction that has shown excellent
   internal consistency, is feasible, and has strong support for validity
   in this oncology population.

Abstract = {{Service-learning at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy
   began with the implementation of volunteer service opportunities which
   developed over three years into co-curricular service-learning. This
   report describes the development and integration of service-learning
   into the curriculum. Initially, a pharmacy faculty member established a
   relationship with care providers and administrators of two programs
   serving low-income communities, a summer camp for children in a housing
   project and a program providing free medical care to homeless and
   low-income patients. Pharmacy students participated in both projects;
   some volunteered while others formally registered for course credits.
   Survey results revealed that students perceived that the experience
   enhanced their AACP outcome competencies in the areas of clinical
   knowledge/skills, communication and interpersonal skills, empathy,
   professionalism, and social awareness. These results led to the
   implementation of an eight-hour/semester service requirement for
   second-year students in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. One hundred
   students completed this requirement for the Fall, 1997, and Spring,
   1998, semesters. During the 1998-99 academic year, changes were made to
   further integrate service-learning into the curriculum. First-year
   students were required to participate in eight hours of community
   service per month, and second-year students assisted pharmacists in free
   clinics serving homeless and low-income patients once per semester.
   Although service-learning demands the commitment of faculty time and
   resources, it is feasible and valuable to integrate service-learning
   into a PharmD curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Research conducted in primary care settings has demonstrated
   that effective communication enhances patient recall of information,
   compliance, satisfaction, psychologic well-being, and biomedical
   outcomes. However, surgeons face communication challenges that are
   unique to the surgical situation. This study provides the first
   description of routine communication Between community-practicing
   surgeons ann their patients.
   Methods. Audiotapes of 676 routine office visits with 29 general
   surgeons and 37 orthopedic surgeons were coded for structure and
   content. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data is supplemented by
   illustrative examples of dialog selected to represent typical patterns
   of communication.
   Results. The mean visit length was 13 minutes. Surgeons talked more than
   patients, with typical surgical cal consultations containing relatively
   high amounts of patient education and counseling. Consultations had a
   narrow biomedical focus with little discussion of the psychologic
   aspects of patient problems. The affective tone of visits was generally
   positive, with few instances of overt criticism or disagreement by
   either party. However, surgeons infrequently expressed empathy toward
   patients, and social conversation was brief.
   Conclusions. The study underscores the differences in Both the content
   and process of routine surgical visits compared with primary care
   visits. On the basis of this work, it seems particularly important for
   surgeons to develop skills that enhance patient education and
   counseling. Further research is needed to understand the influences of
   surgeons' communication on patient behavioral, psychologic, and
   biomedical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The STOP system generates personalised smoking-cessation letters, using
   as input responses to a smoking questionnaire. Generating personalised
   patient-information material is an area of growing interest to the
   medical community, since for many people changing health-related
   behaviour is the most effective possible medical intervention. While
   previous Ar systems that generated personalised patient-information
   material were primarily based on medical knowledge, STOP is largely
   based on knowledge of psychology, empathy, and readability. We believe
   such knowledge is essential in systems whose goal is to change people's
   behaviour or mental state; but there are many open questions about how
   this knowledge should be acquired, represented, and reasoned with.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{14-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives There has been little evaluation, by means other than
   cognitive variables, of medical school curricula that include
   problem-based learning (PBL). This study aimed to investigate whether
   medical students' affect tolerance, an important prerequisite of
   empathy, was influenced by individual courses.
   Design The study is pseudo-randomised and cross-sectional, using a test
   of affect tolerance in students in their first, sixth and eighth term of
   medical school, during which they were kept together as one group for
   their pre-clinical studies, but were subsequently separated during the
   clinical part and were sent to two different university hospitals that
   used different teaching methods.
   Subjects Medical students.
   Setting University of Lund Medical School, Sweden.
   Results After receiving a short course in communications skills
   training, students in the sixth term had significantly higher mean
   scores on the test than students in their first term. In the eighth
   term, which is the surgery term, the mean scores for students attending
   the PBL course were still as high as those for students in the sixth
   term, while students in the course using conventional pedagogical
   methods had significantly lower mean scores.
   Discussion Since the content of the courses was similar and the
   composition of the two groups also fairly similar, we attribute the
   difference to the differing teaching methods. In the PBL course, the
   students were given continued and integrated communication skills
   instruction, in which it was possible for them to learn strategies to
   counteract the development of rigid psychic defences, which constitute
   an obstacle to affect tolerance and empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Dialogue medicine is presented as the prime means of understanding
   patients' illnesses. It is a practical attitude especially aimed to
   assist or inspire patients to consider, see and manage their
   illness-demanding efforts to unwittingly suppress or disguise such
   self-reproaching thoughts as are worse to bear than the feeling of being
   afflicted with a disease. Along with diagnosing patients' perceived
   bodily disorders, doctors can choose to see them as persons whose
   ailments stand for efforts to manage their existence as communicative
   human beings. The core of the paper is an encounter between the author
   and a female patient which illuminates the usefulness of genuine
   dialogue in medical practice. The paper illustrates how the dialogical
   attitude helps patients to see and manage their difficult
   life-situations and how the doctor can be inspired to change and develop
   and improve his/her skills as a dialogue partner. Doctors' dialogical
   attitude in the encounter encompasses for example openness, empathy,
   sensitivity, courage, attentiveness and responsiveness, accompanied by
   concern, trust, respect, affection, appreciation and hope. The
   philosophical and theoretical foundations of the concept of dialogue
   medicine are sketched out and some practically significant traits are
   described. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of medical interview are to obtain diagnostic information, to
   obtain an empathetic communication with the patient, to educate him
   about his disease and to establish a personal link allowing a lasting
   relationship. We analyze some features of communication with patients.
   Individualized communication, recognizing his identity and personal
   aspects ``looking from the patient{''}. Context a shared but not
   mentioned value part of the world of emotions and ideas. An analog an
   digital language the Sol mer precise in words and the latter more
   diffuse, with gestures, not verbal. Coherence, as the similitude between
   what toe think feel and say. IS there is no coherence, communication is
   impaired. Emotions, always present, rending communication more valid and
   real. We need to recognize, express and respond to emotions. An
   emotionless patient becomes a distant and impersonal object, an ``it{''}
   When emotions are incorporated the patient Is a ``him{''} with whom I
   share and dialog. Empathy is all emotional comprehension, a personal
   bond. II improves relationships and creates links. Compassion is a
   variation of empathy that includes spiritual aspects aid values.
   Negative emotions as rage, frustration and aggression creates
   communicational difficulties. We must recognize, express and clarify
   them to improve the situation. Difficult patients with whom
   communication is difficult such as confuse, agitated, terminal, elder,
   manipulating or hypochondriac subjects. The idea of transference and
   counter tin these in these complicated situations is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately two thirds of all Dutch cancer patients have severe
   emotional problems shortly after their change from the treatment regime
   into the regime of medical controls. Half of them even need professional

   helps to overcome the existential crisis of being a cancer patient; it
   is an essential step in the revalidation process. Themes and open

   the effectiveness of the treatment. Communication skills are of
   particular importance for health care providers dealing with patients
   having chronic diseases such as haemophilia. In addition to the
   difficulties inherent to the chronicity of the disease, the HIV
   contamination has dramatically impaired the relationships between
   patients and health care providers, creating a lot of pain, still alive

   care providers and patients some tools to deal with their feelings and

Abstract = {{Medical educators have always recognized the need to teach and train
   medical graduates and undergraduates the skills of conducting a
   consultation. Several authors have established the efficacy of using
   constructive feedback on videotape of each student's interaction with a
   patient to teach and enhance such skills. This study reports `students'
   perceptions' of the feedback process used in the Junior Paediatric
   Clerkship at the Faculty of Medicine of the United Arab Emirates
   University. An unexpected 73\% of the respondents believed that
   self-observation influenced development of their clinical skills. More
   than 80\% said that the feedback from instructors and peers helped them
   to improve their clinical skills, but they would have liked to have more
   than one of their consultations recorded and reviewed. It was found that
   75\% of the students felt that self-critique of their performance made
   them aware of their strengths and weaknesses and their skills in
   analysing and evaluating consultations had been enhanced. It was found

Abstract = {{Compliance with medical advice has always been a problem and there has
   always been discussion on who is to blame for noncompliance: the
   illness, the physician, the patient or the drug? A consensus between the
   physician's beliefs, views and representations of the nature and the
   etiology of the depression and of the treatment options on the one hand
   and the patient with his individual life story on the other is probably
   the best guarantee of reasonable compliance. In particular, a
   physician-patient consensus about the emotional meaning of the illness
   is essential: patients should be given the opportunity to express their
   feelings about the illness and what it signifies, and physicians should
   respond with feedback using the patient's concepts and emotional
   expression. Within this context of dialogue, patients may signal their
   resistance to and potential noncompliance with the physician's views. An
   empathic model of understanding can be used in the initial stages of the
   consultation. Finding an equilibrium between the cognitive-informational
   aspects of depressive illness and treatment on one hand and
   affective-motivational aspects on the other is a key factor in
   antidepressive treatment. Physicians should indeed always try to
   overcome the gap between the affective (empathy, motivational aspects)
   and the instrumental dimensions (correct diagnosis, adequate treatment)
   of their behavior. (C) 1998 Rapid Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Suffering is a universal experience. In everyday practice, physicians
   and patients confront and deal with this phenomenon. It is surprising
   that, despite its obvious and inexorable presence, there is no universal
   understanding of the real significance of suffering. In the same
   context, it seems that ``the measure of suffering{''} could be an
   option, an instrument, for evaluating the efficacy of treatment. No
   doubt, it is easier to compare laboratory or x-ray results than to
   follow clinically the severity of the disease. However, patients do not
   understand this language, and, often, physicians do not explain to
   patients how they determine that treatment is efficacious. Ln fact, it
   is common to hear patients complain that they do not feel better despite
   the doctors' opinion that they should.
   Often, we must accept that our capabilities are limited and must offer
   some help to mitigate our patients' suffering. Empathy, and the
   responsibility of doctors to understand the different meanings of
   suffering, can help patients. Because of their skills, because they know
   the meaning of disease, and because of their commitment, doctors are
   obliged to comprehend the position of the patients who are suffering. In
   the middle of the storm of science, doctors need to look for disease in
   the voices and in the eyes of their patients. In fact, there should be
   no conflict between science and empathy. The magic link must rest in the
   intelligence and sensitivity of doctors.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the application of technology to promote more
   comprehensive clinical education in the biopsychosocial aspects of
   primary care. Comprehensive refers to the inclusion, in addition to
   scientific and technical knowledge, of knowledge that is less easily
   characterized, quantified, and taught: empathy, intuition, the
   demonstration of artistry. Clinical education will be increasingly
   facilitated by the proliferation of computers capable of displaying
   combinations of text, graphics, video, and sound; broadband networks
   capable of delivering these multiple media to the home or office; and
   new methods for using these technologies for education and training.
   However, current models for technology-based learning are limiting,
   lagging behind the rapid technological evolution driving our entry into
   the Information Age. Some recent educational models (Schon's
   reflection-in-action and reflective practicums {[}1], Boisot's E-space
   {[}2], Kolb's learning cycle {[}3]) provide for a more comprehensive and
   complete view of health professional education. This article describes
   these models in depth and proposes a new model for technology-based
   clinical training, the ``Virtual Practicum,{''} based on them. The
   Virtual Practicum is illustrated with a new interactive CD-ROM program,
   dealing with primary care of patients with HIV/AIDS. The concepts
   presented here are generally useful in thinking about clinical
   education, regardless of the means used.}},

Abstract = {{The health care received from first admission to a pediatric
   rheumatology clinic to 9-year follow-up was assessed in 109 patients
   with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases or chronic idiopathic
   musculoskeletal pain. Ninety-five of the patients had received hospital
   care after the first admission, of whom 53 patients greater than or
   equal to 18 years, 21 patients < 18 years, and 33 parents of patients <
   18 years rated their degree of satisfaction with the health care from 0
   to 10. Mean scores of satisfaction with different aspects of care ranged
   from 6.0 to 9.6. Among patients greater than or equal to 18 years, those
   with idiopathic pain were less satisfied than those with inflammatory
   rheumatic diseases on the availability of care (mean 6.4 vs. 8.5, p <
   0.001), continuity of care (mean 6.5 vs. 8.4, p < 0.001), and empathy of
   the health care providers (mean 6.7 vs. 7.9, p < 0.05). The diagnostic
   group and the occurrence of remission predicted the level of global
   satisfaction in patients greater than or equal to 18 years. In patients
   < 18 years, chronic family difficulties predicted patient satisfaction
   and physical disability and chronic family difficulties predicted parent
   satisfaction. In conclusion, most parents and patients with inflammatory
   rheumatic diseases were satisfied with the health care. However, some
   patients with idiopathic pain had unmet needs for care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy has long been thought to be an important
   characteristic of a good physician, and a measure of empathy is needed
   to provide feedback to medical students, residents, and physicians on
   this important aspect of their clinical performance. The
   standardized-patient-resting format provides a simple but intuitvely
   convincing approach to the assessment of empathy.
   Purpose: To determine the extent to which 4th-year medical students were
   checked ``empathic{''} by standardized patients (SPs) on a
   performance-based examination, to evaluate the psychometric properties
   of this simple empathy measure, and to see whether empathy was related
   to clinical performance on history taking and physical examination.
   Method: Analyses were performed on examination data for 1,048 senior
   medical students in the 8 member schools of the New York City Consortium
   tested at The Morchand Center of Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
   Results: The percentage of students who were checked ``empathic{''}
   ranged from 59\% to 98\% (M = 79\%) across the 7 SP cases. Of the 1,048
   students, 268 (26\%) were checked ``empathic{''} on all 7 cases;
   however, 221 (21\%) were checked on less than or equal to 4 cases, 90
   (9\%) on less than or equal to 3 cases, and 26 (3\%) on less than or
   equal to 2 cases. The generalizability coefficient of the overall
   empathy scores was .43; the dependability index with cutoff was .81 for
   detecting students checked ``empathic{''} on fewer than half of the 7
   cases. The correlations of the empathy item with the other checklist
   items suggest that the empathy construct refers to behaviors that make
   the patient feel comfortable and important. Also, students who were
   checked ``empathic{''} on fewer than half of the 7 cases performed lower
   on history taking and physical examination.
   Conclusions: Empathy appears to be reasonably acceptable in this sample
   of students, although it is of concern that on average, more than 200
   students per case were not seen as empathic, and more than 200 were
   checked ``empathic{''} on less than or equal to 4 of the 7 cases. These
   results show the potential usefulness of this simple measure of empathy
   and illustrate the need for feedback to address any problems.}},
