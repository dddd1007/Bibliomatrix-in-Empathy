Abstract = {{We incorporated the views of patients to develop a comprehensive set of
   ideal physician behaviors. Telephone interviews were conducted in 2001
   and 2002 with a random sample of 192 patients who were seen in 14
   different medical specialties of Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz, and
   Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Interviews focused on the
   physician-patient relationship and lasted between 20 and 50 minutes.
   Patients were asked to describe their best and worst experiences with a
   physician in the Mayo Clinic system and to give specifics of the
   encounter. The interviewers independently generated and validated 7
   ideal behavioral themes that emerged from the interview transcripts. The
   ideal physician is confident, empathetic, humane, personal, forthright,
   respectful, and thorough. Ways that physicians can incorporate clues to
   the 7 ideal physician behaviors to create positive relationships with
   patients are suggested.}},

Title = {{Training the clinical eye and mind: using the arts to develop medical
   students' observational and pattern recognition skills}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{263-268}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Observation, including identification of key pieces of
   data, pattern recognition, and interpretation of significance and
   meaning, is a key element in medical decision making. Clinical
   observation is taught primarily through preceptor modelling during the
   all-important clinical years. No single method exists for communicating
   these skills, and medical educators have periodically experimented with
   using arts-based training to hone observational acuity. The purpose of
   this qualitative study was to better understand the similarities and
   differences between arts-based and clinical teaching approaches to
   convey observation and pattern recognition skills.
   METHOD A total of 38 Year 3 students participated in either small group
   training with clinical photographs and paper cases ( group 1), or small
   group training using art plus dance ( group 2), both consisting of 3
   2-hour sessions over a 6-month period.
   FINDINGS Students in both conditions found value in the training they
   received and, by both self- and instructor-report, appeared to hone
   observation skills and improve pattern recognition. The clinically based
   condition appeared to have been particularly successful in conveying
   pattern recognition concepts to students, probably because patterns
   presented in this condition had specific correspondence with actual
   clinical situations, whereas patterns in art could not be generalised so
   easily to patients. In the arts-based conditions, students also
   developed skills in emotional recognition, cultivation of empathy,
   identification of story and narrative, and awareness of multiple
   perspectives.
   CONCLUSION The interventions studied were naturally complementary and,
   taken together, can bring greater texture to the process of teaching
   clinical medicine by helping us see a more complete `picture' of the
   patient.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The authors describe a longitudinal third- and fourth-year elective,
   `The Art of Doctoring, introduced in an attempt to counteract perceived
   frustration and cynicism in medical students at their home institution
   during the clinical years. The course goals aimed at helping students to
   develop self-reflective skills; improve awareness of and ability to
   modify personal attitudes and behaviors that compromise patient care;
   increase altruism, empathy and compassion toward patients; and sustain
   commitment to patient care, service and personal well-being. These goals
   were accomplished through introduction and development of five skill
   sets: learning from role models and peers; on-site readings of works by
   medical student- and physician-authors; self- and other-observation;
   self-reflective techniques; and case-based problem-solving. The course
   involved regular in-class exercises and homework assignments, as well as
   a personal project related to improving personal compassion, caring and
   empathy toward patients. Students also learned to use a coping algorithm
   to approach problematic clinical and interpersonal situations. Class
   discussions revealed three issues of recurring importance to students:
   loss of idealism, non-compliant patients, and indifferent, harsh or
   otherwise unpleasant attendings and residents. Quantitative and
   qualitative student evaluations overall indicated a generally favorable
   response to the course. Problems and barriers included attendance
   difficulties and van. able levels of student engagement. Future
   directions for this type of educational intervention are considered, as
   well as its implications for medical education.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of ``emotional intelligence'' has been extensively
   popularized in the lay press and corporate world as individuals purport
   the potential ability of emotional intelligence to predict various
   markers of success. Emotional intelligence (EI) most commonly
   incorporates concepts of emotional expression and regulation,
   self-awareness, and empathy. The concept has been criticized by some for
   its loose definition and parallels to personality traits. Additionally,
   several limitations to the instruments used to measure emotional
   intelligence have been identified. This review examines the foundations

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{E214-E219}},
Abstract = {{Selection of suitable students into graduate medical and specialist
   health professional courses can be difficult. Historically, selection of
   students was primarily based on prior academic performance. Recently,
   however, more emphasis has been placed on considering broader academic
   backgrounds and personal characteristics and attitudes of students, but
   no reliable measurement tool is available to predict student success and
   satisfaction with their choice of profession. The aim of this study was
   to survey practising radiation therapists in Australia to seek their
   opinions regarding suitable selection criteria for graduate entry
   radiation therapy (RT) students in order to optimize selection
   procedures for future applicants. Four hundred questionnaires were sent
   to nine RT centres in three states within Australia. All nine clinics
   participated in the survey and 189 questionnaires were returned. Results
   show that the majority of radiation therapists place a high level of
   importance upon a sound knowledge of physics and mathematics, as well as
   life experience, and agree that a visit to an RT clinic plus an
   interview comprise important components of the selection process.
   Humanities, psychology and a psychometric test were not viewed as
   essential entry requirements. Experienced radiation therapists placed
   less value on academic performance in the primary degree and were more
   likely to include an interview as a selection criterion than junior
   practitioners. Empathy for patients was identified as the most important
   personal attribute. It is thus recommended that not only cognitive but
   also personal skills be evaluated during the selection of prospective
   radiation therapists.}},

Abstract = {{How to train competent and compassionate physicians has assumed a new
   urgency. The authors propose that these concerns be approached by
   radically restructuring the medical school curriculum in ways that place
   facts and skills within the context of ethics and values. Doing so will
   require that the positivist stance of medical education be coupled to
   strategies that deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, communication and
   empathy, and, most important, physician self-awareness. Achieving such
   balance will require fundamental change in medicine's education
   philosophy along five general lines: (1) assertion of medical ethics as
   the foundation of clinical medicine; (2) recognition of the central
   place of values in clinical decision making; (3) cultivation of the
   ethos of humane care; (4) selection of medical students with the dual
   capacities of strong cognitive skills and empathy; and (5) encouragement
   and support of faculty who can transmit the knowledge of clinical
   science coupled to the principles of humane care.
   Such changes are both timely and necessary. Although they will be
   difficult to accomplish, they offer an opportunity for medical educators
   to foster the development of physicians with the range attributes that
   this new century demands.}},

Pages = {{481-490}},

Abstract = {{Rationale for study - The American Veterinary Medical Association's
   policy states that veterinarians are obliged to promote good animal
   welfare. In order to establish how compatible the attitudes of future
   veterinarians in one North American Veterinary College were with the
   promotion of good animal welfare, students were surveyed with respect to
   their opinions about the humaneness of commonly employed agricultural
   procedures (e.g., hot branding) and their beliefs about the cognitive
   ability of various domesticated species.
   Methodology - A Web-based questionnaire was made available to all
   veterinary students at Cornell University. Descriptive summary data were
   collected with regards to students' perceptions of the cognitive
   abilities of six different domesticated species. Students were also
   asked if they considered certain agricultural procedures to be humane
   for each of these species. The data were analyzed with respect to
   students' future career goals. Chi-squared tests and nonparametric
   statistical techniques were used to examine differences between species
   and desired career goals.
   Results and Conclusions - Veterinary students were more likely to
   believe that dogs and cats had cognitive abilities than farm animals
   did. Students considered various procedures to be more humane for farm
   mammals than for dogs and cats. Students aspiring to work with food
   animals considered more procedures to be humane for all species than did
   students aspiring to work with small animals. The inconsistency of
   students' attitudes for different species has implications for
   veterinary education and animal welfare. Scientific fields integral to
   understanding animal welfare may need to be emphasized within the
   veterinary educational curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{At least 40 to 60 percent of women and at least 20 percent of men with
   chronic pain disorders report a history of being abused during childhood
   and/or adulthood. This incidence of abuse is two to four times higher
   than in the general population. Patients with more severe or frequent
   abuse, usually during childhood and worse if sexual in nature. often
   develop specific syndromes or combinations of syndromes. These syndromes
   include posttraumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia, and other
   conditions characterized by repression, somatization, and increased
   utilization of medical care. Psychosomatic symptoms and dysfunctional
   behaviors may emerge as these patients seek attention and validation of
   their suffering, while paradoxically repressing painful memories of
   trauma. Behavioral observations and key features of the physical
   examination may greatly help the clinician identify both the presence
   and severity of psychosomatic disease. In addition, it is very
   interesting that various studies document physiologic changes in the
   brains of patients with a history of abuse and in patients with a
   diagnosis of fibromyalgia. These studies suggest that abuse may
   physiologically and developmentally increase a person's susceptibility
   to pain and that some organic changes may be associated with psychogenic
   disease.
   Diagnosis and treatment of even the most challenging patients with
   chronic pain is much more effective if it includes (a) careful inquiry
   about any history of past or present abuse or other severe trauma, (b)
   empathy and constructive validation of disease and suffering, (c)
   recognition of dysfunctional pain behaviors and personality traits, (d)
   documentation of nonanatomic as well as anatomic features on
   examination, (e) multidisciplinary treatments including psychotherapy
   whenever indicated, and (1) noninvasive procedures and alternatives to
   potentially habit-forming medications whenever possible and appropriate.
   Furthermore, it has been shown that helping patients gain insight about
   the relationship between abuse and their current symptoms leads to
   decreased health care utilization. Practical guidelines are provided for
   identifying psychopathology, communicating effectively, and achieving
   better treatment outcomes for these unfortunate patients.}},

Title = {{Patient participation in medical consultations - Why some patients are
   more involved than others}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients vary in their willingness and ability to actively
   participate in medical consultations. Because more active patient
   participation contributes to improved health outcomes and quality of
   care, it is important to understand factors affecting the way patients
   communicate with healthcare providers.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to examine the extent to
   which patient participation in medical interactions is influenced by 1)
   the patient's personal characteristics (age, gender, education,
   ethnicity); 2) the physician's communication style (eg, use of
   partnership-building and supportive talk); and 3) the clinical setting
   (eg, the health condition, medical specialty).
   Research Design and Subjects: The authors conducted a post hoc
   cross-sectional analysis of 279 physician-patient interactions from 3
   clinical sites: 1) primary care patients in Sacramento, California, 2)
   patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the San Francisco
   Bay area, and 3) patients with lung cancer from a VA hospital in Texas.
   Main Outcome Measures: The outcome measures included the degree to which
   patients asked questions, were assertive, and expressed concerns and the
   degree to which physicians used partnership-building and supportive talk
   (praise, reassurance, empathy) in their consultations.
   Results: The majority of active participation behaviours were
   patient-initiated (84\%) rather than prompted by physician
   partnership-building or supportive talk. Patients who were more active
   participants received more facilitative communication from physicians,
   were more educated, and were more likely to be white than of another
   ethnicity. Women more willingly expressed negative feelings and
   concerns. There was considerable variability in patient participation
   across the 3 clinical settings. Female physicians were more likely to
   use supportive talk than males, and physicians generally used less
   supportive talk with nonwhite compared with white patients.
   Conclusions: Patient participation in medical encounters depends on a
   complex interplay of personal, physician, and contextual factors.
   Although more educated and white patients tended to be more active
   participants than their counterparts, the strongest predictors of
   patient participation were situation-specific, namely the clinical
   setting and the physician's communicative style. Physicians could more
   effectively facilitate patient involvement by more frequently using
   partnership-building and supportive communication. Future research
   should investigate how the nuances of individual clinical settings (eg,
   the health condition, time allotted for the visit) impose constraints or
   opportunities for more effective patient involvement in care.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to describe the experience and expectations of
   Chinese cancer patients with regard to the favorable and unfavorable
   words conveyed by their social support providers. In-depth interviews
   were conducted with 20 patients with cancer using a qualitative
   approach, and the data obtained were analyzed using content analysis.
   The findings indicated that favorable words inspired patients with
   cancer and raised their hopes. Such words included words expressing
   positive confirmation of patients' physical condition and mental status,
   words of encouragement and consolation, discussions of successful cases,
   information about advanced medical techniques and developments,
   practical instructions, emotional support from close relatives,
   confirmation about previous achievements for the family and about one's
   career, as well as small talk to distract the patient. Unfavorable words
   were those that weakened the patients' hopes and self-esteem. They
   included words expressing negative information and pessimistic
   attitudes, those indicating an overprotective attitude on the part of
   close relatives, as well as words expressing commiseration, advice, and
   an underestimation of the patients' suffering without empathy. The
   findings provide guidelines for nurses to communicate with patients with
   cancer verbally in a Chinese cultural context, and outline strategies
   for communication to meet psychologic needs of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To relate prospectively initial consultation
   characteristics-length, empathy, and patient enablement-with perceived
   health changes in patients going to the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital
   (GHH).
   Methods: Consecutive outpatients completed the Consultation and
   Relational Empathy (CARE) measure and the Patient Enablement Instrument
   (PEI) immediately after their first consultations, again at 3 months,
   and the PEI also at 12 months. The Short Form-12 was completed
   immediately before and the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome (MYMOP)
   Profile during the first consultation, and both were repeated at 3 and
   12 months. Perceived changes in main complaint and well-being were
   assessed using the Glasgow Homoeopathic Outcome Scale (GHHOS).
   Results: Empathy score at first consultation was highly predictive of
   ongoing empathy score at 3 months (Spearman's rho, 0.572, p < 0.0001).
   Empathy scores at first consultation also correlated significantly with
   enablement score at first consultation (rho, 0.325, p < 0.0001) and
   overall enablement at 12 months (rho, 0.281; p < 0.05). Controlling for
   the number of subsequent consultations, initial empathy scores were also
   predictive of change in main complaint, and general well-being, at 3
   months (rho, 0.225, 0.213 respectively; p < 0.05). Enablement score at
   first consultation also predicted overall enablement at 3 months (rho,
   0.255; p < 0.05) and 12 months (rho, 0.282; p < 0.05). Initial
   enablement predicted GHOSS well-being score at 3 months after
   controlling for number of consultations (rho, 0.279; p < 0.05). Both
   empathy and enablement at 3 months predicted overall enablement at 12
   months (rho, 0.327; p < 0.01 and rho, 0.577; p < 0.0001, respectively).
   Empathy at 3 months was not significantly related to GHHOS scores at 12
   months, whereas enablement scores at 3 months were highly predictive of
   both GHHOS main complaint and well-being scores at 12 months (rho, 0.459
   and 0.507, respectively; p < 0.0001). Empathy and enablement scores did
   not correlate significantly with changes in SF-12 and MYMOP scores at
   any of the time points. The length of the first consultation was related
   to initial and subsequent CARE scores, overall enablement, and GHHOS
   scores at 3 and 12 months.
   Conclusions: Empathy is crucial for enablement, which, in turn, is
   strongly related to perceived change in main complaint and well-being.
   The length of time the clinician spends with a patient at initial
   consultation appears to be an important factor in these complex
   relationships among process and outcome.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Most continuing medical education programs on intimate
   partner violence (IPV) use an expert-driven approach and focus on
   changing knowledge and screening behaviors. The Voices of Survivors
   program aims to also improve attitudes and empathy.
   OBJECTIVES: To test the Attitudes Toward Survivors of IPV (ATSI) survey
   psychometrically. To assess the effectiveness of the Voices of Survivors
   program in changing health care workers' responsibility to assess for
   and counsel about IPV, respect for patient autonomy, empathy toward
   patients in abusive relationships, barriers, confidence, knowledge, and
   self-reported assessment behaviors.
   SETTING: Thirty-one unaffiliated primary care practices in Washington
   County, Ore.
   DESIGN: Comparison of ATSI survey results before and after a two-hour
   workshop including a 30-minute video and an advocate-led discussion.
   PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of primary care providers, medical
   support staff, and other clinic employees.
   RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-four health care workers participated in
   the training. Two hundred and sixty-seven (94\%) completed workshop
   evaluations and 187 (66\%) completed both pre- and postintervention
   surveys. Cronbach's alpha for all scales ranged from 0.68 to 0.92.
   Postintervention, participants' summary scores improved for
   responsibility to assess for IPV (3.96 vs 3.64; P < .0001), respect for
   patient autonomy (2.78 vs 2.41; P < . 0001), empathy (3.24 vs. 2.99; P =
   .002), confidence (2.33 vs 2.07; P < .0001), knowledge (2.08 vs 1.64; P
   < .0001), and self-reported behaviors (3.08 vs 2.53; P = .0001).
   Barriers related to availability of resources and referrals also
   improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ATSI scales demonstrated good internal reliability and
   responsiveness to change in all domains except responsibility to
   counsel. The Voices of Survivors documentary, along with a workshop
   based on its companion guide, improved clinic employees' knowledge,
   attitudes, empathy, and self-reported assessment behaviors about IPV.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To explore third-year medical students' experiences with death
   and dying patients during the first internal medicine clerkship.
   Method In August 2002, through purposeful sampling, the authors targeted
   for open-ended interviews 32 third-year medical students at the
   University of California, San Francisco in the first core internal
   medicine clerkship. Interviews averaged 45 minutes in length and were
   audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach.
   Results Twenty-eight (87.5\%) students participated in interviews. All
   students encountered death or dying patients, and most cared directly
   for at least one dying patient. Students' relationships with patients
   were characterized by attachment, empathy, and advocacy. Students valued
   preparation by preclinical end-of-life (EOL) courses, but assigned
   greater value to patient care experiences guided by teams that
   acknowledged deaths, role-modeled EOL care, and respected students'
   participation in patient care. Clerkship experiences in EOL care
   affected students' developing professional identities by affording
   opportunities to manage strong emotions, understand the challenges of
   transitioning to residency, and gain a sense of self-efficacy as future
   physicians providing EOL care.
   Conclusions Third-year medical students' experiences with dying patients
   affect their skills and attitudes in EOL care, as well as the emergence
   of their professional identities. The behaviors and attitudes modeled by
   residents and attendings during the clerkships can strongly influence
   students' perceptions of and self-efficacy in EOL care. Further research
   and interventions into how residents and attendings model responses to
   death in the clinical clerkship may suggest strategies not only for EOL
   training, but also for mentoring professional development.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Prior research has shown that people mispredict their own behavior and
   preferences across affective states. When people are in an affectively
   ``cold{''} state, they fail to fully appreciate how ``hot{''} states
   will affect their own preferences and behavior. When in hot states, they
   underestimate the influence of those states and, as a result,
   overestimate the stability of their current preferences. The same biases
   apply interpersonally; for example, people who are not affectively
   aroused underappreciate the impact of hot states on other people's
   behavior. After reviewing research documenting such intrapersonal and
   interpersonal hot-cold empathy gaps, this article examines their
   consequences for medical, and specifically cancer-related, decision
   making, showing, for example, that hot-cold empathy gaps can lead
   healthy persons to expose themselves excessively to health risks and can
   cause health care providers to undertreat patients for pain.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: While resident distress and its potential to negatively
   effect patient care have been well documented, little is known about
   resident well-being or its potential to enhance care.
   OBJECTIVE: We measured resident well-being and explored its relationship
   with empathy.
   DESIGN: Anonymous, cross-sectional survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: Internal medicine residents at Mayo Clinic Rochester (n =
   165, summer 2003).
   MEASUREMENTS: Well- being was measured using the previously validated
   Medical Outcomes Study 8-item Short Form (SF-8). Empathy was measured
   using the previously validated Perspective Taking (PT) and Empathetic
   Concerns (EC) Sub-scales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).
   RESULTS: Eighty-three (50\%) residents responded to the survey. Mean
   scores for well-being as measured by the SF-8 were comparable to the
   general population, and empathy scores on the IRI were similar to other
   resident samples. Resident empathy on both the cognitive (PT) and
   emotive (EC) sub-scales of the IRI was higher for residents with higher
   mental well-being on the SF-8; however, this difference was
   statistically significant only for the cognitive sub-scale. The
   importance of a number of personal wellness promotion strategies
   differed for residents with higher mental well-being on the SF-8.
   CONCLUSIONS: High mental well-being was associated with enhanced
   resident empathy in this cross-sectional survey. Future studies need to
   explore the potential for high resident well- being to enhance medical
   care and competency in addition to exploring the negative consequences
   of resident distress. Studies investigating how to promote resident
   well-being are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Escalating health care costs are affecting patients across the country.
   As employers and insurance companies face higher expenses, they may move
   to a cost-sharing strategy, which potentially increases financial
   burdens on patients. In this situation, physicians may find themselves
   serving as both medical and financial advisors for their patients.
   Clinical encounters in which patients experience financial hardship can
   be awkward and frustrating for both parties. Physicians must learn to
   discuss issues of affordability in a manner that builds, rather than
   detracts, from a therapeutic alliance. This article describes our
   experiences using several communication skills that can help in the
   discussion of health care costs with patients. The primary skill,
   empathic communication, which includes ``we{''} statements and ``I wish
   ...{''} statements, serves to create a platform for shared
   decision-making, negotiation, and a search for alternatives. In
   addition, it is helpful if physician offices have resource materials
   available and strategies identified to assist patients facing financial
   hardship.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Although patients with cancer are often accompanied by a
   relative during medical interviews, to the authors' knowledge little is
   known regarding the efficacy of communication skills training programs
   on physicians' communication skills in this context. The objective of
   the current study was to assess the efficacy of 6 consolidation
   workshops, 3 hours in length, that were conducted after a 2.5-day basic
   training program.
   METHODS. After attending the basic training program, physicians were
   assigned randomly to consolidation workshops or to a waiting list.
   Training efficacy was assessed through simulated and actual interviews
   that were recorded on an audio tape at baseline, after consolidation
   workshops for the consolidation-workshops group, and 5 months after the
   end of basic training for the waiting-list group. Communication skills
   were assessed according to the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop
   Evaluation Manual. Patients' and relatives' perceptions of and
   satisfaction with physicians' communication performance were assessed
   using a 15-item questionnaire.
   RESULTS. Sixty-two physicians completed the training program. Compared
   with physicians who participated to the basic training program, when
   addressing the patient, physicians who were randomized to the
   consolidation workshops used more open, open directive, and screening
   questions (P = 0.011 in simulated patient interviews and P = 0.005 in
   actual patient interviews) and elicited and clarified psychologic
   concerns more often (P = 0.006 in simulated patient interviews and P <
   0.001 in actual patient interviews). When they addressed the relative,
   physicians who were randomized to the consolidation workshops gave less
   premature information (P = 0.032 in simulated patient interviews and P <
   0.001 in actual patient interviews). When they addressed the patient and
   the relative simultaneously, physicians who were randomized to the
   consolidation workshops used more empathy, educated guesses, alerting to
   reality, confronting, negotiating, and summarizing (P = 0.003 in
   simulated patient interviews and P = 0.024 in actual patient
   interviews). Patients, but not relatives, who interacted with physicians
   in the consolidation-workshops group were more satisfied globally with
   the interviews (P = 0.022).
   CONCLUSIONS. Six 3-hour consolidation workshops resulted in improved
   communication skills addressed to patients and to relatives. The current
   results showed that the transfer of skills addressing relatives'
   concerns remained limited and that consolidation workshops should focus
   even more systematically on the practice of three-person interviews. (c)

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND This project introduced medicine-related poetry and prose to
   a Year 3 family medicine clerkship with the purpose of determining
   students' perception of the usefulness of such materials to enhance
   empathy, improve patient management, and reduce stress. Although
   humanities are represented in the curricula of many medical schools, we
   need more information on how best to incorporate them during the
   clinical years.
   METHOD In 2000, we used a needs assessment survey to identify learner
   perceptions of medical humanities. Using this information, in 2001-03 we
   developed and implemented a humanities-based curriculum consisting of
   readings linked to clinical vignettes, comments about humanities reading
   in required clinical Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP)
   notes, and either station-specific or general poetry accompanying
   student end-of-clerkship objective structured clinical examinations. We
   collected both quantitative and qualitative data assessing student
   reactions and examined the data using non-parametric statistics and
   content analysis, respectively.
   RESULTS Students showed moderate interest in incorporating humanities in
   medical education as a way of enhancing empathy, improving understanding
   and reducing frustration. Assessment of the clerkship humanities
   curriculum suggested a positive influence on students in terms of
   empathy for the patient's perspective, and a lesser, but still positive,
   impact on patient management.
   DISCUSSION Responses from this group of learners suggest that there is
   receptivity toward introducing medical humanities into family medicine
   curricular venues and that such effort can have a generally positive
   effect on learner empathy, awareness and understanding toward patients
   and doctors.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Balint training is used in many family
   medicine residency programs to encourage self-reflection and exploration
   of the physician-patient encounter There is limited objective research,
   however, on outcomes of Balint training. This study's purpose was to
   determine whether Balint training is associated with, differences in
   physician empathy and work satisfaction. Methods: The Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy and a validated survey on physician work satisfaction
   were mailed to 182 graduates of the Medical University of South Carolina
   (MUSC) Family Medicine Residency Program (113 Balint attendees and 69
   nonattendees). The Dillman method of survey design was followed.
   Results: The two groups were not statistically different in demographic
   measures. Balint attendees had a similar mean empathy score (119.4) as
   nonattendees (116.7). There was also no statistically significant
   difference in overall work satisfaction or satisfaction with financial
   compensation. Balint attendees were, however, more likely to say they
   would choose the same specialty if they could choose again than did
   nonattendees (86.1\% versus 55\%). Conclusions: There was no association

   clinical education}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{534-540}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Narrative inquiry is a form of qualitative research that
   takes story as either its raw data or its product. Science and narrative
   can be seen as two kinds of knowing, reflected in the distinction
   between evidence-based medicine derived from population studies and
   narrative-based medicine focused upon the single case. A similar tension
   exists in the field of narrative inquiry between cognitive-orientated
   analytical methods and affective-orientated methods of synthesis.
   AIMS This paper aims to make sense of narrative inquiry in clinical
   education through definition of `narrative', articulation of a typology
   of narrative research approaches, and critical examination in particular
   of analytical methods, the dominant approach in the literature. The
   typology is illustrated by research examples, and the role of medical
   education in developing expertise in narrative inquiry is discussed. An
   argument is made that the tension between analysis of the structure of
   stories and empathic use of stories can be seen as productive,
   stimulating expertise encompassing both approaches.
   DISCUSSION Analytical methods tend to lose the concrete story and its
   emotional impact to abstract categorisations, which may claim
   explanatory value but often remain descriptive. Stemming from discomfort
   with more integrative methods derived from the humanities, a
   science-orientated medical education may privilege analytical methods
   over approaches of synthesis. Medical education can redress this
   imbalance through attention to `thinking with stories' to gain empathy
   for a patient's experience of illness. Such an approach can complement
   understanding of story as discourse - how narratives may be used
   rhetorically to manage both social interactions and identity.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To review the relevant literature regarding the predictive
   ability of cognitive measures (ie, Pharmacy College Admissions Test
   {[}PCAT] scores and prepharmacy grade point average {[}GPA]) on both
   academic and clinical performance and discuss the inclusion of
   nontraditional assessment during the admissions process.
   DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified through searches of International
   Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2004), MEDLINE (1966-January 2004),
   and ERIC (1966-April 2004) using the key words admissions variables,
   predictors of success, Pharmacy College Admissions Test, grade point
   average, cognitive variables, and noncognitive variables.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and
   retrospective studies, as well as reviews, regarding pharmacy school and
   other higher education admissions' variables were included in this
   review.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Many pharmacy school admissions committees give a
   majority weight to the traditional cognitive markers of prepharmacy GPA
   and PCAT scores when selecting viable applicants. Doing so may be
   problematic due to the magnitude of the relationship between traditional
   cognitive predictors and pharmacy school performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review, a cogent argument is advanced for the
   need to examine, in addition to PLAT scores and GPAs, such
   nontraditional factors as empathy, citizenship, and ethical behavior.
   This may increase the predictive ability of preadmission factors on
   pharmacy school didactic and clinical performance. Schools of pharmacy
   can do this through questionnaires and interviews designed to assess
   nontraditional variables.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy should characterize all health care professions. Despite
   advancement in medical technology, the healing relationship between
   physicians and patients remains essential to quality care. We propose
   that physicians consider empathy as emotional labor (ie, management of
   experienced and displayed emotions to present a certain image). Since
   the publication of Hochschild's The Managed Heart in 1983, researchers
   in management and organization behavior have been studying emotional
   labor by service workers, such as flight attendants and bill collectors.
   In this article, we focus on physicians as professionals who are
   expected to be empathic caregivers. They engage in such emotional labor
   through deep acting (ie, generating empathy-consistent emotional and
   cognitive reactions before and during empathic interactions with the
   patient, similar to the method-acting tradition used by some stage and
   screen actors), surface acting (ie, forging empathic behaviors toward
   the patient, absent of consistent emotional and cognitive reactions), or
   both. Although deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface
   acting when immediate emotional and cognitive understanding of patients
   is impossible. Overall, we contend that physicians are more effective
   healers-and enjoy more professional satisfaction-when they engage in the
   process of empathy. We urge physicians first to recognize that their
   work has an element of emotional labor and, second, to consciously
   practice deep and surface acting to empathize with their patients.
   Medical students and residents can benefit from long-term regular
   training that includes conscious efforts to develop their empathic
   abilities. This will be valuable for both physicians and patients facing
   the increasingly fragmented and technological world of modern medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Clinician-parent conversations in perinatology and neonatology are
   demanding. They take place over a period of time and ask much of the
   clinician. Many parents insist that they want thorough explanations so
   they can understand the medical information and its impact on them.
   These cases involve copious amounts of medical and resource information
   and parents cannot assimilate it all at one time; thus, these
   conversations are extended dialogs. Conversational skills that seem
   essential for clinicians in this work include giving bad news, sharing
   information, and expressing empathy. Underlying the conversational

Abstract = {{Music is widely used to enhance well-being, reduce stress, and distract
   patients from unpleasant symptoms. Although there are wide variations in
   individual preferences, music appears to exert direct physiologic
   effects through the autonomic nervous system. It also has indirect
   effects by modifying caregiver behavior. Music effectively reduces
   anxiety and improves mood for medical and surgical patients, for
   patients in intensive care units and patients undergoing procedures, and
   for children as well as adults. Music is a low-cost intervention that
   often reduces surgical, procedural, acute, and chronic pain. Music also
   improves the quality of life for patients receiving palliative care,
   enhancing a sense of comfort and relaxation. Providing music to
   caregivers may be a cost-effective and enjoyable strategy to improve
   empathy, compassion, and relationship-centered care while not increasing
   errors or interfering with technical aspects of care.}},

Abstract = {{The need for physicians to have patient-centered communication skills is
   reflected in the educational objectives of numerous medical schools'
   curricula and in the competencies required by groups such as the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. An innovative
   method for teaching communications skills has been developed at the
   University of Colorado School of Medicine as part of its three-year,
   longitudinal course focusing on basic clinical skills required of all
   physicians. The method emphasizes techniques of open-ended inquiry,
   empathy, and engagement to gather data. Students refer to the method as
   ILS, or Invite, Listen, and Summarize. ILS was developed to combat the
   high-physician-control interview techniques, characterized by a series
   of ``yes{''} or ``no{''} questions. The authors began teaching the ILS
   approach in 2001 as one basic exercise and have since developed a
   two-year longitudinal communications curriculum. ILS is easy to use and
   remember, and it emphasizes techniques that have been shown in other
   studies to achieve the three basic functions of the medical interview:
   creating rapport, collecting good data, and improving compliance. The
   skills are taught using standardized patients in a series of four
   small-group exercises. Videotaped standardized patient encounters are
   used to evaluate the students. Tutors come from a variety of disciplines
   and receive standardized training. The curriculum has been well
   received. Despite the fact that the formal curriculum only occurs in the
   first two years, there is some evidence that it is improving students'
   interviewing skills at the end of their third year.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The objective of this study is to evaluate women's
   priorities and preferences in selecting their obstetrician and
   gynecologist in a non-Western society.
   Methods. Consecutive sample of 508 patients attending the obstetric and
   gynecologic services of AL-Ain Hospital; AL-Ain; United Arab Emirates
   during 4 months was recruited. Participants were interviewed by using a
   structured 26-item questionnaire administered by means of face-to-face
   interview within 24 h of admission in the ward or before consultation in
   the outpatient clinic. Respondents were asked about their preferences,
   priorities, determinants of choice of their obstetrician and
   gynecologist, their view of his/her role as a medical provider, and
   their perception of importance of each of provider's characteristics and
   roles on a five-point Likert scale.
   Results. Four hundred thirty-nine (86.4\%) participants preferred female
   physicians. Sixty-one (12\%) had no preference and eight (1.6\%)
   preferred male physicians. Reasons for female selection were privacy
   during intimate examination (89.1\%) or counseling (68.8\%), religious
   beliefs (74.3\%), and cultural traditions (45.3\%). Female preference
   was significantly associated with higher parity (P = 0.002), religion (P
   = 0.005), nationality (P = 0.01), occupation (P = 0.02), education (P =
   0.04), and poor recognition of physician's role as professional/expert
   (P < 0.00001). Male preference was significantly associated with
   experience at previous encounter (P = 0.03), obstetric consultation (P =
   0.04), and perceiving physician's role as skilled communicator (P =
   0.01) or health educator (P = 0.04). Other physician characteristics
   affecting choice were professionalism, bedside manners, empathy,
   communication, competence, availability, and religion.
   Conclusions. Physician's attitude, professional profile, sex, and
   religious faith determine women's choice of obstetricians and
   gynecologists. Most women prefer female providers because of
   embarrassment during pelvic examination and reproductive counseling,
   religious beliefs, and sociocultural values.}},

Abstract = {{The current health care system in the United States must shift from a

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Professionalism is an important topic in medical education
   today. While much work has focused on defining professionalism and
   teaching medical students the appropriate interpersonal behaviours,
   relatively little research has looked at meaningful ways of assessing
   the relevant attributes.
   METHOD The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates
   (ECFMG(R)) clinical skills assessment (CSA(R)) uses standardised
   patients (SPs) to evaluate the readiness of graduates of international
   medical schools to enter accredited graduate training programmes in the
   USA. Doctor interpersonal skills, including professional qualities such
   as rapport, are evaluated as part of the CSA. Attentiveness, attitude
   and empathy, all facets of professional behaviour, are specifically
   targeted as part of the assessment.
   RESULTS To date, over 35 000 candidates have been assessed, encompassing
   more than 370 000 individual SP encounters. Based on a I-year cohort of
   examinees, the reliability of the individual professionalism-related
   component scores ranged from 0.61 to 0.70. Doctors who had graduated
   from medical school more recently, or were younger, generally obtained
   higher ratings. Professional qualities were only marginally related to
   measures of basic science and clinical science proficiency. Female
   candidates were rated significantly higher than male candidates on all
   dimensions.
   CONCLUSIONS While some professional behaviours are probably best
   measured using formats such as surveys, self-assessment and critical
   incident techniques, certain aspects of the domain can be reliably and
   Validly measured in SP examinations.}},

Journal = {{MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-49}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background. There is interest in the use of ``standardized patients{''}
   to assist in evaluating medical trainees' clinical skills, which may be
   difficult to evaluate with written exams alone. Previous studies of the
   validity of observed structured clinical exams have found low
   correlation with various written exams as well as with faculty
   evaluations. Since die United States Medical Licensing Examination
   (USMLE) results are often used by training programs in the selection of
   applicants. we assessed the correlation between performance on an
   observed structured clinical exam and the USMLE, steps 1 and 2. for
   internal medicine housestaff.
   Methods: We collected scores on the USMLE, steps I and 2, and the
   overall score from a required standardized patient encounter for all
   PGY-1 trainees, in a single urban teaching hospital. Pearson
   coefficients were used to compare the USMILE and observed structured
   clinical exam performance.
   Results: The two steps of the USMLE correlated with each other to a
   large extent (r=0.65 2 df=30: p=0.0001). However. both steps of the
   USMILE correlated poorly with the observed structured clinical exam step
   1 r=0.2, df=32, p=0.27; step 2 r=0.09, df=30 p=0.61).
   Conclusions: The low correlation between the USMLE and performance on a
   structured clinical exam suggests that either the written exam is a poor
   predictor of actual clinical performance, the small window of clinical
   skills measured by the structured clinical exam is inadequate, or the
   two methods evaluate different skill sets entirely. Our findings are
   consistent with previous work finding low correlations between
   structured clinical exams and accepted common means of evaluation. such
   as faculty evaluations. other written exams and program director
   assessments. The medical education community needs to develop an
   objective. valid method of measuring important, yet subjective,
   skill-sets such as interpersonal communication, empathy and efficient
   data collection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The attitudes of health-care professionals and medical
   students towards male and female homosexuality are of practical
   relevance and have increasingly become a topic of scientific research.
   Comparative investigations between medical students and other student
   groups have not yet been conducted.
   Objectives: To assess the attitudes of Austrian medical students towards
   homosexuality and to compare these with the attitudes of students of
   politics and veterinary medicine.
   Methods: Students of medicine (122), politics (145), and veterinary
   medicine (153) completed a questionnaire consisting of validated
   instruments assessing anti-homosexual attitudes, items assessing
   knowledge on homosexual issues, and basic demographic information.
   Results: Participants' attitudes were predominantly positive. For all
   instruments, two-way analyses of covariance revealed significant
   influences of participants' sex and study major: students of medicine
   and veterinary medicine held more negative attitudes than students of
   politics, and males were more prejudiced than females. Overall,
   attitudes towards male and female homosexuality were balanced, but male
   students of politics and veterinary medicine were more prejudiced
   towards male than female homosexuality. A significant influence of
   participants' sex (favoring females) was observed in knowledge of
   homosexual issues.
   Conclusions: Although neutrality and empathy are considered vital in the
   doctor-patient relationship, medical students revealed more negative
   attitudes than students of politics did, the latter's attitudes being
   similar to those of students of veterinary medicine. These findings
   suggest that educational and correcting interventions are required in
   medical training.}},

Abstract = {{Southern Illinois University School of Medicine recently completed its
   fourth year of a resource-session-enhanced, case-based,
   tutor-group-oriented curriculum. As an example of a curricular unit, the
   authors describe the implementation of the basic and clinical sciences
   in one of the four units in year one, and detail that unit's
   organization, logistics, content, rationale, and other characteristics.
   The Sensorimotor Systems and Behavior (SSB) unit is preceded by a
   cardio-respiratory-renal unit and is followed by an
   endocrine-reproductive-gastrointestinal unit. A Doctoring unit
   temporally spans each of these three units. The SSB unit is allotted an
   11.5-week period that includes an aggregate of 2.5 weeks of available
   clinical time, 1.5 weeks for examinations and exam study time, and
   approximately 8.5 weeks for tutor-group sessions, mandatory laboratory
   sessions, and self-directed learning. Optional resource sessions are
   offered during a two- to four-hour block on a single morning each week.
   Clinical training in the SSB unit augments self-directed, laboratory,
   and tutor-group learning of neuroscience, gross anatomy, cell biology,
   physiology, biochemistry, behavioral and social science, embryology,
   limited pharmacology and genetics, and basic clinical neurology for
   first-year students. Although it is fast-paced and places heavy
   responsibility for independent learning on the students, the SSB unit
   culminates in significant achievement in the basic and clinical
   sciences. The unit provides substantial clinical training and practical
   experience in physical and neurological examinations that directly
   integrate with basic science knowledge. The unit reduces lecture-based
   instruction, demands self-determination, and promotes experience in team
   effort, professionalism, peer interaction, empathy in clinical medicine,
   and practical use of basic science knowledge.}},

Title = {{The biopsychosocial model 25 years later: Principles, practice, and

Abstract = {{The biopsychosocial model is both a philosophy of clinical care and a
   practical clinical guide. Philosophically, it is a way of understanding
   how suffering, disease, and illness are affected by multiple levels of
   organization, from the societal to the molecular. At the practical
   level, it is a way of understanding the patient's subjective experience
   as an essential contributor to accurate diagnosis, health outcomes, and
   humane care. In this article, we defend the biopsychosocial model as a
   necessary contribution to the scientific clinical method, while
   suggesting 3 clarifications: (1) the relationship between mental and
   physical aspects of health is complex-subjective experience depends on
   but is not reducible to laws of physiology; (2) models of circular
   causality must be tempered by linear approximations when considering
   treatment options; and (3) promoting a more participatory
   clinician-patient relationship is in keeping with current Western
   cultural tendencies, but may not be universally accepted. We propose a
   biopsychosocial-oriented clinical practice whose pillars include (1)
   self-awareness; (2) active cultivation of trust; (3) an emotional style
   characterized by empathic curiosity; (4) self-calibration as a way to
   reduce bias; (5) educating the emotions to assist with diagnosis and
   forming therapeutic relationships; (6) using informed intuition; and (7)
   communicating clinical evidence to foster dialogue, not just the
   mechanical application of protocol. In conclusion, the value of the
   biopsychosocial model has not been in the discovery of new scientific
   laws, as the term ``new paradigm{''} would suggest, but rather in
   guiding parsimonious application of medical knowledge to the needs of
   each patient.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the factors affecting the
   timing of psychiatric consultations and length of stay in the current
   managed care era. It also assessed the relationships between the timing
   of consultations and demographic/clinical characteristics. Medical
   records of 541 consecutive psychiatric consultation patients at a
   university teaching hospital in 2001 were reviewed for demographic
   characteristics, lengths of stay, number of days from admission to
   consultation, specialty services requesting consultations, reasons for
   the referral given by the referring physicians, and all five axes of
   DSM-IV Earlier consultations independently predicted shorter lengths of
   stay. Delayed consultations were seen more often in women; surgical
   patients; those seen with a request to assess depression; and those seen
   with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder delirium, or no psychiatric
   disorder Delay in psychiatric consultations continues to be associated
   with longer lengths of stay in the current managed care environment. It
   is now possible that early detection strategies for high-risk patients
   with behavioral health problems in the medical setting, such as use of
   the INTERMED, may lead to reduction in delayed psychiatric consultations
   and thus shorter lengths of stay.}},

Journal = {{TRANSFUSION}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1648-1655}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify factors that
   predict overall hospital satisfaction with blood suppliers.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The data for this study came from a 2001
   satisfaction survey of hospital blood bank managers conducted by the
   National Blood Data Resource Center. A total of 1325 blood-utilizing
   hospitals were included in the final study database. The measurement of
   hospital satisfaction with its blood supplier encompasses the five
   composites of the SERVQUAL model. The five composites are 1) tangibles,
   2) reliability, 3) responsiveness, 4) assurance, and 5) empathy. Linear
   regression was performed with overall hospital satisfaction as the
   dependent variable and the five composites of the SERVQUAL model and
   control variables as predictors of overall hospital satisfaction with
   blood suppliers.
   RESULTS: Significant predictors of hospital satisfaction with blood
   suppliers are satisfaction with medical and clinical support provided by
   the blood center, satisfaction with the routine delivery schedule, and
   price (service fee) of red cells.
   CONCLUSION: Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of customer
   satisfaction to organizations. As organizations, blood centers can
   benefit from improved satisfaction from their hospital customers. Blood
   center strategies that focus on improving these three predictors of
   overall hospital satisfaction with primary blood suppliers will be the
   most likely to improve and/or maintain hospital customer satisfaction
   with primary blood suppliers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{898-908}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a problem in older women,
   but older victims of IPV are often unidentified in the medical setting
   because providers think of IPV as a problem of younger women. The
   experiences of older women with IPV are unknown. This study reports on
   the healthcare experiences and needs of older victims of IPV.
   Methods: Interviews were conducted with 38 women > 55 years who
   responded to an advertisement recruiting ``women who had been in an
   abusive relationship since age 55.{''} Interviews were audiotaped,
   transcribed, and analyzed for themes.
   Results: The median age of participants was 58 years ( range 55 - 90).
   The majority were Caucasian with annual incomes over \$40,000. The
   median relationship length was 24 years ( range 2 - 67), and 39\%
   remained in their abusive relationships. About half had discussed IPV
   with a healthcare provider. The themes that were identified included
   disclosure about IPV and both negative and positive experiences with
   healthcare providers. Reasons for nondisclosure were similar to those of
   younger women but were compounded by the generational mores of privacy
   about domestic affairs and society's lack of understanding and resources
   for IPV. Some of the women who disclosed IPV to their providers felt
   discounted and unsupported. Others reported receiving valuable help,
   including empathy, referrals to resources, assistance in naming the
   abuse, linking the stress of IPV to health, and respect for their
   decisions to continue their abusive relationships.
   Conclusions: Older women victims have difficulty initiating discussions
   about IPV with their providers. Providers are encouraged to identify
   signals of potential abuse and to create privacy with all patients to
   discuss difficult issues, such as IPV, and to be knowledgeable about
   appropriate referrals.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{832-839}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The ability of medical students to empathize often declines as they
   progress through the curriculum. This suggests that there is a need to
   promote empathy toward patients during the clinical clerkships. In this
   article, the authors attempt to identify the patient interviewing style
   that facilitates empathy and some practice habits that interfere with
   it.
   The authors maintain that (1) empathy is a multistep process whereby the
   doctor's awareness of the patient's concerns produces a sequence of
   emotional engagement, compassion, and an urge to help the patient; and
   (2) the first step in this process-the detection of the patient's
   concerns-is a teachable skill. The authors suggest that this step is
   facilitated by (1) conducting a ``patient-centered{''} interview,
   thereby creating an atmosphere that encourages patients to share their
   concerns, (2) enquiring further into these concerns, and (3) recording
   them in the section traditionally reserved for the patient's ``chief
   complaint.{''} Some practice habits may discourage patients from sharing
   their concerns, such as (1) writing up the history during patient
   interviewing, (2) focusing too early on the chief complaint, and (3)
   performing a complete system review. The authors conclude that
   sustaining empathy and promoting medical professionalism among medical
   students may necessitate a change in the prevailing interviewing style
   in all clinical teaching settings, and a relocation of a larger
   proportion of clinical clerkships from the hospital setting to primary
   care clinics and chronic care, home care, and hospice facilities, where
   students can establish a continuing relationship with patients.}},

Abstract = {{Breaking the news of the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   (ALS) is a formidable task. To evaluate the process from the perspective
   of patients and caregivers, we surveyed 94 patient-caregiver pairs, as
   well as 50 unpaired patients and 19 unpaired caregivers. We asked
   respondents to evaluate the physician who first broke the news of the
   diagnosis based on the time spent discussing the diagnosis, and six
   attributes of effective communication of bad news derived from the
   SPIKES protocol ( setting, perception, invitation, knowledge, empathy,
   strategy). Fifty-six percent of patients rated the way the physician who
   broke the news as average (30.7), below average (8.6) or poor (16.4).
   Forty-eight percent of caregivers rated the physician as poor (14.4),
   below average (4.8) or average (28.8). Better performance on all
   attributes of effective communication as well as greater time spent
   discussing the diagnosis was correlated with higher patient/caregiver
   satisfaction. Our results suggest that there is room for improvement in
   breaking the news of the diagnosis of ALS. Greater adherence to certain
   attributes of effective communication of bad news may improve the way
   physicians perform this difficult task.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Medical students face many challenges as they progress
   through training, some of which refer to learning how to manage the
   stresses and anxiety of confronting illness and suffering. In trying to
   relieve anxiety, they may develop maladaptive responses that lead to a
   decrease in their level of empathy for patients. Education should aim to
   teach students how to deal with their responses so that they can
   tolerate patients' distress and treat them effectively.
   AIMS This paper will address central dilemmas in students' attitudes
   towards patients during clerkships and suggest positive developmental
   goals to strive for in this formative time. It may be used as a
   reference tool for medical student educators and medical students to
   elucidate the educational tensions in teaching and learning about how to
   provide empathetic care.
   CONCLUSION Students and teachers can benefit from an awareness of the
   tension between the poles of pathology and health, not knowing and too
   much knowing, vulnerability and denial and reaction and inaction.
   Medical students can learn adaptive methods of managing their anxiety
   about dealing with illness and death and strike a balance in their
   approach to patients.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT It has been reported that medical students become more cynical
   as they progress through medical school. This can lead to a decline in
   empathy. Empirical research to address this issue is scarce because the
   definition of empathy lacks clarity, and a tool to measure empathy
   specifically in medical students and doctors has been unavailable.
   OBJECTIVE To examine changes in empathy among medical students as they
   progress through medical school.
   MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS A newly developed scale (Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy {[}JSPE], with 20 Likert-type items) was administered
   to 125 medical students at the beginning (pretest) and end (post-test)
   of Year 3 of medical school. This scale was specifically developed for
   measuring empathy in patient care situations and has acceptable
   psychometric properties.
   METHODS In this prospective longitudinal study, the changes in
   pretest/post-test empathy scores were examined by using t-test for
   repeated measure design; the effect size estimates were also calculated.
   RESULTS Statistically significant declines were observed in 5 items (P <
   0.01) and the total sores of the JSPE (P < 0.05) between the 2 test
   administrations.
   CONCLUSIONS Although the decline in empathy was not clinically important
   for all of the statistically significant findings, the downward trend
   suggests that empathy could be amenable to change during medical school.
   Further research is needed to identify factors that contribute to
   changes in empathy and to examine whether targeted educational
   programmes can help to retain, reinforce and cultivate empathy among
   medical students for improving clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to validate the model of empathic
   opportunity (EO) and potential empathic opportunity (PEO) using the
   Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) in a sample of cancer patients.
   Thirty-nine audio taped consultations at an outpatient oncology clinic
   performed by four oncologists were previously coded with the Roter
   Interaction Analysis System for another purpose. These consultations
   were also coded by two raters with the empathic and potential empathic
   opportunity method (E-PE-O method). The reliability of EO and PEO coding
   was satisfactory. Most of the EOs were found within the RIAS category
   ``showing concern{''}. The PEOs were found in both the socio-emotional
   and the instrumental categories of the RIAS. We conclude that the E-PE-O
   method is a good starting point for studying the empathy process in
   oncology consultations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Do global rating forms enable program directors to assess the ACGME
   competencies?}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2004}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. In 1999 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
   Education (ACGME) mandated that GME programs require their residents to
   be proficient in six general competencies. The purpose of this study was
   to ascertain whether an existing global rating form could be modified to
   assess these competencies.
   Method. A rating form covering 23 skills described in the ACGME
   competencies was developed. The directors of 92 specialty and
   subspecialty programs at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and the
   Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia were asked to rate
   residents at the end of the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years.
   Results. Ratings for 1,295 of 1,367 (95\%) residents were available.
   Residents were awarded the highest mean ratings on items tied to
   professionalism, compassion, and empathy. The lowest mean ratings were
   assigned for items related to consideration of costs in care and
   management of resources. Factor analysis indicated that the program
   directors viewed overall competence in two dimensions of medical
   knowledge and interpersonal skills. This factor structure was stable for
   groups of specialties, and residents' gender and training level. Mean
   ratings in each dimension were progressively higher for residents at
   advanced levels of training.
   Conclusion. Global rating forms, the tool that program directors use
   most frequently to document residents' competence, may not be adequate
   to assess the six general competencies. The results are consistent with
   earlier published research indicating that physicians view competence in
   just two broad dimensions, which questions the premise of the six ACGME
   competencies. Further research is needed to validate and measure six
   distinct dimensions of clinical competence.}},
