Abstract = {{Background: Due to technical advances and progressive specialization,
   patient physician relationship evolved from being based on confidence
   and comprehension to be impersonal and contractual. Aim: To evaluate the
   change produced in medical students' concept of the meaning of disease,
   afer living an experience of accompanying a patient and their family
   environment. Material and methods: We used a qualitative research
   methodology based on participative-action to evaluate an educational
   method in which a group of third year medical students accompanied a
   previously selected chronic patient during two months. We performed two
   focal groups, one previous to the experience and the second one a month
   later. Additionally, every student wrote a personal narration of the
   experience. We compared the students' perception of the meaning of
   disease for the patients and their relatives, before and after the
   experience. Results: The students confirmed their previous conception
   about chronic disease, but they also discovered the ways in which some
   patients and their families overcome their limitations. They pointed out
   their belief that the physician's comprehension of the meaning of
   disease for the patient and the family, a need to practice a good
   medicine and that this knowledge change the physician-patient
   relationship. Conclusions: This experience was an effective way of
   learning the meaning of disease, which might be a part of medical
   student' training, with the corresponding adjustments and changes.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural competence in oncology requires the acquisition of specific
   knowledge, clinical skills, and attitudes that facilitate effective
   cross-cultural negotiation in the clinical setting, thus, leading to
   improved therapeutic outcomes and decreased disparities in cancer care.
   Cultural competence in oncology entails a basic knowledge of different
   cultural attitudes and practices of communication of the truth and of
   decision-making styles throughout the world. Cultural competence always
   presupposes oncology professionals' awareness of their own cultural
   beliefs and values. To be able to communicate with cancer patients in
   culturally sensitive ways, oncologists should have knowledge of the
   concept of culture in its complexity and of the risks of racism,
   classism, sexism, ageism, and stereotyping that must be avoided in
   clinical practice. Oncologists should develop a sense of appreciation
   for differences in health care values, based on the recognition that no
   culture can claim hegemony over others and that cultures are evolving
   under their reciprocal influence on each other. Medical schools and
   oncology training can teach communication skills and cultural
   competence, while fostering in all students and young doctors those
   attitudes of humility, empathy, curiosity, respect, sensitivity, and
   awareness that are needed to deliver effective and culturally sensitive
   cancer care.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of obesity is increasing in both developed and developing
   countries, with rates reaching similar to 10-35\%, among adults in the
   Euro-American region. Obesity is associated with increased risks of
   cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and some type of
   cancers. Obesity significantly affects the quality of life and reduces
   the average life expectancy. The effective treatment of obesity should
   address both the medical and the social burden of this disease. Obesity
   needs to he treated within the health care system as any other complex
   disease, with empathy and Without prejudice. Both health care providers
   and patient,; should know that the obesity treatment is a lifelong task.
   They should also Set realistic goals before starting the treatment,
   whereas keeping in mind that even a modest weight loss of 5-15\%
   significantly reduces obesity-related health risks. Essential treatment
   of obesity includes low-calorie low-fat diets, increased physical
   activity, and strategies contributing to the modification of lifestyle.
   Anti-obesity drugs facilitate weight loss and contribute to further
   amelioration of obesity-related health risks. A short-term weight loss,
   up to 6 months, is usually achieved easily. However, the long-term
   weight management is often associated with a lack of compliance,
   failures, and a high dropout rate. Regular physical activity, cognitive
   behavioral modification of lifestyle, and administration of anti-obesity
   drugs improve weight loss maintenance. Bariatric surgery is an effective
   strategy to treat severely obese patients. Bariatric surgery leads to a
   substantial improvement of comorbidities as well as to a reduction in
   overall mortality by 25-50\% during the long-term follow-up. Obesity
   treatment should be individually tailored and the. following factors
   should be taken into account: sex, the degree of obesity, individual
   health risks, psychobehavioral and metabolic characteristics, and the
   outcome of previous weight loss attempts. In the future, ail evaluation
   of hormonal and genetic determinants of weight loss could also
   contribute to a better choice of individual therapy for a particular
   obese patient. A multilevel obesity management network of mutually
   collaborating facilities should he established to provide individually
   tailored treatment. Centers of excellence in obesity management
   represented by multidisciplinary teams should provide comprehensive
   programs for the treatment of obesity derived from evidence-based
   medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the impact of the Patient Empathy Modeling
   pedagogy on students' empathy towards caring for the underserved during
   an advanced pharmacy practice experience ( APPE).
   Design
   Pharmacy students completing an APPE at 2 primary care clinics
   participated in a Patient Empathy Modeling assignment for 10 days. Each
   student ``became the patient,{''} simulating the life of an actual
   patient with multiple chronic diseases who was coping with an economic,
   cultural, or communication barrier to optimal healthcare. Students
   completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy ( JSPE) before and
   after completing the assignment, and wrote daily journal entries and a
   reflection paper.
   Assessment
   Twenty-six students completed the PEM exercises from 2005-2006. Scores
   on the JSPE improved. Students' comments in journals and reflection
   papers revealed 3 major themes: greater appreciation of the difficulty
   patients have with adherence to medication and treatment regimens,
   increased empathy for patients from different backgrounds and patients
   with medical and psychosocial challenges, and improved ability to apply
   the lessons learned in the course to their patient care roles.
   Conclusion
   A Patient Empathy Modeling assignment improved pharmacy students'
   empathy toward underserved populations. Integrating the assignment
   within an APPE allowed students to immediately begin applying the
   knowledge and insight gained from the exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Higher education is growing fast and every day it becomes
   more and more exposed to globalization processes. The aim of this study
   was to determine the quality gap of educational services by using a
   modified SERVQUAL instrument among students in Hormozgan University of
   Medical Sciences.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at Hormozgan University
   of Medical Sciences in 2007. In this study, a total of 300 students were
   selected randomly and asked to complete a questionnaire that was
   designed according to SERVQUAL methods. This questionnaire measured
   students' perceptions and expectations in five dimensions of service
   that consists of assurance, responsiveness, empathy, reliability and
   tangibles. The quality gap of educational services was determined based
   on differences between students' perceptions and expectations.
   Results: The results demonstrated that in each of the five SERVQUAL
   dimensions, there was a negative quality gap. The least and the most
   negative quality gap means were in the reliability (-0.71) and
   responsiveness (-1.14) dimensions respectively. Also, there were
   significant differences between perceptions and expectations of students
   in all of the five SERVQUAL dimensions ( p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Negative quality gaps mean students' expectations exceed
   their perceptions. Thus, improvements are needed across all five
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to examine parent-reported
   experiences in the health care system after receiving the prenatal
   diagnosis of trisomy 18 and to identify factors that contribute to

   interviews. Of the 19 families, 11 continued the pregnancy while the
   remaining 8 chose induced abortion. Classical content analysis was
   utilized to identify themes among subject responses. Result: We
   identified several specific aspects of care as key in either being
   highly satisfied or dissatisfied: expressions of empathy from provider,
   continuity of care, communication, valuing the fetus and participation
   in medical decision-making. Conclusions: Aspects of care that were
   identified as reasons for dissatisfaction are potentially modifiable by
   training, education or team-based approaches. Further studies are
   necessary to determine how we can improve the quality of services during

   each evaluation format was perceived to assess each of 8 competencies
   derived primarily from the General Medical Council document Good Medical
   Practice.
   RESULTS There were high levels of agreement among stakeholders regarding
   the perceived qualities tested by the proposed formats (G = 0.82-0.93).
   Differences were found in participants' perceptions of how well
   qualities were able to be assessed and in the ability of the respective
   formats to test each quality. Multi-source feedback (MSF) was expected
   to assess a wide range of qualities, whereas Probity, Health and Ability
   to work with colleagues were limited in terms of how well they could be
   tested by the proposed formats.
   DISCUSSION Awareness of the perceptions of stakeholders should
   facilitate the development and implementation of workplace-based
   assessment (WPBA) systems. These data shed light on the acceptability of
   various formats in a way that will inform further investigation of WPBA
   formats' validity and feasibility, while also providing evidence on
   which to base educational efforts regarding the value of each format.}},

Title = {{The wounding path to becoming healers: medical students' apprenticeship
   experiences}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{260-264}},
Abstract = {{Background: This article responds to repeated calls in the literature to
   teach medical students how to treat the whole patient, not just the
   disease. It focuses on the educational experiences of medical students
   in a Canadian university in an effort to clarify the determinants of
   caring in medical education.
   Method: Nineteen (19) second-year medical students volunteered to keep
   weekly journal entries during the first five months of their medical
   apprenticeship. In journal entry analyses, the authors identified themes
   through a consensus-building coding process detailed in the work of
   Maykut and Morehouse (1994) and Huckin (2004). For this article, the
   authors focus on those themes most closely related to the students'
   caring experiences during their apprenticeship.
   Results: The data highlight components of the medical system which made
   it difficult for students to engage in caring practices during their
   apprenticeship: the competing discourses of empathy and efficiency, the
   objectification of patients, the power of the medical hierarchy, and the
   institutionalized practice of wounding.
   Conclusion: The authors argue that returning medical care and students'
   experience to a balance of attention to curing and caring is a complex
   undertaking requiring a re-conceptualization of the process and goals of
   medical care.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: We wanted to explore cognitive and affective attitudes towards
   communication skills among students in Norwegian medical schools.
   Method: 1833 (60\% response rate) medical students at the four medical
   schools in Norway filled in questionnaires by the end of term in May
   2003. The Communication Skills Attitudes Scale (CSAS) was used for
   assessing affective and cognitive attitudes separately.
   Results and conclusions: Medical students have positive attitudes
   towards learning and using communication skills. Cognitive and affective
   attitudes displayed different patterns. Being female and having worked
   in the health services before admission to the medical school predicted
   more positive scores both towards cognitive and affective attitudes.
   Having worked as a junior doctor during medical school predicted more
   positive cognitive attitudes. Cognitive attitudes towards communication
   skills did not vary significantly between year groups in any of the
   medical schools. Scores reflecting affective attitudes gradually fell
   for each year in all schools, but rose again in the final year in two of
   them. Implications for curriculum design are discussed.}},

Title = {{Assessment of professionalism in undergraduate medical students}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-286}},
Abstract = {{Background: Professionalism is comprised of a set of values and
   behaviours that underpin the social contract between the public and the
   medical profession. Medical errors are reported to result in significant
   morbidity and mortality and are in-part related to underdeveloped
   professionalism.
   Aims: The aim was to determine whether specific aspects of
   professionalism were underdeveloped in medical students.
   Method: A questionnaire with 24 vignettes was taken by Year 2, 4, and 6
   medical students and their responses were compared to responses from
   practicing Medical Academics.
   Results: Second, fourth and sixth Year medical students' responses
   differed from Academics in two aspects of professionalism, firstly, high
   ethical and moral standards and secondly, humanistic values such as
   integrity and honesty. Only Year 2 medical students' responses were
   different from Academics when it came to responsibility and
   accountability.
   Conclusions: Certain aspects of professionalism seem to be
   underdeveloped in medical students. These aspects of professionalism may
   need to be targeted for teaching and assessment in order that students
   develop as professionally responsible practitioners. In turn, students
   with well-developed professionalism may be less involved in medical
   error, and if involved they may have the personal values which can help
   them deal with error more honestly and effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is a skill that can be acquired by practise and
   should become a habit.
   Aims: Assess the impact of a communication skills workshop on the
   empathy level of medical students and medical residents.
   Methods: Quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test study. Empathy level was
   assessed in 203 subjects using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE), divided in two groups: one control group, and other experimental
   group that participated in an activity consisting of a 25-hour
   theoretical/practical workshop on communication and empathy.
   Results: The mean pre-workshop JSPE score was similar in both groups.
   Post-workshop JSPE score increased 5.24 points (95 CI 3.82-7.09)
   (P<0.0001) in the experimental group, improving in 68.9\% of
   participants. No significant increase in JSPE score after the second
   assessment was observed in the controls. For this difference the
   estimated effect size was 0.78.
   Conclusions: A communication skills workshop yields a slight improvement
   of crucial practice importance in subjects' empathy.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{400-406}},
Abstract = {{Background: Research on the relationship between personality and
   specialty interest is important because of its implications in student
   career counseling and in forecasting future specialty distribution.
   Aim: This study was designed to test the following hypotheses: 1.
   Students interested in `surgical' specialties would obtain higher scores
   on a measure of `impulsive sensation seeking' and lower scores on a
   measure of `neuroticism-anxiety'. 2. Students interested in
   `hospital-based' specialties would score lower on a measure of
   `sociability' whereas those interested in `primary care' would score
   higher on this measure. In addition to these two hypotheses, gender
   differences on personality were also examined.
   Method: Study participants were 1,076 students who matriculated at
   Jefferson Medical College between 2002 to 2006. A short version of the
   Zuckerman-Kuhlman personality questionnaire (ZKPQ) measuring five
   personality factors of `impulsive sensation Seeking',
   `neuroticism-anxiety', `aggression-hostility', `sociability', and
   `activity' was completed by research participants at the beginning of
   medical school. Students were also asked to note their specialty
   interests. Results: Multivariate statistical analyses confirmed the
   first and partially confirmed the second research hypotheses.
   Results also showed that men scored higher on `impulsive sensation
   seeking,' and women outscored men in the `neuroticism-Anxiety' and
   `activity' scales.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that information about the personalities
   of medical students can help to predict their career interests.
   Implications for career counseling are discussed.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{E228-E238}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical students need to learn how to recognize and manage
   critically ill patients; to communicate in critical situations with
   patients, families, and the healthcare team; and finally, to integrate
   technical knowledge with communication skills in caring for these
   patients. Meeting their needs will help prepare them to demonstrate, as
   physicians, the ability to synthesize information while simultaneously
   caring for patients, that the American Medical Association recently
   characterized as vital. Aims: Responding to these needs, we developed
   and implemented a curriculum to enable students in a required emergency
   medicine clerkship to recognize, manage, and simultaneously communicate
   with critically ill patients. Methods: The curriculum consisted of
   lectures and exercises on caring for the critically ill including: an
   introduction to the systematic approach; an interactive lecture on
   comprehensive communication; observation and discussion of real patients
   in the emergency department; participation in a single standardized
   patient encounter while peers and a faculty member observed them;
   assessment of students' own videotaped performance of the examination by
   using critical care and communication/interpersonal skills checklists;
   and receipt of private feedback based on the checklists from the faculty
   and the standardized patient. Students evaluated the curriculum at the
   end of the clerkship. Results: Complete performance data for 46 students
   and curriculum evaluation data from 42 students were available.
   According to faculty assessment, students as a group performed 79.6\%
   (SD 0.15) of the critical care and 70.9\% (SD 11.5\%) of the
   communication skills. Students most often demonstrated Basic
   Interpersonal Skills (97.9\%, SD 0.056) and least often demonstrated
   Empathy skills (41.7\%, SD 0.235). Students rated the curriculum
   positively. Conclusions: It is feasible to integrate the teaching of
   communication skills with the recognition and management of critically
   ill patients. The next step will be to revise the curriculum to address
   student deficiencies and to evaluate its effectiveness more rigorously.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{E208-E217}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical regulatory organizations worldwide require
   competency in communication skills. Pediatric communication competencies
   are unique, and little is known about pediatric residents' perceptions
   regarding these skills.
   Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine pediatric residents'
   attitudes about communication skills, their perceptions of the
   importance of learning 15 specific communication skills relevant to
   pediatrics, confidence in these skills, and relevant program supports.
   Methods: We developed a 47-item cross-sectional questionnaire to study
   pediatric residents' attitudes and perceptions regarding communication
   competencies. 104 pediatric housestaff in a university-affiliated
   program in the US were asked to complete the questionnaire. Scale
   variables were created and evaluated for reliability. Data were analysed
   using descriptive and univariate statistics.
   Results: Response rate was 86\% (89/104). Cronbach's alpha reliabilities
   of the Importance Scale (r = 0.92) and Confidence Scale (r = 0.90) were
   excellent. Ninety nine percent of the participants agreed that learning
   to communicate effectively with patients was a priority. All agreed it
   is important to demonstrate empathy and caring, and to teach medical
   students to communicate effectively with patients. Pediatric residents
   agreed that the 15 communication competencies studied were important to
   learn. Most reported confidence in core communication competencies
   (interviewing, listening, building rapport, demonstrating caring and
   empathy), but only half or fewer were confident in 7 more advanced
   communication skills (ability to discuss end-of-life issues, speaking
   with children about serious illness, giving bad news, dealing with the
   `difficult' patient/parent, cultural awareness/sensitivity,
   understanding psychosocial aspects, and understanding patients'
   perspectives). Few reported the availability of relevant program
   supports for learning these skills.
   Conclusions: Pediatric residents perceive communication competencies as
   important and a priority for learning, yet report a lack of confidence
   in advanced communication skills and insufficient program supports. Our
   measurement scales can add to the evaluation of residency programs, and
   may provide suggestions for pediatric curricular content in core and
   advanced communication skills.}},

Abstract = {{Regardless of the treatment regimens and ongoing research we do as
   medical doctors and scientists, our bottom line is to improve the lives
   of those suffering from pancreatic cancer; certainly not an easy
   undertaking. In a previous issue of Pancreatology (April 2008, vol. 8),
   our editor discussed the importance of empathy toward our patients. In
   reflecting on the mission of trying to accomplish this goal, it is the
   patients, themselves, and their families who can offer the best insight
   into the quality of life of the patient. In this issue, the focus is on
   pancreatic cancer patients and their families who have formed
   foundations and websites toward the cause. Their insight should be
   valued not only for the support group they form for other patients but
   for medical doctors and researchers as well. In addition, their advocacy
   for this devastating disease is essential to our mission both in their
   generosity with funding and in their voices to our governments for more
   national funding in this area. The human factor should never be erased

Abstract = {{Objective: The physician-caregiver relationship affects patients' health
   outcomes, but measures of this important relationship are lacking. We
   develop and validate the physician-caregiver relationship scales (PCRS),
   incorporating three relationship domains (liking, understanding,
   dominance).
   Methods: Videotapes of 100 children's visits were coded for verbal and
   nonverbal communication. Roter interaction analysis system utterance
   categories (personal remarks, laughter, agreements, approvals, concerns,
   reassurances, back channels and empathy) and summary measures (physician
   proportion of total talk and of number of questions) along with
   nonverbal measures (touch initiations, upright postures and leaning
   toward a participant) were used as indicators. Model fit was evaluated
   with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Validity was evaluated by
   associations of the PCRS with visit characteristics and global affect
   ratings.
   Results: PCRS domains incorporating verbal and nonverbal indicators
   demonstrated good model fit (RMSEA < 0.05; SRMR < 0.12; TLI and CFI >
   0.95). Construct and predictive validity were demonstrated with PCRS
   domains relating to visit characteristics and affect ratings as
   predicted.
   Conclusions: CFA supported the multi-dimensional PCRS with three
   domains-liking, understanding and dominance. Such measures are valuable
   tools for investigations of physician-caregiver relationships.
   Practice implications: Models suggest specific indicators of the
   physician-caregiver relationship and inform interventions to improve
   these relationships. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Evidence of the beneficial effects of longer consultations in general
   practice is limited.
   Aim
   To evaluate the effect of increasing consultation length on patient
   enablement in general practice in an area of extreme socioeconomic
   deprivation.
   Design of study
   Longitudinal study using a `before and after' design.
   Setting
   Keppoch Medical Centre in Glasgow, which serves the most deprived
   practice area in Scotland.
   Method
   Participants were 300 adult patients at baseline, before the
   introduction of longer consultations, and 324 at follow-up, more than 1
   year after the introduction of longer consultations. The intervention
   studied was more time in complex consultations. Patient satisfaction,
   perceptions of the GPs' empathy, GP stress, and patient enablement were
   collected by face-to-face interview. Additional qualitative data were
   obtained by individual interviews with the GPs, relating to their
   perceptions of the impact of the longer consultations.
   Results
   Response rates of 70\% were obtained. Overall, 53\% of consultations
   were complex. GP stress was higher in complex consultations. Patient
   satisfaction and perception of the GPs' empathy were consistently high.
   Average consultation length in complex consultations was increased by
   2.5 minutes by the intervention. GP stress in consultations was
   decreased after the introduction of longer consultations, and patient
   enablement was increased. GPs' views endorsed these findings, with more
   anticipatory and coordinated care being possible in the longer
   consultations.
   Conclusion
   More resource to provide more time in complex consultations in an area
   of extreme deprivation is associated with an increase in patient
   enablement.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preterm delivery followed by the loss of the preterm child
   is a stressful event for parents and is frequently associated with
   psychological distress or even psychiatric morbidity. Little is known as
   yet about the factors which help parents to cope. The aim of this study
   was to analyze the most helpful factors for parents during the period of
   delivery and the death of the child.
   Methods: At 2-6 years after the death of their premature child (22-26
   gestational week) 26 mothers (M) and 25 fathers (F) answered questions
   on what helped them most to come to terms with the death of their
   premature child. The answers were analyzed by means of qualitative
   content analysis.
   Results: Content analysis highlighted four factors felt to be helpful:
   about 1/3 of the persons questioned (M=33.6\%, F=34.7\%) considered good
   social support to be very helpful. Mothers felt that their personal
   coping abilities were also very important and mentioned them
   significantly more often compared to fathers (M=32.7\%, F=25.3\%).
   Professional support by the hospital staff was found to be another
   helpful factor and was cited more often by fathers than by mothers
   (M=21.5\%, F=29.3\%). Support by staff in this context did not only
   refer to medical support but also to empathy and sympathy offered by
   staff and the manner in which this was communicated. The fourth factor
   found to be relevant was the existence of other children or the birth of
   a further child after the loss (M = 12.2\%, F = 10.7 \%).
   Conclusions: Good social support appears to be the most important factor
   helping parents to cope successfully with the loss of their preterm
   child. Professional support by hospital staff was found to be a very
   important factor for fathers in helping them to cope with the death of
   their child. In clinical practice, therefore, special attention should
   be paid to the communication skills of hospital staff.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to explore
   patient- and physician-specific determinants of physician empathy (PE)
   and to analyse the influence of PE on patient-reported long-term
   outcomes in German cancer patients.
   Methods: A postal survey was administered to 710 cancer patients, who
   had been inpatients at the University Hospital Cologne (response rate
   49.5\%). PE was measured with the German translation of the consultation
   and relational empathy (CARE) measure, and patient-reported long-term
   outcomes were assessed using the major (ICD-10) depression inventory
   (MDI) and the EORTC quality of life (Qo1) questionnaire QLQ-C30.
   Hypotheses were tested by structural equation modelling.
   Results: PE had (a) a moderate indirect effect on ``depression{''} and a
   smaller indirect effect on ``socio-emotional-cognitive Qo1{''} by
   affecting ``desire for more information from the physician regarding
   findings and treatment options{''} and (b) a moderate indirect effect on
   ``socio-emotional-cognitive Qo1{''} and a smaller effect on
   ``depression{''} via ``desire for more information about health
   promotion{''}. The determinant with the greatest importance was
   ``patient-perceived general busyness of hospital staff{''}: it had a
   strong negative influence on PE, indirectly influencing ``desire for
   more information from the physician regarding findings and treatment
   options{''} and also patients' ``depression{''}.
   Conclusion: PE seems to be an important pre-requisite for information
   giving by physicians and through this pathway having a preventive effect
   on depression and improving Qo1. Conversely, physicians' stress
   negatively influences these relationships.
   Practice implications: The research findings suggest that reducing
   physicians' stress at the organizational and individual may be required
   to enhance patient-physician communication. Empathy, as an
   outcome-relevant professional competence needs to be assessed and
   developed more intensively in medical students and physicians. (c) 2007

Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The present study has been designed to test for the effect of
   physicians' gender on the perception and assessment of empathic
   communication in medical encounters.
   Methods: Eighty-eight volunteers were asked to assess six transcribed
   interactions between physicians and a standardized patient. The effects
   of physicians' gender were tested by the experimental manipulation of
   physicians' gender labels in transcripts. Participants were randomly
   assigned to one of two testing conditions: (1) perceived gender
   corresponds to the physician's true gender; (2) perceived gender differs
   from the physician's true gender. Empathic communication was assessed
   using the Rating Scales for the Assessment of Empathic Communication in
   Medical Interviews.
   Results: A 2 (physician's true gender: female vs. male) x 2 (physician's
   perceived gender: female vs. male) x 2 (rater's gender: female vs. male)
   mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) yielded a main effect
   for physician's true gender. Female physicians were rated higher on
   empathic communication than male physicians irrespective of any gender
   labels.
   Conclusion: The present findings suggest that gender differences in the
   perception of physician's empathy are not merely a function of the
   gender label. These findings provide evidence for differences in male
   and female physicians' empathic communication that cannot be attributed
   to stereotype bias.
   Practice implications: Future efforts to evaluate communication skills
   training for general practitioners may consider gender differences. (c)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The terms professionalism and humanism are sometimes confused as being
   synonymous; even more confusing, each is sometimes regarded as a
   component feature of the other. The author argues that, in the context
   of medicine, the two terms describe distinctly different, albeit
   intimately linked attributes of the good doctor. Professionalism denotes
   a way of behaving in accordance with certain normative values, whereas
   humanism denotes an intrinsic set of deep-seated convictions about one's
   obligations toward others. Viewed in this way, humanism is seen as the
   passion that animates professionalism. Nurturing the humanistic
   predispositions of entering medical students is key to ensuring that
   future physicians manifest the attributes of professionalism. Medical
   educators are encouraged to recognize the role of humanism in
   professional development and to incorporate into their curricula and
   learning environments explicit means to reinforce whatever inclinations
   their students have to be caring human beings. Chief among those means
   are respected role models who unfailingly provide humanistic care,
   ceremonies that celebrate the attributes of humanism, awards that honor
   exemplars of the caring physician, and serious engagement with the
   medical humanities to provide vivid insights into what a humanistic
   professional is.}},

Abstract = {{Decisions about admissions to medical school are based on assessments of
   the applicants' cognitive achievements and non-cognitive traits.
   Admission criteria are expected to be fair, transparent, evidence-based
   and legally defensible. However, unlike cognitive criteria, which are
   highly reliable and moderately valid, the reliability and validity of
   the non-cognitive criteria are low or uncertain. Their uncertain
   predictive value is due not only to their limited validity, but also to
   the unknown prevalence of the desirable non-cognitive traits in the
   applicants' pool. Consequently, the use of non-cognitive admission
   criteria inevitably leads to rejection of an unknown proportion of
   applicants who have a desirable trait and selection of applicants who
   lack this trait. We propose that, rather than using non-cognitive
   admission criteria, admission officers should assist prospective
   applicants to make informed decisions based on a reflective
   self-appraisal whether or not to apply to medical school. To this end,
   medical schools should disseminate information on the strains of medical
   training and practice, the frequency of medical errors and the most
   common causes of dissatisfaction and burn-out among practicing
   physicians. Such information may improve the self-selection process and
   thereby enrich the applicants' pool for individuals with appropriate
   motivation. The final selection of medical students may then be based
   either on past academic achievements, or on a lottery, or on various
   combinations thereof.}},

Title = {{The inverse care law: Clinical primary care encounters in deprived and

Journal = {{ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{503-510}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE The inverse care law states that the availability of good
   medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the
   population served, but there is little research on how the inverse care
   law actually operates.
   METHODS A questionnaire study was carried out on 3,044 National Health
   Service (NHS) patients attending 26 general practitioners (GPs); 16 in
   poor areas (most deprived) and 10 in affluent areas (least deprived) in
   the west of Scotland. Data were collected on demographic and
   socioeconomic factors, health variables, and a range of factors relating
   to quality of care.
   RESULTS Compared with patients in least deprived areas, patients in the
   most deprived areas had a greater number of psychological problems, more
   longterm illness, more multimorbidity, and more chronic health problems.
   Access to care generally took longer, and satisfaction with access was
   significantly lower in the most deprived areas. Patients in the most
   deprived areas had more problems to discuss (especially psychosocial),
   yet clinical encounter length was generally shorter. GP stress was
   higher and patient enablement was lower in encounters dealing with
   psychosocial problems in the most deprived areas. Variation in patient
   enablement between GPs was related to both GP empathy and severity of
   deprivation.
   CONCLUSIONS The increased burden of ill health and multimorbidity in
   poor communities results in high demands on clinical encounters in
   primary care. Poorer access, less time, higher GP stress, and lower
   patient enablement are some of the ways that the inverse care law
   continues to operate within the NHS and confounds attempts to narrow
   health inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{Infant colic is a common but poorly defined and understood clinical
   entity and, while several causative factors have been suggested, a
   unifying theory of its pathogenesis is still required. Food
   hypersensitivity/allergy and gut dysmotility are the lead contenders for
   causative factors of infantile colic. Additional confounders and
   covariables include psychological and social factors. Although the
   available data fail to provide insight into the exact triggers of
   infantile colic, these do allow for the hypothesis that certain infants
   are predisposed to dietary protein intolerance and disturbed gut
   motility, such as visceral hypersensitivity/hyperalgesia, in the first
   few weeks of life. These processes lead to distress and altered
   perceptions, where normal stimuli (ie, intestinal distension) are
   misinterpreted as painful events. This review discusses a number of
   interventions, including pharmacological agents, which are based on the
   perceived pathogenesis; however, it is likely that infants with colic
   will require a multifactorial management strategy. Healthcare providers
   must offer support, reassurance and empathy to the caregiver, and adopt
   a biopsychosocial approach to the infants and their families by
   considering any underlying medical diseases in addition to examining the
   family unit. In a small subset of infants with colicky behavior, a
   specific medical disorder such as gastroesophageal reflux or milk
   protein allergy may be identified. While the vast majority of infants
   with colic will recover uneventfully, some may be at risk for the later
   development of behavioral problems and atopy/allergy.}},

Title = {{A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1434-1438}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Empathy is important in the physician-patient relationship.
   Prior studies have suggested that physician empathy may decline with
   clinical training. OBJECTIVE: To measure and examine student empathy
   across medical school years.
   DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of students at Boston
   University School of Medicine in 2006. Incoming students plus each class
   near the end of the academic year were surveyed.
   MEASUREMENTS: The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version
   (JSPE-S), a validated 20-item self-administered questionnaire with a
   total score ranging from 20 to 140. JSPE-S scores were controlled for
   potential confounders such as gender, age, anticipated financial debt
   upon graduation, and future career interest.
   RESULTS: 658 students participated in the study (81.4\% of the school
   population). The first-year medical student class had the highest
   empathy scores (118.5), whereas the fourth-year class had the lowest
   empathy scores (106.6). Measured empathy differed between second- and
   third-year classes (118.2 vs 112.7, P < .001), corresponding to the
   first year of clinical training. Empathy appears to increase from the
   incoming to the first-year class (115.5 vs 118.5, P = .02). Students
   preferring people-oriented specialties had higher empathy scores than
   students preferring technology-oriented specialties (114.6 vs 111.4, P =
   .002). Female students were more likely than male students to choose
   people-oriented specialties (51.5 vs 26.9\%, P < .001). Females had
   higher JSPE-S scores than males (116.5 vs 112.1, P < .001). Age and debt
   did not affect empathy scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Empathy scores of students in the preclinical years were
   higher than in the clinical years. Efforts are needed to determine
   whether differences in empathy scores among the classes are cohort
   effects or represent changes occurring in the course of medical
   education. Future research is needed to confirm whether clinical
   training impacts empathy negatively, and, if so, whether interventions
   can be designed to mitigate this impact.}},

Title = {{Emotion skills training for medical students: a systematic review}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{935-941}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To identify emotion skills training methods and outcomes using
   a systematic review of medical student curricula studies.
   METHODS We searched the English language literature listed in the
   PubMed, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsycINFO and
   Web of Science databases, from 1980 to the present, using a
   comprehensive list of emotion skills keywords and subsequent hand
   searches. A total of 828 articles were initially identified. A manual
   search yielded 161 articles on broadly defined emotion skills
   educational programmes for medical students. A more stringent review and
   hand search of reference lists yielded a final 26 articles that included
   `other-directed' emotion skills (i.e. cognitive and behavioural skills
   intended to manage the emotions of others), a description of the
   training programme, and assessment data.
   RESULTS Emotion skills courses varied by total number of contact hours
   (2-64 hours), session frequency (from 1 session per day to 1 session
   every 6 months), duration (2 weeks to 2 years), pedagogy, patients
   targeted and educational outcomes. Student evaluation data were
   positive. Fifteen of 26 studies used objective emotion skills measures.
   Only 6/26 studies included a control or comparison condition and 5/26
   used a randomised, controlled trial (RCT) design. All 5 RCTs showed
   positive outcomes with modest improvements in emotion communication
   skills, empathy, use of emotion words, supportive behaviours and
   enriched patient understanding.
   CONCLUSIONS The heterogeneity of emotion skills curricular studies makes
   direct comparisons difficult. However, all controlled trials showed
   positive outcomes, suggesting the importance and effectiveness of
   `other-directed' emotion skills training. No specific recommendations
   about curricular amount and frequency, timing and pedagogy can be made.}},

Title = {{Teaching junior doctors to manage patients who somatise: is it possible

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT Many patients in primary care somatise psychological distress.
   Training general practitioners (GPs) to manage somatisation has been
   shown to lead to improvements in their management of these patients.
   However, the training has been intensive and conducted by psychiatrists,
   making it impractical for widespread use. The aim of this research was
   to determine the effectiveness of a teaching package in improving the
   ability of GP registrars to manage patients who somatise, when taught by
   GP vocational course tutors within the constraints of a general practice
   vocational training scheme.
   METHODS This was a before-and-after training evaluation of GP
   registrars' skills. A total of 22 GP registrars and 6 GP course
   organisers were recruited from 3 GP vocational training schemes. The GP
   trainees had 2 videotaped consultations with trained actors role-playing
   patients with somatised depression, before and 1 month after training.
   RESULTS There was a significant overall improvement in the ability of GP
   registrars to manage patients who somatise (mean scores on a 4-point
   Likert scale: pre-training 1.4 {[}standard deviation, SD, 0.6];
   post-training 2.2 {[}SD 0.9]; P = 0.002). General practice registrars
   improved their ability to use a negotiating style of consultation (skill
   present in 8/22 pre-training, 16/22 post-training; P = 0.02) and also
   demonstrated more empathy during the `consultation' after training (mean
   scores on a 5-point Likert scale: pre-training 2.3 {[}SD 1.0];
   post-training 3.0 {[}SD 0.8]; P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS Using a structured training package, it is possible for GP
   vocational course tutors to successfully teach GP registrars to manage
   patients who somatise psychological distress. Given limited resources
   for teaching in terms of cost and time, this training package could have
   important implications for training medical staff.}},

Title = {{Outcome related to impact on daily living: preliminary validation of the
   ORIDL instrument}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: The challenge of finding practical, patient- rated outcome
   measures is a key issue in the evaluation of health care systems and
   interventions. The ORIDL ( Outcome in Relation to Impact on Daily
   Living) instrument ( formerly referred to as the Glasgow Homoeopathic
   Hospital Outcomes Scale or GHHOS) has been developed to measure
   patient's views of the outcome of their care by asking about change, and
   relating this to impact on daily life. The aim of the present paper is
   to describe the background and potential uses of the ORIDL, and to
   report on its preliminary validation in a series of three studies in
   secondary and primary care.
   Methods: In the first study, 105 patients attending the Glasgow
   Homoeopathic Hospital ( GHH) were followed- up at 12 months and changes
   in health status were measured by the EuroQol ( EQOL) and the ORIDL. In
   the second study, 187 new patients at the GHH were followed- up at 3,
   12, and 33 months, using the ORIDL, the Short Form 12 ( SF- 12), and the
   Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile ( MYMOP). In study three, 323
   patients in primary care were followed for 1 month post- consultation
   using the ORIDL and MYMOP. In all 3 studies the Patient Enablement
   Instrument ( PEI) was also used as an outcome measure.
   Results: Study 1 showed substantial improvements in main complaint and
   well- being over 12 months using the ORIDL, with two- thirds of patients
   reporting improvements in daily living. These improvements were not
   significantly correlated with changes in serial measures of the EQOL
   between baseline and 12 months, but were correlated with the EQOL
   transitions measure. Study 2 showed step- wise improvements in ORIDL
   scores between 3 and 33 months, which were only weakly associated with
   similar changes in SF- 12 scores. However, MYMOP change scores
   correlated well with ORIDL scores at all time points. Study 3 showed
   similar high correlations between ORIDL scores and MYMOP scores. In all
   3 studies, ORIDL scores were also significantly correlated with PEI-
   outcome scores.
   Conclusion: There is significant agreement between patient outcomes
   assessed by the ORIDL and the EQOL transition scale, the MYMOP, and the
   PEI- outcome instrument, suggesting that the ORIDL may be a valid and
   sensitive tool for measuring change in relation to impact on life.}},

Abstract = {{At the University of Helsinki, pain-related topics are taught throughout
   medical studies but without a formal pain curriculum. The purpose of
   this study was to assess medical students' attitudes towards pain.
   A questionnaire using a 6-point Likert scale was constructed to measure
   pain-related attitudes and beliefs described in previous studies. After
   a pilot study, the questionnaire was developed to assess attitudes
   towards elderly patients' pain, prescription of opioids. assessment of
   pain and anxiety concerning chronic pain and its treatment. An
   electronic questionnaire with seven demographic and 28 pain-related
   items was sent via e-mail to 680 medical students at the University of
   Helsinki, Finland. Three reminders were sent with a new letter of
   encouragement. The students had 3 weeks to answer the questionnaire.
   The questionnaire was returned by 63.4\% of the students (N = 430).
   There were statistically significant differences between the students in
   different study years showing increasing empathy towards elderly
   patients' pain (p < 0.001), willingness to prescribe opioids (p < 0.001)
   and anxiety about meeting patients suffering from chronic pain (p <
   0.01). Final year students felt significantly more often anxious about
   seeing a chronic pain patient) < 0.05) compared with the first year
   students. Female students were more anxions about seeing a patient
   suffering from chronic pain (p < 0.05) and they were less confident of
   their ability to treat chronic pain patients in primary care) < 0.001)
   than the male students.
   The general attitudes of students mature as hoped for during medical
   studies. Attitudes towards treating the pain of cancer patients and
   elderly patients are positive. Attention should be paid to helping
   students to cope with their emotions and to reducing their anxiety about
   meeting patients with chronic pain. (c) 2006 European Federation of

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical empathy, a critical skill for the doctor-patient
   relationship, is infrequently taught in graduate medical education. No
   study has tested if clinical empathy can be taught effectively.
   Objective: To assess whether medicine residents can learn clinical
   empathy techniques from theater professors.
   Design: A controlled trial of a clinical empathy curriculum taught and
   assessed by 4 theater professors.
   Setting: Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, a large
   urban university and health system.
   Participants: Twenty Internal Medicine residents: 14 in the intervention
   group, 6 in the control group.
   Intervention: Six hours of classroom instruction and workshop time with
   professors of theater.
   Measurements: Scores derived from an instrument with 6 subscores
   designed to measure empathy in real-time patient encounters. Baseline
   comparisons were made using two-sample T tests. A mixed-effects analysis
   of variance model was applied to test for significance between the
   control and intervention groups.
   Results: The intervention group demonstrated significant improvement (p
   <=.011) across all 6 subscores between pre-intervention and
   post-intervention observations. Compared to the control group, the
   intervention group had better posttest scores in 5 of 6 subscores (p
   <=.01).
   Limitations: The study was neither randomized nor blinded.
   Conclusions: Collaborative efforts between the departments of theater
   and medicine are effective in teaching clinical empathy techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Medical educators have promoted skillful communication as a means for
   doctors to develop positive relationships with their patients. In
   practice, communication tends to be defined primarily as what doctors
   say, with less attention to how, when, and to whom they say it. These
   latter elements of communication, which often carry the emotional
   content of the discourse, are usually referred to as interpersonal
   skills. Although recognized as important by some educators,
   interpersonal skills have received much less attention than
   task-oriented, verbal aspects. Moreover, the field lacks a common
   language and conceptualization for discussing them. This paper offers a
   framework for describing interpersonal skills and understanding their
   relationship to verbal communication and describes an interpersonal
   skill-set comprised of Understanding, Empathy, and Relational
   Versatility.}},

Abstract = {{Context.There is considerable interest in the attributes other than
   cognitive ability that medical students need in order to be
   professionally successful, with a particular focus on empathy and
   emotional intelligence (EI). Selection considerations have also
   motivated interest in such attributes as predictors of academic success.
   There are reports of declines in empathy in US medical students, but no
   comparative information is available for UK students.
   Objectives.This study aimed to compare empathy levels in medical
   students in Years 2, 3 (pre-clinical) and 5 (clinical), to examine
   gender differences in empathy and EI, and to investigate whether EI and
   empathy are related to academic success.
   Methods.Questionnaires assessing EI and empathy were completed by
   students. Previous empathy scores for the Year 2 cohort were also
   available. Empathy trends were examined using ANOVA; trends for the Year
   2 group for whom Year 1 scores were available were examined using
   repeated-measures ANOVA. Associations of EI and empathy with academic
   success were examined using Pearson correlation.
   Results.A significant gender x cohort effect was found, with male
   empathy scores increasing between Years 1 and 2, whilst female scores
   declined. Peer ratings in Year 2 problem-based learning (PBL) groups
   were positively correlated with EI.
   Conclusions.Trends in levels of empathy differed by gender. The reasons
   for this require further investigation, particularly in relation to
   course content. Associations between academic performance and EI were
   sparse, and there were none between academic performance and empathy,
   but the effects of EI (and other characteristics) on PBL group
   functioning represent a promising area for future study.}},

Journal = {{NEUROTHERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{545-548}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Medical care of patients with dementia often occurs within a
   physician-patient relationship whose features differ from relationships
   with patients without dementia. Many basic assumptions of the
   physician-patient relationship may not completely hold true, and certain
   aspects of the patient role may be shared by others besides the patient.
   For example, the entire premise of consent to the patient role may be
   inapplicable to patients who lack insight into their illness. In
   addition, caring for cognitively impaired patients who do not comprehend
   the purpose of the physician-patient interaction may render physicians
   vulnerable to losing empathy with their patients and objectifying them.
   This can lead to viewing patients as collections of symptoms rather than
   as humans suffering with illnesses and burdens. The fact that certain
   medical interventions, such as treatment of neuropsychiatric
   disturbances that do not trouble the patient, may appear to be initiated
   for the primary purpose of alleviating caregiver emotional stress also
   affects the physician-patient relationship. The present review examines
   how this relationship may be altered and presents a framework within
   which these alterations can be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To explore residents' competency in medical knowledge and in
   empathy, one element of professionalism, and to evaluate the
   relationship between competencies in these domains.
   Method in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, first-year internal medicine
   residents at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota
   were invited to participate in a prospective, longitudinal study of
   resident competency. Participating residents completed the annual
   Internal Medicine In-Training Examination (ITE) each October and the
   Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a standardized tool to measure
   empathy administered at multiple time points during training. Changes in
   medical knowledge and empathy between the fall of postgraduate years one
   and two were evaluated, and associations between medical knowledge and
   empathy were explored.
   Results Residents' medical knowledge as measured by the ITE increased
   over the first year of training (mean increase 8.7 points, P < .0001),
   whereas empathy as measured by the empathic concern subscale of the IRI
   decreased over this same time period (mean decrease 1.6 points, P =
   .0003). No significant correlation was found between medical knowledge
   and empathy or between changes in these domains of competency over time.
   Conclusions Resident competency in the domains of medical knowledge and
   empathy seems to be influenced by separate and independent aspects of
   training. Training environments may promote competency in one domain
   while simultaneously eroding competency in another. Residency programs
   should devise specific curricula to promote each domain of physician
   competency.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Significant information exchange occurs between a doctor and
   patient through nonverbal communication such as gestures, body position,
   and eye gaze. In addition, empathy is an important trust-building
   element in a physician: patient relationship. Previous work validates
   the use of virtual patients (VP) to teach and assess content items
   related to history-taking and basic communication skills. The purpose of
   this study was to determine whether more complex communication skills,
   such as nonverbal behaviors and empathy, were similar when students
   interacted with a VP or standardized patient (SP).
   Methods: Medical students (n = 84) at the University of Florida (UF) and
   the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) underwent a videotaped interview
   with either a SP or a highly interactive VP with abdominal pain. In the
   scenario, a life-sized VP was projected on the wall of an exam room in
   SP teaching and testing centers at both institutions. VP and SP scripted
   responses to student questions were identical. To prompt an empathetic
   response (ie, acknowledging the patients' feelings), during the
   interview the VP or SP stated ``I am scared; can you help me?{''}
   Clinicians (n = 4) rated student videotapes with respect to nonverbal
   communication skills and empathetic behaviors using a Likert-type scale
   with anchored descriptors.
   Results: Clinicians rated students interacting with SPs higher with
   respect to the nonverbal communication skills such as head nod (2.78 +/-
   .79 vs 1.94 +/- .44, P <.05), and body lean (2.97 +/- .94 vs 1.93 +/-
   .58, P <.05), level of immersion in the scenario (3.31 +/- .49 vs 2.26
   +/- .52, P <.05), anxiety (1.16 +/- .31 vs 1.45 +/- .33, P < .05),
   attitude toward the patient (3.24 +/- .43 vs 2.89 +/- .36, P < .05), and
   asking clearer questions (3.06 +/- .32 vs 2.51 +/- .32, P < .05)
   compared to the VP group. The students in the SP group also had a higher
   empathy rating (2.75 +/- .86 vs 2.16 +/- .83, P < .05) and better
   overall rating (4.29 +/- 1.32 vs 3.24 +/- 1.06, P < .05) than the VP
   group. Empathy was positively correlated with the observed nonverbal
   communication behaviors. Eye contact was the most strongly correlated
   with empathy (r =.57, P < .001), followed by head nod (r =.55, P < .001)
   and body lean (r =.49, P < .001).
   Conclusions: Medical students demonstrate nonverbal communication
   behaviors and respond empathetically to a VP, although the quantity and
   quality of these behaviors were less than those exhibited in a similar
   SP scenario. Student empathy in response to the VP was less genuine and
   not as sincere as compared to the SP scenario. While we will never
   duplicate a real physician/patient interaction, virtual clinical
   scenarios could augment existing SP programs by providing a
   controllable, secure, and safe learning environment with the opportunity
   for repetitive practice. (C) 2007 Published by Excerpta Medica Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic pain is very common in all European countries, with
   musculoskeletal problems predominating. About 1\% of the adult
   population develops a syndrome of chronic muscle pain, fibromyalgia
   (FMS), characterized by multiple tender points, back or neck pain, and a
   number of associated problems from other organs, including a high
   frequency of fatigue. Evidence points to central sensitization as an
   important neurophysiological aberration in the development of FMS.
   Importantly, these neurological changes may result from inadequately
   treated chronic focal pain problems such as osteoarthritis or myofascial
   pain. It is important for health professionals to be aware of this
   syndrome and to diagnose the patients to avoid a steady increase in
   diagnostic tests. On the other hand, patients with chronic widespread
   pain have an increased risk of developing malignancies, and new or
   changed symptoms should be diagnosed even in FMS. In rheumatology
   practice it is especially important to be aware of the existence of FMS
   in association with immune inflammatory diseases, most commonly lupus
   and rheumatoid arthritis. Differential diagnoses are other causes of
   chronic pain, e.g. thyroid disease. The costs of this syndrome are
   substantial due to loss of working capability and direct expenses of
   medication and health-system usage. Fibromyalgia patients need
   recognition of their pain syndrome if they are to comply with treatment.
   Lack of empathy and understanding by healthcare professionals often
   leads to patient frustration and inappropriate illness behavior, often
   associated with some exaggeration of symptoms in an effort to gain some
   legitimacy for their problem. FMS is multifaceted, and treatment
   consists of both medical interventions, with emphasis on agents acting
   on the central nervous system, and physical exercises.}},

Abstract = {{Even though the importance of empathy for a good
   physician-patient-relationship is consistently emphasized, there are
   only a few empirical investigations. In this study the empathy of
   surgeons was evaluated by asking them to put themselves in the
   preoperative situation of a patient with a rectal carcinoma. They should
   state the quality of life from the patient's point of view using the
   EORTC-QLQ-C30. As a second step the assumed postoperative quality of
   life of the patients at the point of their discharge from hospital was
   evaluated. The data collected from the surgeons were compared with the
   results of a prospective longitudinal analysis of the quality of life of
   rectal carcinoma patients. As well the preoperative situation of the
   patients as their situation before discharge from hospital were
   evaluated more negatively by the surgeons than by the patients
   themselves. The doctors assumed much more problems and especially a
   deeper negative impact on the social and emotional acting of the
   patients. The surgeons and additionally questioned non-medical staff
   members did not differ in their results, just as the period of
   employment had no significant influence on the outcome. Accordingly to
   the results it can be deduced that the patients felt better than the
   doctors assumed, so that we can advise the surgeons to intensify the
   empathy in their patients' perception. Therefore, new course curricula
   should be developed to train the non-technical-skills of health
   professionals.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{The paper sets forth a set of evidence-based recommendations for
   interventions to combat unintentional bias among health care providers,
   drawing upon theory and research in social cognitive psychology. Our
   primary aim is to provide a framework that outlines strategies and
   skills, which can be taught to medical trainees and practicing
   physicians, to prevent unconscious racial attitudes and stereotypes from
   negatively influencing the course and outcomes of clinical encounters.
   These strategies and skills are designed to: 1) enhance internal
   motivation to reduce bias, while avoiding external pressure; 2) increase
   understanding about the psychological basis of bias; 3) enhance
   providers' confidence in their ability to successfully interact with
   socially dissimilar patients; 4) enhance emotional regulation skills;
   and 5) improve the ability to build partnerships with patients. We
   emphasize the need for programs to provide a nonthreatening environment
   in which to practice new skills and the need to avoid making providers
   ashamed of having racial, ethnic, or cultural stereotypes. These
   recommendations are also intended to provide a springboard for research
   on interventions to reduce unintentional racial bias in health care.}},

Abstract = {{The androgen theory of autism proposes that autism spectrum conditions
   (ASC) are in part due to elevated fetal testosterone (FT) levels, which
   are positively correlated with a number of autistic traits and inversely
   correlated with social development and empathy. A medical questionnaire
   was completed by n = 54 women with ASC, n = 74 mothers of children with
   ASC, and n = 183 mothers of typically developing children to test
   whether women with ASC have an increased rate of testosterone-related
   medical conditions, and to see whether mothers of children with ASC show
   similar abnormalities, as part of the `broader autism phenotype'.
   Compared to controls, significantly more women with ASC reported (a)
   hirsutism, (b) bisexuality or asexuality, (c) irregular menstrual cycle,
   (d) dysmenorrhea, (c) polycystic ovary syndrome, (f) severe acne, (g)
   epilepsy, (h) tomboyism, and (i) family history of ovarian, uterine, and
   prostate cancers, tumors, or growths. Compared to controls,
   significantly more mothers of ASC children reported (a) severe acne, (b)
   breast and uterine cancers, tumors, or growths, and (c) family history
   of ovarian and uterine cancers, tumors, or growths. These results
   suggest current hormone abnormalities in women with ASC and their
   mothers. Direct investigations of serum testosterone levels and genetic
   susceptibility to high testosterone production or sensitivity in women
   with ASC would illuminate the origin of these conditions. The
   relationship between FT and current testosterone levels also needs to be
   clarified. The present results may be relevant to understanding the
   increased male risk to developing autism. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Physicians associate empathy with benevolent emotions and with
   developing a shared understanding with patients. While there have been
   many articles on managing ``difficult{''} patients, little attention has
   been paid to the challenges physicians face during conflicts with
   patients, especially when both parties are angry and yet empathy is
   still needed. This topic is especially important in light of recent
   studies showing that practicing medicine increasingly requires
   physicians to manage their own feelings of anger and frustration. This
   article seeks to describe how physicians can learn to empathize with
   patients even when they are both subject to emotions that lead to
   interpersonal distancing. Empathy is defined as engaged curiosity about
   another's particular emotional perspective. Five specific ways for
   physicians to foster empathy during conflict are described: recognizing
   one's own emotions, attending to negative emotions over time, attuning
   to patients' verbal and nonverbal emotional messages, and becoming
   receptive to negative feedback. Importantly, physicians who learn to
   empathize with patients during emotionally charged interactions can
   reduce anger and frustration and also increase their therapeutic impact.}},

Abstract = {{Medical students enter medical school hoping to have good relationships
   with their patients. Along with residents, however, they are exposed to
   a hidden curriculum that places the acquisition of biomedical knowledge
   above and at times at odds with development of the awareness and
   relationship skills important to the patient-physician relationship.
   Seasoned clinicians often enjoy the capacity for rich, healing
   relationships that are marked by reciprocal influence between them and
   their patients. The author argues that it is not necessary to relegate
   this recapturing of the human side of medicine to a midcareer epiphany,
   and the author calls for educational measures to encourage development
   of the communication and relationship-building skills throughout the
   medical education process. This will require a paradigm shift to a
   culture where teachers and learners are willing to consciously attend to
   their relationships and to work on self-awareness and mindfulness while
   they also master the biomedical knowledge required of the profession.
   Medical educators can facilitate and support continuous development of
   these skills throughout medical school and residency. Within the
   curriculum, there are many opportunities to teach how to reflect and to
   guide those reflections in ways that enhance our students' and
   residents' understanding of themselves as individuals and in the
   relationships they form with their patients. Using examples from
   narratives gathered in workshops and on work rounds with students and
   residents at the University of Washington School of Medicine, the author
   explores the concepts of relationship-centered care, self-awareness, and
   mindfulness as proposed cornerstones of a new foundation for medical
   education.}},
