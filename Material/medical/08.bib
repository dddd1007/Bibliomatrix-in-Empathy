Abstract = {{How to select candidates with appropriate personal qualities for medical
   school is an important issue. This study examined the psychometric
   properties and group differences of the Personal Qualities Assessment
   (PQA) to test the feasibility of using it as a tool to assess the
   medical school applicants in a non-Western culture. Seven hundred
   forty-six medical students in Taiwan completed two psychometric
   measures: Mojac to assess moral orientation and NACE to assess four
   aspects of interpersonal relationships. Thirty-one students completed
   the tests twice to establish test-retest reliability. A subsample of 127
   students also completed a measure of the ``Big Five{''} personality
   traits to examine the construct validity of these scales. Both Mojac and
   NACE had acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
   Conceptually, coherent and significant relationships were observed
   between test components and between the NACE and Big Five. NACE but not
   Mojac varied significantly between different sociodemographic groups.
   Both tests demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. However, the
   predictive validity of PQA requires future studies.}},

Title = {{Details acquired from medical history and patients' experience of
   empathy - two sides of the same coin}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: History taking and empathetic communication are two
   important aspects in successful physician-patient interaction. Gathering
   important information from the patient's medical history is needed for
   effective clinical decision making while empathy is relevant for patient
   satisfaction. We wanted to investigate whether medical students near
   graduation are able to combine both skills as required in daily medical
   practice.
   Methods: Thirty near graduates from Hamburg Medical School participated
   in an assessment for clinical competences including a consultation hour
   with five standardized patients. Each patient interview was videotaped
   and standardized patients rated participants with the CARE questionnaire
   for consultation and relational empathy. All videotaped interviews were
   rated with a checklist based on the number of important medical aspects
   for each case. Data were analysed with the linear mixed model to correct
   for random effects. Regression analysis was performed to look for
   correlations between the number of questions asked by a participant and
   their respective empathy rating.
   Results: Of the 123 aspects that could have been gathered in total,
   students only requested 56.4\% (95\% CI 53.5-59.3). While no difference
   between male and female participants was found, a significant difference
   (p < .001) was observed between the two parts of the checklist with
   61.1\% (95\% CI 57.9-64.3) of aspects asked for in part 1 (patient's
   symptoms) versus 52.0 (95 47.4-56.7) in part 2 (further history). All
   female standardized patients combined rated female participants (mean
   score 14.2, 95\% CI 12.3-16.3) to be significantly (p < .01) more
   empathetic than male participants (mean score 19.2, 95\% CI 16.3-22.6).
   Regression analysis revealed no correlation between the number of
   medical aspects gathered by a participant and his or her respective
   empathy score given by the standardized patient in the CARE
   questionnaire.
   Conclusion: Gathering sufficient medical data from a patient's history
   and empathetic communication are two completely separate sides of the
   coin of history taking. While both skills have to be acquired during
   medical school training with particular focus on their respective
   learning objectives, medical students need to be provided with
   additional learning and feedback opportunities where they can be
   observed exercising both skills combined as required in physicians'
   daily practice.}},

Abstract = {{Whilst an individual's cognitive skills are essential for academic
   progress, the possession of non-cognitive skills, such as empathy and
   ethical judgement are attributes required and valued in those applying
   to join healthcare programmes and by the profession itself. Doubts have
   been expressed, however, whether final selection using traditional
   interviewing methods serve adequately to reveal these key competencies.
   Kingston University and St George's University of London, therefore,
   have employed the Multiple-Mini-Interview (MMI) system for those
   applying to their BSc Nursing Programme. The MMI comprises a series of
   interview `stations' where candidates respond to scenarios and are
   assessed on their display of required skills/competences.
   890 candidates and 82 interviewers completed a short questionnaire to
   gauge their reaction to the concept. There were positive responses from
   candidates with 65\% replying that it was ``a better experience{''}
   compared with traditional interviews. Unsolicited comment was generally
   found to refer to restrictions on opportunities to express enthusiasm
   for nursing. Interviewers likewise responded positively with 71\% noting
   ``a better experience.{''} Unsolicited feedback indicated that some
   would have preferred to have had greater opportunity to discuss nursing
   issues, with their interviewees.
   It has been agreed that the MMI system of interviewing will be retained
   and further work will include the tracking of students through and into
   the workplace. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aims of the study are: (1) To develop and test a
   theory-based model for the predictive power of ``Shared decision making
   (SDM){''}, ``Empathy{''} and ``Team interaction{''} for ``Patient
   satisfaction{''} and ``Treatment acceptance{''}. (2) To identify
   mediating effects of ``Compliance{''} and ``Satisfaction with
   decision{''}.
   Methods: Within a multi-center cross-sectional study (11 inpatient
   rehabilitation clinics at different indication fields), the model was
   evaluated in descriptive and structure analytical terms based on survey
   data of N = 402 inpatients.
   Results: The structural equation model proved to exhibit an appropriate
   data fit. A high proportion of variance of ``Patient satisfaction{''}
   (61\%) and ``Treatment acceptance{''} (67\%) can be predicted by
   ``SDM{''}, ``Empathy{''}, ``Satisfaction with decision{''} and ``Team
   interaction{''}. While no mediating effects were found for the two
   subcomponents of ``Compliance{''} ({''}Patient cooperation{''},
   ``Adherence{''}), ``Satisfaction with decision{''} showed a full
   mediation for ``Treatment acceptance{''} and a partial mediation for
   ``Patient satisfaction{''}.
   Conclusion: ``Team interaction{''} should be considered as an important
   predictor of process and patient-centered outcome characteristics.
   Practice implications: The current findings can be used to derive
   measures as well as interventions to optimize the organization of
   participatory care within teams in order to strengthen patient
   centeredness and to ensure a high quality of care. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: Traditional perspectives on shared decision-making (SDM)
   focus attention on the point in a clinical encounter where discussion of
   a treatment decision begins. We argue that SDM is shaped not only by
   initiation of a treatment decision, but also by the entire clinical
   encounter, and; even more broadly, by the nature of the patient-provider
   relationship.
   Method: The Four Habits Approach to Effective Clinical Communication, a
   validated and widely used framework for patient-provider communication,
   was used to understand how SDM is integrally tied to the entire clinical
   encounter, as well as to the broader patient-provider relationship.
   Results: The Four Habits consists of four categories of behaviors: (1)
   invest in the beginning; (2) elicit the patient's perspective; (3)
   demonstrate empathy; and (4) invest in the end. We argue that the
   behaviors included in all four of these categories work together to
   create and maintain an environment conducive to SDM.
   Conclusion: SDM cannot be understood in isolation, and future SDM
   research should reflect the influence that the broader communicative and
   relational contexts have on decisions.
   Practice implications: SDM training might be more effective if training
   focused on the broader context of communication and relationships, such
   as those specified by the Four Habits framework. (c) 2013 Published by

Title = {{``More shades of grey in my answers': an interview study revisiting
   attitude erosion during clerkships}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Context Small declines in patient-centred attitudes during medical
   education have caused great concern. Although some of the self-report
   scales applied have solid psychometric foundations, validity evidence
   for the interpretation of attitude erosion during clerkships remains
   weak. Objectives We sought to address this gap in a qualitative study of
   the relationships between scores on four commonly used attitude scales
   and participants' experiences and reflections. Our aim was to gain a
   better understanding of the score changes from the participants'
   perspectives. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15
   junior doctors from a cohort (n=37) that had previously shown a small
   decline in patient-centred attitudes during clerkships, measured on four
   self-report scales. In the interviews, we explored interviewees'
   experiences of their development of patient-centredness and subsequently
   discussed their scale scores, particularly for those items that
   contributed to a rise or decline in scores. We analysed the data using a
   process of constant comparison among personal experiences, scale scores
   and participants' explanations of score changes, applying the coding
   techniques of grounded theory. Results The analysis revealed important
   response distortions that might be responsible for small declines in
   scores during clerkships separately from changes in attitudes. The
   drastic alterations to the participants' frame of reference,
   attributable to the transition to clinical practice, represented the
   most prominent cause of distortion. More nuanced, context-specific,
   patient-centred reasoning resulted in more neutral responses after
   clerkships, paradoxically causing a decline in scores. In addition to
   response distortions, the interviews revealed shortcomings in content
   validity such as an extreme' construct of patient-centredness.
   Conclusions This study calls into question the validity of the
   interpretation of attitude erosion during clerkships. The findings
   suggest that small declines in scores on self-report attitude scales are
   related to a recalibration of trainees' understandings of
   patient-centredness as they grow more clinically experienced. The
   evolved construct of patient-centredness and the way attitudes are
   measured require special attention in the development of future
   instruments.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand clinical empathy and what factors can undermine its
   experience and outcome in care-giving settings, a large-scale study was
   conducted with 7,584 board certified practicing physicians. Online
   validated instruments assessing different aspects of empathy, distress,
   burnout, altruistic behavior, emotional awareness, and well-being were
   used. Compassion satisfaction was strongly associated with empathic
   concern, perspective taking and altruism, while compassion fatigue
   (burnout and secondary traumatic stress) was more closely related to
   personal distress and alexithymia. Gender had a highly selective effect
   on empathic concern, with women displaying higher values, which led to a
   wide array of negative and devalued feelings. Years of experience did
   not influence dispositional measures per se after controlling for the
   effect of age and gender. Participants who experienced compassion
   fatigue with little to no compassion satisfaction showed the highest
   scores on personal distress and alexithymia as well as the strongest
   indicators of compassion fatigue. Physicians who have difficulty
   regulating their negative arousal and describing and identifying
   emotions seem to be more prone to emotional exhaustion, detachment, and
   a low sense of accomplishment. On the contrary, the ability to engage in
   self-other awareness and regulate one's emotions and the tendency to
   help others, seem to contribute to the sense of compassion that comes
   from assisting patients in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Education Not Discrimination (END) is the component of the Time to
   Change programme intended to reduce mental health stigma among
   professionals and professional trainees.
   Aims
   To investigate the impact of the END anti-stigma programme on medical
   students immediately and after 6 months with regard to knowledge,
   attitudes, behaviour and empathy.
   Method
   A total of 1452 medical students participated in the study (intervention
   group n=1066, control group n=386). Participants completed
   questionnaires at baseline, and at immediate and 6-month follow-up.
   Groups were compared for changes in stigma outcomes.
   Results
   All measures improved in both groups, particularly among students with
   less knowledge and more stigmatising attitudes and intended behaviour at
   baseline. At immediate follow-up the intervention group demonstrated
   significantly greater improvements in stigma-related knowledge and
   reductions in stigma-related attitudes and intended behaviour, relative
   to the control group. At 6 months' follow-up, however, only one attitude
   item remained significantly better.
   Conclusions
   Although the intervention produced short-term advantage there was little
   evidence for its persistent effect, suggesting a need for greater
   integration of ongoing measures to reduce stigma into the medical
   curriculum.}},
