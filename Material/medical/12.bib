Abstract = {{The democratization of civil society and the development of modern
   medicine changed the sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship to a
   doctor-partner dialogue. Values and respect were lost in the process
   where common courtesy and empathy in trust were replaced by patient
   rights. Launch of Europa Uomo. Europa Uomo, the European prostate cancer
   coalition, represents 22 national, autonomous patient support groups.
   Its aim includes increasing the awareness of prostate diseases, support
   individualized treatment as a balance between optimal medical treatment
   and personalized care delivered by a multiprofessional team. We expect
   our information/education from dedicated professional societies while in
   return we share care for properly informed members as well as a fast,
   unbiased and cheap distribution of information/innovation across the
   European continent. The role of a patient group. Our advocacy role is
   focused on quality of life, tailored treatment, knowledge of risk
   factors, support for research and last but not least active
   partnerships. We believe that we can play a modest but basic role in
   common actions to overcome inequalities in treatment and care in Europe.
   Our responsibilities range from defining patient obligations to
   facilitating translational research and saving scarce health resources.
   The horizon of the patient. Our hope is to plead for a treatment policy
   on the man first and then on his cancer and to improve treatment
   outcomes by multiprofessional collaboration and the development of
   expert Prostate Units. Future expectations. A transparent, open
   communication line between the multiprofessional team and the patient is
   mandatory. The existing uncertainties should be discussed with common
   sense but always leave a factor of hope in survival or quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   This study investigated the relationship between empathy and grades,
   marital status and personality in psychiatric residents.
   Methods
   We sent a questionnaire package to 592 psychiatric residents in 82
   psychiatric residency training hospitals. The questionnaire package
   collected socio-demographic data, and included the Jefferson Scale of
   Empathy, HP-version, Korean edition (JSE-HP-K), and Temperament and
   Character Inventory (TCI).
   Results
   Fourth-year residents had significantly higher scores on the JSE-HP-K
   than 1st-year residents. Marital status and empathy had significant
   correlation. Married residents showed significantly higher scores on the
   JSE-HP-K. There were no significant differences in empathy with regard
   to age, sex, motivation towards medical science (entering medical school
   and psychiatry) and club activity. There was no significant correlation
   between subscales of the TCI and JSE-HP-K score.
   Discussion
   These results suggest that empathy is associated with marital status and
   that psychiatry residency program contributes incrementally to empathy
   for residents.}},

Title = {{A Brief Instrument to Measure Patients' Overall Satisfaction With
   Primary Care Physicians}},
Journal = {{FAMILY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{412-417}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A brief and psychometrically sound scale to
   measure patients' overall satisfaction with their primary care
   physicians would be useful in studies where a longer instrument is
   impractical. The purpose of this study was to develop and examine the
   psychometrics of a brief instrument to measure patients' overall
   satisfaction with their primary care physicians.
   METHODS: Research participants included 535 outpatients (between 18-75
   years old, 66\% female) who completed a mailed survey that included 10
   items for measuring overall satisfaction with their primary care
   physician who was named on the survey. Patients were also asked about
   their perceptions of physician empathy, preventive tests recommended by
   the physician (colonoscopy, mammogram, and prostate-specific antigen
   (PSA) for age and gender appropriate patients) and demographic
   information.
   RESULTS: Factor analysis of the patient satisfaction items resulted in
   one prominent component. Corrected item-total score correlations of the
   patient satisfaction scale ranged from 0.85 to 0.96; correlation between
   patient satisfaction scores and patient perception of physician empathy
   was 0.93, and correlation with recommending the physician to family and
   friends was 0.92. Criterion-related validity coefficients were mostly in
   the 0.80s and 0.90s. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly
   higher for those whose physicians recommended preventive tests
   (colonoscopy, mammogram, and PSA-compliance rates >.80). Cronbach's
   coefficient alpha for patient satisfaction scale was 0.98.
   CONCLUSIONS: Empirical evidence supported the validity and reliability
   of a brief patient satisfaction scale that has utility in the
   assessments of educational programs aimed at improving patient
   satisfaction, medical services, and patient outcomes in primary care
   settings.}},

Title = {{Levels of empathy in undergraduate midwifery students: An Australian
   cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{WOMEN AND BIRTH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{80-84}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This exploratory study investigated empathy and attitudes
   towards specific medical conditions, two important aspects of the
   midwife-woman relationship, amongst undergraduate midwifery students at
   one university.
   Method: Fifty-two Bachelor of Midwifery students across three years of
   the course completed questionnaires, the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy-Health Professional (JSPE-HP) version and the Medical Condition
   Regard Scale (MCRS). Both the JSPE-HP and the MCRS are standardised,
   self-report questionnaires with established reliability and validity.
   Findings: An overall respectable level of empathy was measured, which
   was shown to increase consistently and substantially with each year
   level of the student undergraduate program. Attitudes to selected
   diagnoses were very good with the exception being substance abuse, which
   received a significantly lower mean.
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the Bachelor of
   Midwifery course, or studying midwifery, has a positive effect on
   students' empathy. Low results in participants' attitudes towards
   patients presenting with substance abuse raises concern that students
   may harbour prejudice that could impinge upon their professional
   practice and the way in which they care for these mothers. Hence, this
   aspect in particular may need further development within midwifery
   curriculum development. Further research around other conditions may
   extend on our understandings of empathy and attitudes in midwifery
   students and practitioners. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe how psychology and
   medical students assess their own competency and skills before and after
   training, in which role-play was used to teach interpersonal and
   communication skills.
   Method: Interpersonal and communication skills were assessed with a
   semi-structured questionnaire before and after the training.
   Results: The students of both medicine and psychology estimated their
   skill levels to be higher after the course. The psychology students
   estimated their skills for communication, motivating interviewing,
   empathy and reflection, and change orientation to be better at the end
   of the course. Medical students estimated their communication skills,
   motivating interviewing skills, and change orientation skills to be
   better at the end of the course.
   Conclusion: Even a short period of training in interpersonal and
   communication skills can positively affect the self-assessed skills of
   the medical students.
   Practice implications: In the future, it would be worthwhile to pay
   attention to reflective teaching practices in the training of both
   medical and psychology students. The cognitive and emotional components
   of these practices help students to develop their own communication

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective Many healthcare organizations (HCOs) including Kaiser
   Permanente, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Medical Center, and MD Anderson
   Cancer Center, provide access to online health communities as part of
   their overall patient support services. The key objective in
   establishing and running these online health communities is to offer
   empathic support to patients. Patients' perceived empathy is considered
   to be critical in patient recovery, specifically, by enhancing patient's
   compliance with treatment protocols and the pace of healing. Most online
   health communities are characterized by two main functions:
   informational support and social support. This study examines the
   relative impact of these two distinct functions that is, as an
   information seeking forum and as a social support forum on patients'
   perceived empathy in online health communities.
   Design This study tests the impact of two variables that reflect the
   above functions of online health communities information seeking
   effectiveness and perceived social support on perceived empathy. The
   model also incorporates the potential moderating effect of homophily on
   these relationships.
   Measurements A web-based survey was used to collect data from members of
   the online health communities provided by three major healthcare
   centers. A regression technique was used to analyze the data to test the
   hypotheses.
   Results The study finds that it is the information seeking effectiveness
   rather than the social support which affects patient's perceived empathy
   in online health communities run by HCOs. The results indicate that HCOs
   that provide online health communities for their patients need to focus
   more on developing tools that will make information seeking more
   effective and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Contemporary educational approaches to professionalism do
   not take into account the dominant influence that the culture of
   academic medicine has on the nascent professional attitudes, beliefs,
   and behaviors of medical learners. This article examines formation as an
   organizing principle for professionalism in medical education. Virtue,
   the foundation to understanding professionalism, is the habits and
   dispositions that are fostered in individuals but that are embedded in
   learning environments. Formation, the ongoing integration of an
   individual, growing in self-awareness and in recognition of a life of
   service, with others who share in the common mission of a larger group,
   depicts this process. One model of formation considers a continuum from
   novice to more advance stages that is predicated on rules that must be
   applied in greater contextually shaped situations. Within medical
   education, formation is the process by which lives of service are
   created and sustained by learning communities that promote human
   capacities for intuition, empathy, and compassion. An imagined
   curriculum in formation would link the lived experiences of mentors and
   learners with an interdisciplinary set of didactic materials in an
   intentionally progressive fashion.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Most studies showed that patients would first go to their
   primary care physicians (PCPs) when depressed. This choice is probably
   due to PCP being the entry point into the health care system. We studied
   the general population's initial choice of mental care in Hong Kong,
   where patients were unclear about family medicine and free to choose
   doctors of any specialty.
   METHODS: A combined qualitative and quantitative approach was adopted.
   We held focus groups with participants recruited from community centers
   and a telephone survey with adults ages 18 or above randomly selected
   from the domestic telephone directory.
   RESULTS: Of 1,647 adults successfully interviewed, 49.0\% would seek
   help from their regular PCP, 19.3\% from psychiatrists, 4.8\% from any
   doctors, 16.5\% from non-medical resources; 6.9\% would not seek any
   help, and 3.5\% were uncertain of what to do. Those who did not seek any
   help were more likely to be male or without regular doctors. The focus
   group participants highlighted the stigmatizing effect of consulting
   psychiatrists and expressed strong expectation of empathic relationship,
   time, and communication skills from their care providers. Some
   participants were not aware that PCP could manage mental illness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given free choice of health care service, most people would
   first consult their regular doctors for treatment of depression
   specifically because of better relationship and no stigmatization. To
   draw depressed patients to seek help, especially from primary care,
   public education of the PCPs role in mental health should be promoted,
   and the PCPs could demonstrate their empathy and listening skills to
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological evidence indicates that African Americans receive lower
   quality pain treatment than European Americans. However, the factors
   causing these disparities remain unidentified, and solutions to this
   problem remain elusive. Across three laboratory experiments, we examined
   the hypotheses that empathy is not only causing pain treatment
   disparities but that empathy-inducing interventions can reduce these
   disparities. Undergraduates (Experiments 1 and 2) and nursing
   professionals (Experiment 3) watched videos of real Black and White
   patients' genuine facial expressions of pain, provided pain treatment
   decisions, and reported their feelings of empathy for each patient. The
   efficacy of an empathy-inducing, perspective-taking intervention at
   reducing pain treatment disparities was also examined (Experiments 2 and
   3). When instructed to attempt to provide patients with the best care,
   participants exhibited significant pro-White pain treatment biases.
   However, participants engaged in an empathy-inducing, perspective-taking
   intervention that instructed them to imagine how patients' pain affected
   patients' lives exhibited upwards of a 55\% reduction in pain treatment
   bias in comparison to controls. Furthermore, Pro-White empathy biases
   were highly predictive of pro-White pain treatment biases. The magnitude
   of the empathy bias experienced predicted the magnitude of the treatment
   bias exhibited. These findings suggest that empathy plays a crucial role
   in racial pain treatment disparities in that it appears not only to be
   one likely cause of pain treatment disparities but also is an important
   means for reducing racial disparities in pain treatment. (C) 2010

Title = {{Physicians' messages in problematic sickness certification: a narrative
   analysis of case reports}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many physicians find sickness certification tasks
   problematic. There is some knowledge about situations that are
   experienced as problematic, whereas less is understood about how
   physicians respond to the problems they face. One way to acquire such
   knowledge is to consider ``reflection-in-action{''}, aspects of which
   are expressed in the physician's interpretation of the patient's story.
   The aim of this study was to gain knowledge about the meaning content of
   case reports about problematic sickness certification. Specifically, we
   looked for possible messages to the colleagues intended to read the
   reports.
   Methods: A narrative approach was used to analyse reports about
   problematic sickness certification cases that had been written by GPs
   and occupational health service physicians as part of a sickness
   insurance course. The analysis included elements from both thematic and
   structural analysis. Nineteen case reports were used in the actual
   analysis and 25 in the validation of the results. Main narrative
   qualities and structural features of the written case reports were
   explored.
   Results: Five types of messages were identified in the case reports,
   here classified as ``a call for help{''}, ``a call for
   understanding{''}, ``hidden worries{''}, ``in my opinion{''}, and
   ``appearing neutral{''}. In the reports, the physicians tried to achieve
   neutrality in their writing, and the patients' stories tended to be
   interpreted within a traditional biomedical framework. In some cases
   there was an open request for help, in others it was not obvious that
   the physician had any problems. Overall, the messages were about having
   problems as such, rather than the specific features of the problems.
   Conclusions: The case reports clearly demonstrated different ways of
   writing about problems that arise during sickness certification, from
   being neutral and not mentioning the problems to being emotionally
   involved and asking for help. The general character of the messages
   suggests that they are also relevant for case reports in problematic
   areas other than sickness certification. If pertinent relationships can
   be found between reflection-in-practice and the narrative writing about
   practice, they will provide an approach to further research concerning
   consultations perceived as problematic and also to medical education.}},

Title = {{How trainees would disclose medical errors: educational implications for
   training programmes}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{372-380}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   The disclosure of harmful errors to patients is recommended, but appears
   to be uncommon. Understanding how trainees disclose errors and how their
   practices evolve during training could help educators design programmes
   to address this gap. This study was conducted to determine how trainees
   would disclose medical errors.
   Methods
   We surveyed 758 trainees (488 students and 270 residents) in internal
   medicine at two academic medical centres. Surveys depicted one of two
   harmful error scenarios that varied by how apparent the error would be
   to the patient. We measured attitudes and disclosure content using
   scripted responses.
   Results
   Trainees reported their intent to disclose the error as `definitely'
   (43\%), `probably' (47\%), `only if asked by patient' (9\%), and
   `definitely not' (1\%). Trainees were more likely to disclose obvious
   errors than errors that patients were unlikely to recognise (55\% versus
   30\%; p < 0.01). Respondents varied widely in the type of information
   they would disclose. Overall, 50\% of trainees chose to use statements
   that explicitly stated that an error rather than only an adverse event
   had occurred. Regarding apologies, trainees were split between conveying
   a general expression of regret (52\%) and making an explicit apology
   (46\%). Respondents at higher levels of training were less likely to use
   explicit apologies (trend p < 0.01). Prior disclosure training was
   associated with increased willingness to disclose errors (odds ratio
   1.40, p = 0.03).
   Conclusions
   Trainees may not be prepared to disclose medical errors to patients and
   worrisome trends in trainee apology practices were observed across
   levels of training. Medical educators should intensify efforts to
   enhance trainees' skills in meeting patients' expectations for the open
   disclosure of harmful medical errors.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To categorize physician communication demonstrating
   understanding of what patients want to know and skill in conveying that
   information. Physicians underestimate how much information patients want
   and patients rarely seek information during clinic visits. Transparent
   communication is advocated to facilitate patient understanding and
   support autonomy, informed decision-making and relationship development.
   Methods: Analysis and coding of 263 audiotaped interactions between 33
   primary care physicians and their patients in eight community-based,
   primary care clinics in Washington State, USA.
   Results: Physicians proactively used five types of process transparency
   to preview speech and actions. Four types of content transparency were
   used to explicate diagnosis and treatment, demystify medical language
   and concepts, and interpret biomedical information. Physicians spent the
   greatest proportion of clinic time explicating medical content.
   Conclusion: The primacy of information exchange over process-oriented,
   relational communication was demonstrated. Proactive transparency
   appears promising to increase understanding and collaboration.
   Practice implications: In patient-centered care where collaboration is
   the ideal, transparency in its various forms is a critical ingredient.
   Without much communicative effort, physicians who proactively
   communicated that an examination was over, that they were leaving the
   exam room briefly so patients could dress provided information that
   appeared to address patient uncertainty and demonstrated empathy and
   respect. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{On November 2, 2010, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of
   Schwarzenegger v Entertainment Merchants Association, with a ruling
   expected in 2011. This case addressed whether states have the right to
   restrict freedom of speech by limiting the sale of violent video games
   to minors. To date, 8 states have tried to pass legislation to this
   effect, with all attempts being found unconstitutional by lower courts.
   In large part, the Supreme Court's decision will be determined by its
   review and interpretation of the medical and social science literature
   addressing the effects of violent video games on children. Those on both
   sides of the violent video game debate claim that the scientific
   literature supports their opinions. Some involved in the debate have
   proclaimed that the debate is scientifically settled and that only
   people holding personal Interests and biases oppose these ``established
   truths.{''} We review the historical similarities found in the 1950s
   comic book debate and studies identified from a Pub Med search of the
   term violent video games showing both the harmful and beneficial effects
   of these video games. We define factors that physicians need to consider
   when reading and stating opinions about this literature. Opinions from
   past court rulings are discussed to provide Insight Into how judges may
   approach the application of these social science studies to the current
   legal Issue. Although on the surface the case of Schwarzenegger v
   Entertainment Merchants Association pertains only to the restriction of
   violent video games, It may establish principles about how medical and
   public health testimony can affect fundamental constitutional rights and
   how much and on what basis the courts will defer to legislators'
   reliance on unsettled science.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   This paper considers in outline the complexity of the empathic process
   from subjective, philosophical and psychological perspectives, and
   suggests that compassionate empathy is a core requirement of a
   person-centred approach to health care delivery. Empathy is facilitated
   by secure attachments in infancy (intersubjectivity) and a subsequent
   firm sense of self and personal identity. Empathic understanding is
   enhanced by the medical humanities, but the neglect of musical
   appreciation in this regard is surprising.
   Conclusions
   The biopsychosocial model is reviewed, and a body-mind-spirit paradigm
   is proposed as a more optimal framework for health care delivery in a

Abstract = {{Utilizing interviews with students and a key administrator, analyses of
   academic schedules, and observations of courses, labs, and small groups,
   this study examines if and how elements of the explicit preclinical
   curriculum may have deleterious effects on medical students'
   humanitarian attributes, namely empathy. Findings from this case-study
   of a medical school in the United States suggest that the lack of
   frequent formal testing in the psycho-social aspects of patient care
   during the preclinical years, as well as a general reduction in
   curriculum hours devoted to teaching the social aspects of medicine, may
   serve as mechanisms behind the diminution of medical students' levels of
   empathy and other positive attributes as found by previous research.
   Following the basic tenets of the Testing Effect and the assumption that
   assessment drives learning, it is argued that a feasible way to maintain
   and potentially cultivate these traits among medical students, without
   saturating an overwhelmed medical curriculum, would be to install
   periodic, formally graded exams into preclinical curriculums that
   evaluate empathy and the psycho-social aspects of care.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the factors that
   make a good doctor, both from a patient and a physician perspective. Is
   there a connection between practicing homeopathy and being a good
   doctor?
   Methods: This was a qualitative study of homeopathically trained
   physicians and their patients, using observation of patient-physician
   interactions (n = 29) and interviews with patients (n = 20) and with
   physicians (n = 4).
   Results: Patients identified the availability of time, both in itself
   and as a prerequisite for other physician characteristics, as the single
   most important factor. Other factors include scope of diagnosis/holistic
   approach, patient-centeredness/empathy, and perceived
   competence/therapeutic success. Patients did not link these factors to
   the homeopathic orientation of their physician, while physicians clearly
   made this connection.
   Conclusions: The findings confirm other studies of patient satisfaction
   and physician characteristics. The availability of time, a holistic
   approach, and high physician empathy lead to high patient satisfaction.
   Homeopathic physicians probably are more likely to exhibit these
   characteristics.
   Practice implications: Health care policy should create conditions that
   enable individual physicians to be ``good doctors.{''} For medical
   education, a stronger emphasis on interpersonal skills and practitioner
   empathy could lead to higher patient satisfaction and potentially better
   treatment outcomes. Homeopathy might provide a good role model for this
   type of education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the preferences of children with cancer, their
   parents, and survivors of childhood cancer regarding medical
   communication with child patients and variables associated with these
   preferences.
   Methods: Preferences regarding health-care provider empathy in
   consultations, and children's involvement in information exchange and
   medical decision making were investigated by means of vignettes.
   Vignettes are brief descriptions of hypothetical situations, in which
   important factors are systematically varied following an experimental
   design. In total, 1440 vignettes were evaluated by 34 children with
   cancer (aged 8-16), 59 parents, and 51 survivors (aged 8-16 at
   diagnosis, currently aged 10-30). Recruitment of participants took place
   in three Dutch university-based pediatric oncology centers. Data were
   analyzed by multilevel analyses.
   Results: Patients, parents, and survivors indicated the importance of
   health-care providers' empathy in 81\% of the described situations. In
   most situations (70\%), the three respondent groups preferred
   information about illness and treatment to be given to patients and
   parents simultaneously. Preferences regarding the amount of information
   provided to patients varied. The preference whether or not to shield
   patients from information was mainly associated with patients' age and
   emotionality. In most situations (71\%), the three respondent groups
   preferred children to participate in medical decision making. This
   preference was mainly associated with patients' age.
   Conclusions: To be able to adapt communication to parents' and patients'
   preferences, health-care providers should repeatedly assess the
   preferences of both groups. Future studies should investigate how
   health-care providers balance their communication between the sometimes
   conflicting preferences of patients and parents. Copyright (C) 2010 John

Abstract = {{Emotions-one's own and others'-play a large role in the lives of medical
   students. Students must deal with their emotional reactions to

   which they are witness, as well as patients' and patients' family
   members' often intense feelings. Yet, currently few components in formal
   medical training-in either direct curricular instruction or physician

   the author examines patients', medical students', and physician role
   models' emotions in the clinical context, highlighting challenges in all
   three of these arenas. Next, the author asserts that the preponderance
   of medical education continues to address the emotional realm through
   ignoring, detaching from, and distancing from emotions. Finally, she
   presents not only possible theoretical and conceptual models for

Title = {{Humanism at Heart: Preserving Empathy in Third-Year Medical Students}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{350-358}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Research suggests that medical student empathy erodes during
   undergraduate medical education. The authors evaluated the Jefferson
   Scale of Physician Empathy Medical Student Version (JSPE-MS) scores of
   two consecutive medical school classes to assess the impact of an
   educational intervention on the preservation of empathy.
   Method
   The authors conducted a before-and-after study of 209 Robert Wood
   Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) students enrolled in the classes of 2009
   and 2010. Students' clerkships included a mandatory, longitudinal
   ``Humanism and Professionalism{''} (H\&P) component, which included
   blogging about clerkship experiences, debriefing after significant
   events, and discussing journal articles, fiction, and film. Students
   completed the JSPE-MS during their first and last clerkships.
   Results
   The results showed that (1) contrary to previous studies' findings,
   third-year students did not show significant decline in empathy as
   measured by the JSPE-MS (these students, from two consecutive RWJMS
   classes, experienced the H\&P intervention), (2) students selected for
   the Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) were significantly different from
   their peers in empathy scores as measured by JSPE-MS, and (3) knowledge
   of selection for the GHHS seems to positively influence students'
   JSPE-MS scores.
   Conclusions
   Maintaining empathy during the third year of medical school is possible
   through educational intervention. A curriculum that includes safe,
   protected time for third-year students to discuss their reactions to
   patient care situations during clerkships may have contributed to the
   preservation of empathy. Programs designed to validate humanism in
   medicine (such as the GHHS) may reverse the decline in empathy as
   measured by the JSPE-MS.}},

Year = {{2011}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{359-364}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To test the hypothesis that physicians' empathy is associated with
   positive clinical outcomes for diabetic patients.
   Method
   A correlational study design was used in a university-affiliated
   outpatient setting. Participants were 891 diabetic patients, treated
   between July 2006 and June 2009, by 29 family physicians. Results of the
   most recent hemoglobin A1c and LDL-C tests were extracted from the
   patients' electronic records. The results of hemoglobin A1c tests were
   categorized into good control (< 7.0\%) and poor control (> 9.0\%).
   Similarly, the results of the LDL-C tests were grouped into good control
   (< 100) and poor control (> 130). The physicians, who completed the
   Jefferson Scale of Empathy in 2009, were grouped into high, moderate,
   and low empathy scorers. Associations between physicians' level of
   empathy scores and patient outcomes were examined.
   Results
   Patients of physicians with high empathy scores were significantly more
   likely to have good control of hemoglobin A1c (56\%) than were patients
   of physicians with low empathy scores (40\%, P < .001). Similarly, the
   proportion of patients with good LDL-C control was significantly higher
   for physicians with high empathy scores (59\%) than physicians with low
   scores (44\%, P < .001). Logistic regression analyses indicated that
   physicians' empathy had a unique contribution to the prediction of
   optimal clinical outcomes after controlling for physicians' and
   patients' gender and age, and patients' health insurance.
   Conclusions
   The hypothesis of a positive relationship between physicians' empathy
   and patients' clinical outcomes was confirmed, suggesting that
   physicians' empathy is an important factor associated with clinical
   competence and patient outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{AIMS: To describe the involvement and input of physicians and nurses in
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR / do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR)
   decisions; to analyse decision patterns; and understand the practical
   implications.
   DESIGN: A Qualitative Grounded Theory study using one-time open-ended
   interviews with 40 volunteer physicians and 52 nurses drawn from acute
   care wards with mixes of heterogeneous cases in seven different
   hospitals in German-speaking Switzerland.
   RESULTS: Establishing DNAR orders in the best interests of patients was
   described as a challenging task requiring the leadership of senior
   physicians and nurses. Implicit decisions in favour of CPR predominated
   at the beginning of hospitalisation; depending on the context, they were
   relieved/superseded by explicit DNAR decisions. Explicit decisions were
   the result of hierarchical medical expertise, of multilateral
   interdisciplinary expertise, of patient autonomy and/or of negotiated
   patient autonomy. Each type of decision, implicit or explicit,
   potentially represented a team consensus. Non-consensual decisions were
   prone to precipitate personal or team conflicts, and, occasionally, led
   to non-compliance.
   CONCLUSION: Establishing DNAR orders is a demanding task. Reaching a
   consensus is of crucial importance in guaranteeing teamwork and good
   patient care. Communication and negotiation skills, professional and
   personal life experience and empathy for patients and colleagues are
   pivotal. Therefore, leadership by experienced senior physicians and
   nurses is needed and great efforts should be made with regard to
   multidisciplinary education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Patient-centered interviewing is an increasingly important
   aspect of medical education. One way to quantify this skill is the Four
   Habits Model, which helps to organize medical interviewing. The Four
   Habits are: invest in the beginning, elicit the patient's perspective,
   demonstrate empathy and invest in the end. In a previous study at our
   institution, students were competent in all of the habits but
   ``eliciting the patient's perspective{''} during a standardized patient
   case. Based on this study, we hypothesized that the students' poor
   performance could be related to the type of case or to clinical
   experience.
   Methods: We placed three ``eliciting the patient's perspective{''} items
   on the checklist for two standardized patients, one with and one without
   a clear diagnosis. We planned to compare group performance between cases
   and semesters of the third year. We hypothesized that students would be
   more patient-centered earlier in the year and with an ambiguous
   diagnosis.
   Results: Students were more patient-centered with the ambiguous
   diagnosis and later in their third year. Patient-centeredness was
   measured by an eliciting the patient's perspective (EPP) score based on
   the checklist items.
   Conclusion: Our results provide information that may help guide
   curriculum development and future study to advance patient-centered
   interviewing skills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Do psychiatry residents identify as psychotherapists? A multisite survey}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Psychiatric training was once synonymous with learning
   psychotherapy, but current psychiatric trainees face many options for
   integrating psychopharmacology and psychotherapy into their future
   practices, including providing primarily medication-focused visits. We
   examined psychiatry residents' attitudes towards learning psychotherapy,
   practicing psychotherapy in the future, and overall identification as
   psychotherapists.
   METHODS: We surveyed residents from 15 US residency programs during
   2006-2007. The survey included 36 Likert-scaled items inquiring about
   residents' attitudes towards their psychotherapy training and
   supervision, their level of psychotherapy competence, the role of
   psychotherapy in their psychiatric identity, and their future practice
   plans. Four items asked about personal psychotherapy experience. Here we
   describe findings related to attitudes concerning being a
   psychotherapist and future practice plans.
   RESULTS: Among 249 respondents, most (82\%) viewed becoming a
   psychotherapist as integral to their psychiatric identity. Fifty-four
   percent planned to provide formal psychotherapy, whereas 62\%
   anticipated psychopharmacology would be the foundation of treatment for
   most patients. Residents with personal psychotherapy experience and
   first-year postgraduate residents (PGY-1) were more likely to identify
   as psychotherapists, plan to pursue further psychotherapy training
   postresidency, and anticipate psychotherapy being central to their
   future practice.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns about the diminishing role of
   psychotherapy in the practice of psychiatry and in psychiatrists'
   professional identity, most psychiatric residents view psychotherapy as
   integral to their professional identities and future practice plans.}},

Abstract = {{Showing videos of medical consultation as a proxy for participation is
   being increasingly applied in research in order to let patients
   (re-)experience social interaction in medical settings. If subjects do
   indeed experience the interaction process when watching this on video,
   then they should show similar patterns in physiological arousal as when
   actually participating. We assessed whether watching one's own
   interaction in a medical setting on video lead to the same skin
   conductance activity (SC) as when participating in that interaction.
   Fifteen women with fibromyalgia participated in a medical interview and,
   after a break, watched the video of this interview. Skin conductance
   activity was measured throughout the medical interview and, again, while
   the participants watched their own video. Coherence in SC between these
   two conditions was assessed. In eleven subjects (73\%) a significant
   positive coherence between the two measurements was found, indicating
   that watching your own videotaped consultations evokes comparable
   psychophysiological arousal in most but not all participants. This
   physiological coherence might be an indication that people are capable
   of re-experiencing their interaction process by watching replays of
   these situations, although further research is needed. The positive
   coherence also supports skin conductance as a reliable moment-to-moment
   measure for physiological arousal throughout the doctor-patient
   interaction process. The next step should be linking the changes in
   physiological arousal to what exactly is happening at that moment in the
   interaction between doctor and patient This could provide support for
   the validity of experimental designs in which standardized videotaped
   medical visits are shown to patients. More research is needed on
   predictors of (non-) coherence in certain subjects. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is growing interest to understand the role of
   positive psychological features on the outcomes of medical illnesses.
   Unfortunately this topic is less studied in relation to mental health,
   and almost completely neglected in relation to one of the most common
   severe psychiatric illnesses, bipolar disorder. Certain specific
   psychological characteristics, that are generally viewed as valuable and
   beneficial morally or socially, may grow out of the experience of having
   this affective disorder.
   Objective: We describe the sources, research and impact of these
   positive psychological traits in the lives of persons with bipolar
   disorder based on the few published literature available to date. These
   include, but are not limited to: spirituality, empathy, creativity,
   realism, and resilience. Methods: After an extensive search in the
   literature, we found 81 articles that involve descriptions of positive
   psychological characteristics of bipolar disorder.
   Results: We found evidence for enhancement of the five above positive
   psychological traits in persons with bipolar disorder.
   Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is associated with the positive
   psychological traits of spirituality, empathy, creativity, realism, and
   resilience. Clinical and research attention to preserving and enhancing
   these traits may improve outcomes in bipolar disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: A challenging but main task for clinicians is to identify
   patients' concerns related to their medical conditions. The study aim
   was to validate a new coding scheme for identifying patients' cues and
   concerns.
   Methods: 12 videotaped consultations between nurses and pain patients
   were coded according to the Verona Coding Scheme for Emotional Sequences
   (VR-CoDES). During a metainterview each patient watched his/her own
   video interview with the researcher to confirm or disconfirm the
   identified cues and concerns. A directive or an open format was applied.
   Quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed.
   Results: Patients' confirmation in relation to the coding gave a
   sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.99 in the directive format and
   a sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.70 applying the open format.
   Through a qualitative analysis 83\% of researcher-identified cues and
   concerns were validated. 17\% were not confirmed or uncertain.
   Conclusion: The VR-CoDES seems to capture what are experienced as real
   concerns to patients, and proves to be a coding scheme with a high
   degree of ecological validity.
   Practice implications: The VR-CoDES provides a valid framework for
   detecting patients' cues and concerns, and should be explored as a
   training tool to develop clinicians' empathic accuracy. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective: This qualitative study of health care clinicians serving
   women at heightened risk of sexually transmitted infections and
   unintended pregnancy was undertaken to explore concepts underlying
   reproductive health counseling messages in clinical encounters.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 clinicians,
   including physicians and advanced practice nurses serving primarily
   low-income patients in high-risk communities throughout the U.S.
   Results: Most of the clinicians describe their influence on patients and
   protective behaviors as derived from medical authority and the
   presentation of information. The use of a parental style of authority,
   particularly for young or vulnerable patients, and emotional appeals to
   evoke negative emotions, such as fear, were also used to motivate
   protective behaviors. Many clinicians highlighted the importance of
   empathy, and understanding the cultural and social context of health
   behaviors. A few clinicians described innovative efforts to empower
   women to protect themselves and exert more control in relationships.
   Conclusion: Some of the reproductive health counseling approaches
   described by clinicians are not consistent with leading health behavior
   change theories or patient-centered counseling.
   Practical implications: To improve counseling, these messages and
   concepts need to be evaluated for effectiveness, and possibly used to
   inform the development of novel theories for use in reproductive health
   counseling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preoperative stress influences perioperative complications.
   Their severity is influenced by advanced information and previous
   experience. This study evaluates the emotional effects of these factors.
   Methods: In a prospective observational study we documented existing
   anaesthesiological pre-information and previous experience of 461
   patients (255w/206m) individually. In addition, we recorded the
   affective emotional condition of each patient before and after the
   premedication visit via a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a test of
   current stress (KAB).
   Results: 248 patients had previous anaesthesiological pre-information.
   Of those 61 were of a negative nature. These patients showed a
   significantly higher level of stress and anxiety compared to those with
   positive information. 41 of 388 patients reported bad experiences with
   increased anxiety and stress. The premedication visits caused a
   significant attenuation of the overall stress level in patients with
   negative experience/information.
   Conclusion: During the individual premedication visit, patients should
   be asked directly about negative pre-information and perioperative
   experience. Thus the conversation can be customised to the individual
   stress factors and show empathy as well. Independent of any medical
   intervention, this approach can be an effective contribution to stress
   reduction.}},

   empathy}},
Journal = {{HEALTHMED}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{515-521}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Good communication is associated with improved health of patients
   and empathy is a cornerstone of physician-patient communication. Medical
   education seems to be ineffective in helping students to maintain or
   increase their empathy. Some of benefits of Problem Based Learning (PBL)
   are about communication and interpersonal skills. This study aims to
   determine the effect of a PBL scenario on attitudes towards
   communication skills, the empathic tendency and the empathic skills of
   1st year medical students.
   Materials and Methods: Attitude changes after the PBL scenario were
   evaluated via Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS), Empathic
   Tendency Scale (ETS) and Empathic Skill Scale (ESS).
   Results: The positive attitude change was significant for male students
   (p=0.03). The means of ETS scores were 68.42 +/- 8.28 and 69.18 +/- 8.53
   (p=0.36) and the means of ESS scores were 131.16 +/- 17.28 and 133.30
   +/- 18.35 in the pre and post-tests, respectively (p=0.22). The ESS
   scores of male students both in pre and post tests were significantly
   higher than female students (p=0.00). A significant negative correlation
   between NAS and ETS and a positive correlation between PAS and ETS in
   both tests were determined.
   Conclusion: This scenario significantly increased positive attitudes
   (PAS) of students towards communication skills. There was also an
   increase in empathic tendency and skills.}},

Title = {{Qualitative Analysis of Medical Student Impressions of a Narrative
   Exercise in the Third-Year Psychiatry Clerkship}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Clinical clerkship directors and faculty undertake the challenge of
   teaching patient-centered communication to students who face the
   enormous doctor-centered task of learning diagnostic medicine. The
   authors examined students' written reactions to the narrative exercise,
   which, drawing from narrative medicine and narrative therapy, challenges
   students to be more patient-centered by writing a patient's life story
   and sharing it with that patient.
   Method
   During one-half of an academic year (2008-2009), the authors used
   qualitative methods to explore the range of medical student experiences
   with the narrative exercise in the psychiatry clerkship.
   Results
   During the study period, 46 medical students completed the exercise, and
   44 (96\%) submitted 367 comments for the research team to analyze. Four
   broad categories emerged: (1) communication, (2) insight, (3) hope, and
   (4) mixed or negative reactions. The most common theme was improved
   communication, which comprised the subcategories of enhanced active
   listening, opening up, and relationship building. Improved insights
   included student insights into their patients, as well as the
   facilitation of patient insights into themselves, especially regarding
   their own strengths and relationships. The exercise was well received by
   students: Only five comments were categorized as negative, and all of
   these related to difficulties selecting patients.
   Conclusions
   Students reported many examples of improved patient-centered
   communication facilitated by the exercise. The narrative exercise may
   also promote a greater understanding of patients as complete human
   beings rather than diagnostic entities. The approach may be useful in
   educational settings beyond the psychiatry clerkship.}},

Pages = {{1-3}},
Abstract = {{Studies in cognitive psychology inform us that the recall of information
   and its application are best when it is taught and rehearsed in
   environments similar to workplace. The healthcare professions are
   heavily task- and performance-based where non-technical skills, decision
   making and clinical reasoning are important alongside integrity, empathy
   and compassion. Most of these attributes are difficult to teach and
   assess in the traditional classrooms. Enhanced patient safety on one
   hand has to be the ultimate outcome of any medical curriculum while on
   the other hand, it itself can be potentially compromised in an
   apprenticeship-based model of medical education. A range of simulation
   techniques are very well placed to be used alongside clinical
   placements. These can be employed to enhance learning of healthcare
   professionals in safe environments, without compromising the patient
   safety, while maintaining a high degree of realism. This article builds
   an argument for the use of simulation techniques to enhance patient
   safety and points the readers to the AMEE Guide No. 50<SU1</SU on
   simulation, which is written as a practical manual on building a
   simulation programme in healthcare education.</.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{39-43}},
Abstract = {{Background: John Wooden, the legendary college basketball coach, created
   the ``Pyramid of Success{''}, which he constructed from 14 timeless
   character traits and interpersonal skills that are critical to
   competitive greatness. Wooden's pyramid is a powerful symbol that he and
   others have used for several decades as an educational tool to promote
   leadership and teamwork.
   Aim: This article proposes the ``Pyramid of Relational Excellence
   (PRE){''}, patterned after Wooden's pyramid, as a mnemonic-based
   educational symbol for communication skills training.
   Method: Literature review, personal reflection.
   Results: The PRE is constructed of four tiers with a total of 12
   building blocks, with each successive tier built upon the one beneath
   it. The building blocks represent fundamental elements that are known to
   be critical to successful communication.
   Conclusions: The PRE is process oriented rather than task oriented and
   focuses exclusively on the face-to-face encounter. It therefore
   complements established communications curricula, such as the UK
   communication wheel and others, which are more comprehensive and task
   oriented. The PRE is constructed of timeless, fundamental principles. It
   is therefore particularly well suited for training medical students and
   residents.}},

   Methods: A total of 248 third-year medical students completed the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE). SPs completed the Jefferson
   Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE), and a global
   rating of empathy in 10 objective clinical skills examination encounters

   Results: High correlation was found between the scores on the JSPPPE and
   the global ratings of empathy completed by the SPs (r=0.87, p<0.01). A
   moderate but statistically significant correlation was observed between
   scores of the JSPE and the JSPPPE (r=0.19, p<0.05). Significant

Abstract = {{Background: The communication of empathy is key in physician-patient
   interactions. We introduced drama training in ``How to act-in-role'' to
   medical students and evaluated the effect of this.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental design was employed, with 72 students in
   the control and 77 students in the intervention group. The students'
   empathy scores were obtained using the Jefferson Scale of Physician
   Empathy (JSPE) during the introductory course. Both groups received
   tutorials in motivational interviewing and brief intervention skills.
   The students in the intervention group also received training in ``How
   to act-in-role''. The JSPE was repeated for both groups. The students
   subsequently undertook observed structured clinical examinations (OSCE).
   Both tutors and students evaluated the student's OSCE performance as
   well as their motivational interviewing skills using the Behavior Change
   Counseling Index (BECCI).
   Results: Our findings show that while the students in both groups did
   not significantly differ in baseline empathy scores, the intervention
   group reported significantly higher empathy scores post-intervention.
   The intervention group also received significantly higher tutor ratings
   for their motivational interviewing (BECCI score) and overall OSCE
   performances. In conclusion, the teaching innovation ``How to
   act-in-role'' was effective not only in increasing medical students'
   self-reported empathy but also their competence in consultation skills.}},

   proficiency for effective communication with patients, families and the
   healthcare team.
   Methods: First-year students experience a graduated curriculum of three
   sessions on themes such as empathy and professionalism using innovative
   methods. Sessions highlight cases and videos depicting successful and
   ineffective interactions, large and small group discussions, role play
   and skills practice, guest patient presentations, and multi-disciplinary
   panels. The second-year students' session focuses on communications with
   challenging patients.
   Results: Students and faculty rate the sessions highly on effectiveness
   of enhancing communication skills, gaining perspective in healthcare
   communication, and appreciating the complexities of healthcare
   situations. Expansion of the program using case-based sessions for
   clerkship students is planned for a continuous and graduated experience.
   Conclusions: Integrating a pre-clerkship communications curriculum may
   help improve future physicians' interactions with patients and families.
   Implications of this curriculum for medical education are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Physician empathy and relational skills are critical factors predicting
   quality of care, patient safety, patient satisfaction, and decreasing
   malpractice claims. Studies indicate that physician empathy declines
   throughout medical training, yet little is published about methods to
   enhance empathy, especially in surgical residency training. The
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires
   competencies in 6 areas, including interpersonal skills and
   communication. To address this important problem, the first author
   developed an innovative empathy-relational skills training protocol
   focusing on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of empathy and the
   interpersonal processes that positively affect the patient-doctor
   relationship. The authors tested the effectiveness of this protocol in a
   pilot study with 11 otolaryngology residents. Results showed that a
   brief series of 3 empathy training sessions can significantly improve
   physicians' knowledge of the neurobiology and physiology of empathy, as
   well as their self-reported capacity to empathize with patients. A trend
   toward increased patient satisfaction was observed.}},

   Curriculum Knowledge with Emotional and Reflective Development}},
Journal = {{PAIN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{186-195}},
Abstract = {{Objective.
   Improvements in clinical pain care have not matched advances in
   scientific knowledge, and innovations in medical education are needed.
   Several streams of evidence indicate that pain education needs to
   address both the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain. Our aim was
   to design and deliver a new course in pain establishing foundation-level
   knowledge while comprehensively addressing the emotional development
   needs in this area.
   Setting.
   One hundred eighteen first-year medical students at Johns Hopkins School
   of Medicine.
   Outcome Measures.
   Performance was measured by multiple-choice tests of pain knowledge,
   attendance, reflective pain portfolios, and satisfaction measures.
   Results.
   Domains of competence in pain knowledge included central and peripheral
   pain signalling, pharmacological management of pain with standard
   analgesic medications, neuromodulating agents, and opioids; cancer pain,
   musculoskeletal pain, nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic, geriatric,
   and pediatric pain. Socio-emotional development (portfolio) work focused
   on increasing awareness of pain affect in self and others, and on
   enhancing the commitment to excellence in pain care. Reflections
   included observations on a brief pain experience (cold pressor test),
   the multidimensionality of pain, the role of empathy and compassion in
   medical care, the positive characteristics of pain-care role models, the
   complex feelings engendered by pain and addiction including frustration
   and disappointment, and aspirations and commitments in clinical
   medicine. The students completing feedback expressed high levels of
   interest in pain medicine as a result of the course.
   Discussion.
   We conclude that a 4-day pain course incorporating sessions with pain
   specialists, pain medicine knowledge, and design-built elements to
   strengthen emotional skills is an effective educational approach.
   Summary.
   Innovations in medical education about pain are needed. Our aim was to
   design and deliver a new course for medical students addressing both the
   affective and cognitive dimensions of pain. Combining small-group
   sessions with pain specialists, active-learning approaches to pain
   knowledge, and design-built elements to strengthen emotional skills was
   highly effective.}},

Journal = {{PAIN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{854-863}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Online learning is an efficient new educational method that
   is able to link teachers with geographically dispersed students and
   capture the interest of students with interactive materials. Our
   objective was to describe curricula of new Web-based electives about
   pain for undergraduate medical education.
   Design. We created three interactive Web-based elective courses about
   pain targeted to medical and dental students. ``The Puzzle of Pain{''}
   course introduced basic concepts of pain and neurobiology of pain. The
   humanities-based curriculum of ``Empathy and Pain{''} taught students
   about emotional aspects of pain and empathetic responses. ``The Cochrane
   Library and Pain{''} course introduced students to the concept of
   evidence-based medicine, critical appraisal of the literature, and the
   hierarchy of evidence in medicine.
   Outcome Measures. We measured program effectiveness with a
   pretest/posttest instrument and student satisfaction survey.
   Results. Mean knowledge scores increased significantly after the program
   and overall evaluations were positive.
   Conclusions. Delivering the pain electives for medical students in an
   online format was an efficient educational method, with high student
   satisfaction scores. Medical educators should consider online electives
   for medical students in pain studies as well as in other content areas.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with advanced cancer often experience negative emotion;
   clinicians' empathic responses can alleviate patient distress. Much is
   known about how physicians respond to patient emotion; less is known
   about non-physician clinicians. Given that oncology care is increasingly
   provided by an interdisciplinary team, it is important to know more
   about how patients with advanced cancer express emotions to
   non-physician clinicians (NPCs) and how NPCs respond to those empathic
   opportunities.
   We audio recorded conversations between non-physician clinicians and
   patients with advanced cancer. We analyzed 45 conversations between
   patients and oncology physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and
   nurse clinicians in which patients or their loved ones expressed at
   least one negative emotion to the NPC (i.e., an empathic opportunity).
   Empathic opportunities were coded three ways: type of emotion (anger,
   sadness, or fear), severity of emotion (least, moderate, or most
   severe), and NPC response to emotion (not empathic, on-topic medical
   response, and empathic response).
   We identified 103 empathic opportunities presented to 25 different NPCs
   during 45 visits. Approximately half of the empathic opportunities
   contained anger (53\%), followed by sadness (25\%) and fear (21\%). The
   majority of emotions expressed were moderately severe (73\%), followed
   by most severe (16\%), and least severe (12\%). The severity of emotions
   presented was not found to be statistically different between types of
   NPCs. NPCs responded to empathic opportunities with empathic statements
   30\% of the time. Additionally, 40\% of the time, NPCs responded to
   empathic opportunities with on-topic, medical explanations and 30\% of
   the responses were not empathic.
   Patients expressed emotional concerns to NPCs typically in the form of
   anger; most emotions were moderately severe, with no statistical
   differences among types of NPC. On average, NPCs responded to patient
   emotion with empathic language only 30\% of the time. A better
   understanding of NPC-patient interactions can contribute to improved
   communication training for NPCs and, ultimately, to higher quality
   patient care in cancer.}},

Title = {{Assessing Quality of Educational Service by the SERVQUAL model:
   Viewpoints of Paramedical Students at Tehran University of Medical

Abstract = {{Introduction: Understanding how the students' expectations about the
   process of educational services is being met, plays an important role in
   improving the quality education and academic services in the higher
   learning institutes; because by determining the probable gaps between
   the expectations and perceptions of students, necessary actions can be
   undertaken to enhance the quality of educational services.
   Purpose: This study intends to determine the quality gap in educational
   services provided to the paramedical students in Tehran University of
   Medical Sciences in 2010.
   Method: The study was a cross sectional research that used standard
   SERVQUAL questionnaire to collect data from paramedical students of the
   school of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical
   Sciences. A total of 135 responses were analyzed to identify the quality
   gap in educational services.
   Findings: Results show that there is a negative quality gap in all five
   dimensions of quality educational services (empathy, physical,
   responsiveness, assurance and confidence). The maximum and minimum mean
   of quality gap observed in the dimension of empathy and assurance was
   -1.57 and -1.31 respectively. Moreover, a statistically significant
   difference was observed between the five dimensions of educational
   services in the quality gap (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: According to the results, it is recommended that in order to
   reduce the gap and improve the quality of educational services,
   attention should be paid to all aspects of service quality, particularly
   to the empathy dimension. It is also suggested that proper planning is
   needed to better serve employees and increase their communication
   skills, in order to help reduce the educational quality gap.
   Originality/value: The concept of service quality assessment through
   SERVQUAL is a relatively new effort among Iranian universities, and
   there is lack of previous published literature using this method to
   assess the quality of educational services. Thus, this paper can be used
   as a guide for universities and academic institutes who seek to identify
   the educational quality gap in order to improve upon it.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Early introduction of a full-day human factors training
   experience into the surgical clerkship curriculum will teach effective
   communication skills and strategies to gain professional satisfaction
   from a career in surgery.
   Design: In pilot 1, which took place between July 1, 2007, and December
   31, 2008, 50 students received training and 50 did not; all received
   testing at the end of the rotation for comparison of control vs
   intervention group performance. In pilot 2, a total of 50 students were
   trained and received testing before and after rotation to examine
   individual change over time.
   Setting: University of Massachusetts Medical School.
   Participants: A total of 148 third-year medical students in required
   12-week surgical clerkship rotations.
   Interventions: Full-day training with lecture and small-group exercises,
   cotaught by surgeons and educators, with focus on empathetic
   communication, time management, and teamwork skills.
   Main Outcome Measures: Empathetic communication skill, teamwork, and
   patient safety attitudes and selfreported use of time management
   strategies.
   Results: Empathy scores were not higher for trained vs untrained groups
   in pilot 1 but improved from 2.32 to 3.45 on a 5-point scale (P < .001)
   in pilot 2. Students also were more likely to ask for the nurse's
   perspective and to seek agreement on an action plan after team
   communication training (pilot 1, f = 7.52, P =. 007; pilot 2, t = 2.65,
   P =. 01). Results were mixed for work-life balance, with some trained
   groups scoring significantly lower than untrained groups in pilot 1 and
   no significant improvement shown in pilot 2.
   Conclusions: The significant increase in student-patient communication
   scores suggests that a brief focused presentation followed by simulation
   of difficult patient encounters can be successful. A video demonstration
   can improve interdisciplinary teamwork.}},

Abstract = {{The renewal of primary care waits just ahead. The patient-centered
   medical home (PCMH) movement and a refreshing breeze of collaboration
   signal its arrival with demonstration projects and pilots appearing
   across the country. An early message from this work suggests that the
   development of collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams may be essential
   for the success of the PCMH. Our focus in this article is on training
   existing health care professionals toward being thriving members of this
   transformed clinical care team in a relationship-centered PCMH. Our
   description of the optimal conditions for collaborative training begins
   with delineating three types of teams and how they relate to levels of
   collaboration. We then describe how to create a supportive, safe
   learning environment for this type of training, using a different model
   of professional socialization, and tools for building culture. Critical
   skills related to practice development and the cross-disciplinary
   collaborative processes are also included. Despite significant obstacles
   in readying current clinicians to be members of thriving collaborative
   teams, a few next steps toward implementing collaborative training
   programs for existing professionals are possible using competency-based
   and adult learning approaches. Grasping the long awaited arrival of
   collaborative primary health care will also require delivery system and
   payment reform. Until that happens, there is an abundance of work to be
   done envisioning new collaborative training programs and initiating a
   nation-wide effort to motivate and reeducate our colleagues.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate the empathic skills and the empathetic tendency of
   nursing students throughout their years of undergraduate education.
   Background: Empathy is a major component of the relationships between
   patients and nurses, and is an observable and teachable skill that
   nurses are claimed to possess.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed to determine the
   differences in the empathic skills and tendency of nursing students in
   the successive years of undergraduate nursing education. A longitudinal
   study was also designed to evaluate the changes between the beginning
   and the end of the nursing education in the same group. All the
   registered students were asked to participate in the study. The total
   population was 466 nursing students of whom 438 participated (94\%) in
   the cross-sectional study and 81 in the longitudinal study. The Empathic
   Communication Skills Scale (ECSS) and the Empathic Tendency Scale (ETS)
   were used to collect data.
   Findings: An increase in the ECSS and a decrease in the ETS were
   observed in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Comparing
   the years, fourth-year students have higher empathic skills level,
   whereas newly registered students have a higher empathic tendency score
   (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The findings have shown that empathic skills developed
   during undergraduate nursing education. However, empathetic tendency has
   shown a decline during these educational years. The decrease in
   empathetic tendency during undergraduate education should be taken into
   account, and educators and researchers should consider possible reasons
   for this outcome. Further research is indicated.}},
