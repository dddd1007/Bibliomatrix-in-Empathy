Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: When told the harsh truth about severe disease, a
   patient might despair and lose all hope. Without knowing the truth,
   however, the patient cannot participate in decision making and adjust
   life according to his illness. The present study aims to analyze the
   relationships between hope and truth in the decision on how much
   information to disclose to a patient with severe gastrointestinal
   disease. Methods: The decision analysis is based on the economic
   concepts of indifference curves and utility function. An inverse linear
   relationship exists between hope and truth; as more truth becomes
   revealed, the amount of hope declines. The utility function and the
   corresponding indifference curve of hope plotted versus truth describe
   the patient's personal choices among different combinations of hope and
   truth. The optimal choice among various combinations of hope and truth
   corresponds with the point at which the inverse hope-truth line meets
   the indifference curve. Results: In situations in which hope drops
   steeply as more medical facts are being revealed, the utility to the
   patient is maximized with less truth being told. With a less pronounced
   truth-related decline in hope, utility is maximized at higher levels of
   truth, and, occasionally, utility is maximized only after all medical
   facts have been disclosed. The lesser the impact of truth on hope, the
   more truth is being tolerated. Conclusions: A caring gastroenterologist
   trying to optimize his/her patient's well-being should try to assess the
   potential influence of truth on the patient's psyche and dispense it
   accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Caring for dying persons requires skill in interpersonal aspects of
   care, which may be difficult to teach using conventional educational
   methods. The Pulitzer Prize-winning play Wit relates the personal story
   of a patient dying from metastatic ovarian cancer and describes the
   protagonist's experience with medical care from diagnosis to death.
   Members of the Department of Medicine at the VA Greater Los Angeles
   Health care System and the David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA
   developed a program that utilized Wit to educate medical students,
   residents, and staff providers in the humanistic elements of end-of-life
   care.
   Between February 2000 and January 2002 the Wit Educational Initiative
   organized on-site readings of Wit by local professional theatre
   companies at medical centers throughout the United States and Canada,
   inviting medical students, housestaff, and other providers to attend the
   play followed by structured discussions of the play's themes. The
   Initiative provided extensive support for potential program sites
   including publicity, providing a handbook with a step-by-step guide to
   organizing local programs, and feedback of postperformance survey
   results.
   The Initiative was successful in organizing performances at 32 out of 54
   (59\%) medical centers where a local production of Wit was identified.
   Survey respondents confirmed the appeal, emotional impact, and perceived
   relevance of drama in end-of-life education. An educational program
   using theatre to educate trainees in the humanistic aspects of
   end-of-life care was enthusiastically received by medical schools and
   rated highly by attendees.}},

   teachers should provide students with a framework that will enable them

Volume = {{79}},

Pages = {{351-356}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Reflective writing is one established method for teaching medical
   students empathetic interactions with patients. Most Such exercises rely
   on students' reflecting upon clinical experiences. To effectively
   elicit, interpret, and translate the patient's story, however, a
   reflective practitioner must also be self-aware, personally and
   professionally. Race, gender, and other embodied sources of identity of
   practitioners and patients have been shown to influence the nature of
   clinical communication. Yet, although medical practice is dedicated to
   examining, diagnosing, and treating bodies, the relationship of
   physicians to their own physicality is vexed. Medical training creates a
   dichotomy whereby patients are identified by their bodies while
   physicians' bodies are secondary to physicians' minds. As a result,
   little opportunity is afforded to physicians to deal with personal
   illness experiences, be they their own or those of loved ones.
   This article describes a reflective writing exercise conducted in a
   second-year medical student humanities seminar. The ``personal illness
   narrative{''} exercise created a medium for students to elicit,
   interpret, and translate their personal illness experiences while
   witnessing their colleagues' stories. Qualitative analysis of students'
   evaluation comments indicated that the exercise, although emotionally
   challenging, was well received and highly recommended for other students
   and residents. The reflective writing exercise may be incorporated into
   medical curricula aimed at increasing trainees' empathy. Affording
   Students and residents an opportunity to describe and share their
   illness experiences may counteract the traditional distancing of
   physicians' minds from their bodies and lead to more empathic and
   self-aware practice.}},

   approach. Two main categories of themes emerged: (1) those ``outside{''}
   the consultation, related to expectations, initially formed from
   experiences of family and friends, but then strengthened by ongoing
   attendance at GHH; and (2) themes ``inside{''} the consultation
   including length of consultations, the whole-person approach, being
   treated as an individual, and telling and having their ``story{''}
   listened to in depth. Equality of relationship, mutual respect, and
   sharing decisions were also prominent themes. In conclusion, patients
   attending the GHH highly value the holistic approach, and view time,
   empathy, and the therapeutic relationship as being of key importance.

Abstract = {{In view of many changes taking place in today's health care marketplace,
   the theme of empathy in health provider-patient relations needs to be
   revisited. It has been proposed that patients benefit when all members
   of the health care team provide empathic care. Despite the role of
   empathy in patient outcomes, empirical research on empathy among health
   professionals is scarce partly because of a lack of a psychometrically
   sound tool to measure it. In this study, we briefly describe the
   development and validation of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE), an instrument that was specifically developed to measure empathy
   among health professionals (20 Likert-type items). The purpose of this
   study was to compare nurses anti physicians on their responses to the
   JSPE. Study participants were 56 female registered nurses and 42 female
   physicians in the Internal Medicine postgraduate medical education
   program at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. The reliability
   coefficients (Chronbach's coefficient alpha) were 0.87 for the nurses
   and 0.89 for physicians. Results of t test showed no significant
   difference between nurses and physicians on total scores of the JSPE;
   however, multivariate analyses of variance indicated statistically
   significant differences between the two groups on 5 of 20 items of the
   JSPE. Findings suggest that the JSPE is a reliable research tool that
   can be used to assess empathy among health professionals including
   nurses.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical decision making can be described as answering one question:
   ``What is the best next thing for this patient at this time?{''} In
   addition to incorporating clinical information, research evidence, and
   patient preferences, the process requires considering contextual factors
   that are unique to each patient and relevant to their care. The failure
   to do so, thereby compromising that care, can be called a ``contextual
   error.{''} Although proponents of evidence-based clinical decision
   making and many scholars of the medical interview emphasize the
   importance of individualizing care, no operational definition is
   provided for the concept, nor is any methodology proposed for the
   interpretation of clinically relevant patient-specific variables. By
   conceptualizing the physician-patient encounter as a
   participant-observer case study with an N of 1, this essay describes how
   existing approaches to studying social systems can provide clinicians
   with a systematic approach to individualizing their clinical decision
   making.}},

   phenomenological analysis of written narratives.
   The process of developing an awareness of personal values through
   empathizing with patients was identified as the core theme of the
   students' experience. Six more common themes were identified.
   Development of the students' moral awareness was conceptualized as a set
   of stages, commencing with empathizing with patients and nurses, moving
   on to taking a moral stand and, finally, concluding by becoming aware of
   their personal values and showing evidence of an emerging professional
   moral personhood. The notions of empathy, caring and emotion were in
   evidence throughout the students' experience. Implications for practice

   differences by gender, age, and training.
   Methods: A survey was created that assesses empathy, spirituality,
   wellness, and tolerance in the medical setting. Surveys were completed
   anonymously by medical students and practitioners from the medical
   school.
   Results: The youngest groups scored highest on empathy and wellness and
   lowest on tolerance. Participation in medical school wellness sessions
   correlated with higher empathy and wellness scores; participation in
   both empathy and spirituality sessions correlated with higher empathy
   scores.
   Conclusion: Exposure to educational activities in empathy, philosophical
