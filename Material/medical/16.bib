Abstract = {{The 2007 Streeten Lecture focused on the idea that physical
   deconditioning plays a key role in the symptomology and pathophysiology
   of POTS. Parallels were drawn between the physiological responses to
   orthostatic stress seen in POTS patients and the physiological responses
   seen in ``normal{''} humans after prolonged periods of bedrest,
   deconditioning, or space flight. Additionally, the idea that endurance
   exercise training might ameliorate some of these symptoms was also
   advanced. Finally, potential parallels between POTS, chronic fatigue
   syndrome, and fibromyalgia were also drawn and the potential role of
   exercise training as a ``therapeutic intervention{''} in all three
   conditions was raised. The conceptual model for the lecture was that
   after some ``initiating event{''} chronic deconditioning plays a
   significant role in the pathophysiology of these conditions, and these
   physiological changes in conjunction with ``somatic hypervigilence{''}
   explain many of the complaints that this diverse group of patients have.
   Additionally, the idea that systematic endurance exercise training might
   be helpful was advanced, and data supportive of this idea was reviewed.
   The main conclusion is that the medical community must retain their
   empathy for patients with unusual conditions but at the same time send a
   firm but empowering message about physical activity. As always, we must
   also ask what do the ideas about physical activity and inactivity and
   the conditions mentioned above not explain?.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate structural and psychological factors that lead
   non-urgent patients to choose the Accidents \& Emergency Department
   (A\&ED) rather than primary care services.
   Data sources: Data were collected through interviews by means of a
   structured questionnaire. Data regarding the A\&ED sample were also
   drawn from the database of the department.
   Study design: Hypotheses were tested in a survey comparing A\&ED
   non-urgent patients and patients using GP surgeries. Different
   perceptions of the characteristics of A\&ED and primary care services
   were measured and a perceptual map was created using the linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA).
   Data collection: Emergency services users were interviewed in the A\&ED
   of the General Hospital of the Province of Macerata (Italy). Primary
   care users were interviewed in four GP surgeries. 527 patients were
   interviewed between December 2006 and February 2007.
   Principal findings: A\&ED and primary care patients look for different
   characteristics as diagnostic and therapeutic potentialities, empathy
   and competence, quick access or long-lasting relationship. Information
   asymmetry explains part of the behaviour. Conclusions: Use of A\&ED
   services for non-urgent care can be reduced.
   The understanding of reasons underlying the choice and a change in
   access, timing and contents of care/services provided by general
   practitioners (GPs) might provide incentives for shifting from A\&ED to
   GPs surgeries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: The hidden (informal) curriculum is blamed for its
   negative effects on students' humanism and professional development. To
   combat this, educational initiatives employing mentored reflective
   practice, faculty role-modeling, and feedback have been advocated.
   AIM: Promote reflection on professional development using collaborative,
   web-based technology.
   SETTING: Four-week basic medicine clerkship rotation at an academic
   institution over a one-year period.
   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Students were asked to contribute two reflective
   postings to a class web log (blog) during their rotation. They were able
   to read each other's postings and leave feedback in a comment section.
   An instructor provided feedback on entries, aimed to stimulate further
   reflection. Students could choose anonymous names if desired.
   PROGRAM EVALUATION: Ninety-one students wrote 177 posts. One-third of
   students left feedback comments. The majority of students enjoyed the
   activity and found the instructor's feedback helpful. Assessment of the
   posts revealed reflections on experience, heavily concerned with
   behavior and affect. A minority were not reflective. In some cases, the
   instructor's feedback stimulated additional reflection. Certain posts
   provided insight to the hidden curriculum.
   DISCUSSION: We have discovered that blogs can promote reflection,
   uncover elements of the hidden curriculum, and provide opportunities to
   promote professional development.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Instruments are needed to measure the influence of cancer on quality of
   life in the expanding population of long-term cancer survivors. We
   conducted refinement and psychometric evaluation of the Impact of Cancer
   (IOC) scale by use of data from a large sample of long-term breast
   cancer survivors and developed an instrument, the Impact of Cancer
   version 2 (IOCv2), to measure quality of life outcomes.
   Methods
   Questionnaires including 81 potential IOC scale items, the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Breast Cancer
   Prevention Trial (BCPT) symptom scales, as well as demographic,
   treatment, and medical information, were completed by 1188 disease-free
   breast cancer survivors 5-10 years after diagnosis. We used exploratory
   factor analysis to identify scales and assessed reproducibility by
   split-sample cross-validation. Higher-order scales were extracted and
   all scales were evaluated for internal consistency and construct and
   concurrent validity.
   Results
   The analysis yielded a factor structure relating IOC items to
   psychosocial impact domains that exhibited high factor loadings
   (factor-item correlations of 0.59-0.94), high internal consistency
   (Cronbach's alpha statistics of 0.76-0.89), and a total congruence of
   0.98 across the split samples. The Impact of Cancer version 2 (IOCv2)
   scales consist of a Positive Impact Summary scale with four subscales
   (Altruism and Empathy, Health Awareness, Meaning of Cancer, and Positive
   Self-Evaluation), a Negative Impact Summary scale with four subscales
   (Appearance Concerns, Body Change Concerns, Life Interferences, and
   Worry), and subscales for Employment and Relationship Concerns. Patterns
   of association between IOCv2 scale scores and CES-D and BCPT scores
   indicated good concurrent validity. Patterns of associations between
   IOCv2 scale scores and demographic, medical, and treatment
   characteristics indicated good construct validity.
   Conclusion
   The IOCv2 scales provide a validated tool for measuring the impact of
   cancer on quality of life in long-term cancer survivors.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE The treatment a patient receives is greatly affected by what he
   or she chooses to disclose to a physician. This qualitative study
   investigated such factors as culture and background that contribute to
   Latina patients' nondisclosure of medical information.
   METHODS Participants were 28 Latina women living in Brooklyn. in-depth
   interviews in English or Spanish were conducted and documented by
   extensive notes. We used a grounded theory approach to find emerging
   themes, which were coded using a continuous iterative process.
   RESULTS Six primary themes emerged: the physician-patient relationship,
   language, physician sex and age, time constraints, sensitive health
   issues, and culture and birthplace. Such qualities as compassion,
   caring, human interest, and kindness were important to many Latinas, who
   did not feel safe sharing information if these qualities were absent.
   Language barriers caused problems with physician-patient interaction,
   which were complicated by the presence of a translator. Physicians being
   male or younger could make disclosure difficult, especially around
   issues of sexuality and genital examination. Time constraints and
   cultural differences sometimes resulted in physicians' lack of awareness
   of sensitive areas that patients did not wish to discuss, such as
   sexuality, family planning, domestic abuse, and use of recreational
   drugs. Birthplace (foreign born vs US born) played a role in how the
   women perceived barriers to disclosure.
   CONCLUSIONS Staff training in techniques for building rapport can foster
   better communication, increase empathy and compassion, and lead to the
   establishment of trusting relationships in which disclosure is more
   likely. Ann Fam Med 2008;6:543-549. DOI: 10.1370/afm.912.}},

Abstract = {{On the night of August 19, 2000, at the foot of Castel del Monte, an
   8-year-old girl was brutally murdered. The perpetrators were identified
   as five young men who captured their victim and sexually abused her. The
   policemen found the cadaver by following ``Mario,{''} one of the five,
   who had been discovered lying on the ground, near the castle.
   Investigation led to demonstrate that the murder was not premeditated.
   The only desire of the group was to sexually molest the little girl.
   Mario showed signs of psychiatric pathology and for that he underwent
   psychiatric evaluation by judicial authorities. Analysis of this case,
   combined with a criminological and medical-legal perspective led to
   conclusions very much different from the expectations of Mario's defense
   attorneys. Mario, a marginal figure and seemingly the least intelligent,
   played the role of group instigator, both in the initiation of sexually
   abusing the child, as well as in the elimination of an inconvenient
   witness. However, the group was able to activate Mario's sadistic
   fantasies and his sexual perversions, and he ended up in a catalyzing
   role influencing the behavior of others and realizing what would
   otherwise remain only fantasies. The circularity of the group allows
   people like Mario, who are apparently subordinate, to influence the
   behavior of others. Mario was found to have a mental disorder but it was
   not sufficient to diminish his personal responsibility related to the
   crime. In fact, according to Italian judicial code, it is necessary that
   the motivation for the crime was psychopathological. It was for this
   reason that, according to Italian law, all of the members of the group
   were considered to be responsible for the crimes committed and were
   condemned.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{975-983}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The overarching goal of medical training is to nurture the growth of
   knowledgeable, caring, and insightful clinicians guided by the ideals of
   medical professionalism. Recent definitions of professional competence
   identify essential clinical skills, including cognitive expertise,
   emotional competence, and reflective capacity. This modern framework
   reflects the increasingly complex nature of the patient-clinician
   interaction, in which the clinician must exchange diagnostic information
   while supportively engaging the patient on a deeper, affective level.
   The affective dimension can be particularly potent when pain is the
   primary symptom, as it is for the majority of medical visits.
   Unfortunately, however, current models of professionalism, used as an
   early guide for medical trainees to develop an understanding of the
   clinical exchange, largely focus on interactions in the cognitive
   domain. To emphasize the importance of emotions in professional
   development, we propose the Cognitive and Emotional Preparedness Model,
   which describes the clinical encounter occurring on two channels, one
   cognitive and the other emotional, and stresses the importance of
   multidimensional development in preparing the clinician to (1)
   communicate clinical information, (2) provide emotional support, and (3)
   actively reflect on experiences for continued improvement. Together,
   acquisition of knowledge, emotional development, and reflective skill
   will improve the clinical interaction.
   Perspective: The proficiency of medical trainees in developing clinical
   skills profoundly shapes patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes.
   This article reviews the cognitive, emotional, and reflective
   development of medical trainees and presents a model illustrating how
   clinical development impacts pain care. For improved efficacy, pain
   education should be calibrated to students' developmental needs. (C)

Title = {{Providers' perceptions of relationships and professional roles when
   caring for patients who leave the hospital against medical advice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1698-1707}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Patients who leave hospitals against medical advice (AMA)
   may be at risk for adverse health outcomes. Their decision to leave may
   not be clearly understood by providers. This study explored providers'
   experiences with and attitudes toward patients who leave the hospital
   AMA.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore providers' experiences with and attitudes toward
   patients who leave the hospital AMA.
   METHODS: We conducted interviews with university-based internal medicine
   residents and practicing internal medicine clinicians caring for
   patients at a community hospital from July 2006 to August 2007. We
   approached 34 providers within 3 days of discharging a patient AMA. The
   semi-structured instrument elicited perceptions of care, emotions, and
   challenges faced when caring for patients who leave AMA. Using an
   editing analysis style, investigators independently coded transcripts,
   agreeing on the coding template and its application.
   PARTICIPANTS: All 34 providers (100\%) participated. Providers averaged
   32.6 years of age, 22 (61\%) were men, 20 (59\%) were housestaff from
   three residency programs, 13 (38\%) were faculty, hospitalist
   physicians, or chief residents serving as ward attendings, and one (3\%)
   was a physician assistant.
   MAIN RESULTS: Four themes emerged: 1) providers' beliefs that patients
   lack insight into their medical conditions; 2) suboptimal communication,
   mistrust, and conflict; 3) providers' attempts to empathize with
   patients' concerns; and 4) providers' professional roles and obligations
   toward patients who leave AMA.
   CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that patients who leave AMA influence
   providers' perceptions of their patients' insight, and their own
   patient-provider communication, empathy for patients, and professional
   roles and obligations. Future research should investigate educational
   interventions to optimize patient-centered communication and support
   providers in their decisional conflicts when these challenging
   patient-provider discussions occur.}},

Title = {{Missed opportunities for interval empathy in lung cancer communication}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{168}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{1853-1858}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important in patient-physician communication and
   is associated with improved patient satisfaction and adherence to
   physicians' recommendations.
   Methods: To evaluate empathic opportunities and physician responses, we
   conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of 20 audiorecorded,
   transcribed consultations between patients with lung cancer and their
   thoracic surgeons or oncologists, from a larger observational study of
   137 patients in a Veterans Affairs hospital in the southern United
   States. Using qualitative analysis, we collaboratively developed themes
   and subthemes until saturation. Then, each transcript was coded, using
   grounded theory methods, until consensus was achieved, counting and
   sequentially analyzing patient empathic opportunities and physician
   responses.
   Results: Subthemes regarding patients' statements about lung cancer
   included (1) morbidity or mortality concerns, (2) cancer-related
   symptoms, (3) relationship to smoking, (4) decisions about treatment,
   (5) beliefs about or mistrust of medical care, (6) factors limiting
   ability to treat cancer, and (7) confusion regarding cancer status and
   treatment. We identified 384 empathic opportunities and found that
   physicians had responded empathically to 39 (10\%) of them. Otherwise,
   physicians provided little emotional support, often shifting to
   biomedical questions and statements. We defined this phenomenon as
   missed opportunities for ``interval empathy.{''} When empathy was
   provided, 50\% of these statements occurred in the last one-third of the
   encounter, whereas patients' concerns were evenly raised throughout the
   encounter.
   Conclusions: Physicians rarely responded empathically to the concerns
   raised by patients with lung cancer, and empathic responses that did
   occur were more frequently in the last third of the encounter. Our
   results may provide a typologic approach to help physicians recognize
   empathic opportunities and with further development may aid in improving
   physicians' communication skills.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the prevalence of suicidal ideation
   among U.S. medical students or how it relates to burnout.
   Objective: To assess the frequency of suicidal ideation among medical
   students and explore its relationship with burnout.
   Design: Cross-sectional 2007 and longitudinal 2006 to 2007 cohort study.
   Setting: 7 medical schools in the United States.
   Participants: 4287 medical students at 7 medical schools, with students
   at 5 institutions studied longitudinally.
   Measurements: Prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past year and its
   relationship to burnout, demographic characteristics, and quality of
   life.
   Results: Burnout was reported by 49.6\% (95\% CI, 47.5\% to 51.8\%) of
   students, and 11.2\% (CI, 9.9\% to 12.6\%) reported suicidal ideation
   within the past year. In a sensitivity analysis that assumed all
   nonresponders did not have suicidal ideation, the prevalence of suicidal
   ideation in the past 12 months would be 5.8\%. In the longitudinal
   cohort, burnout (P < 0.001 for all domains), quality of life (P < 0.002
   for each domain), and depressive symptoms (P < 0.001) at baseline
   predicted suicidal ideation over the following year. In multivariable
   analysis, burnout and low mental quality of life at baseline were
   independent predictors of suicidal ideation over the following year. Of
   the 370 students who met criteria for burnout in 2006, 99 (26.8\%)
   recovered. Recovery from burnout was associated with markedly less
   suicidal ideation, which suggests that recovery from burnout decreased
   suicide risk.
   Limitation: Although response rates (52\% for the cross-sectional study
   and 65\% for the longitudinal cohort study) are typical of physician
   surveys, nonresponse by some students reduces the precision of the
   estimated frequency of suicidal ideation and burnout.
   Conclusion: Approximately 50\% of students experience burnout and 10\%
   experience suicidal ideation during medical school. Burnout seems to be
   associated with increased likelihood of subsequent suicidal ideation,
   whereas recovery from burnout is associated with less suicidal ideation.}},

Abstract = {{In communicating with patients, especially patients receiving palliative
   care, empathy plays an important role. Little research has as yet been
   conducted into the development of the empathetic capacity of nursing
   students at various educational levels. An instrument that may be
   suitable for such research is the Staff-Patient Interaction Response
   Scale for Palliative Care Nursing (SPIRS-PCN). The purpose of the
   article is to determine the validity and reliability of the SPIRS-PCN,
   an instrument measuring empathy in palliative care. The
   criterion-related validity, homogeneity, and interrater reliability of
   the SPIRS-PCN were determined in nursing students (n = 357) who varied
   in gender, age, religious orientation, educational level, and experience
   in patient care. The validity of the SPIRS-PCN was underlined by
   identification of differences for religious orientation and the amount
   of experience. The variables gender, age, and educational level were not
   significant in relation to SPIRS-PCN scores. The homogeneity (Cronbach's
   alpha = .80) and interrater reliability (.74) of the instrument were
   adequate. We conclude that validity of the SPIRS-PCN was partially
   supported, whereas reliability was demonstrated. The instrument is
   feasible in educational situations; we recommend further research into
   the instrument's validity, especially in the progression of students'
   scores during the study program.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Caring is closely associated with reduced malpractice
   litigation, adherence to treatment and even symptom relief. Caring also
   is included in pay for performance formulas as well as widely utilized
   for quality improvement purposes. Our objective in this prospective
   qualitative study was to define caring behaviors associated with three
   challenging encounters: discussing the transition from curative to
   palliative care, delivering bad news (cancer), and discussing a medical
   error (misplaced test result). The purpose was to lay the groundwork for
   the creation of a `patient-centered' caring attitude checklist that
   could help the healthcare provider understand and ultimately enhance the
   patient's experience of care.
   Methods: Groups of randomly selected lay people, henceforth referred to
   as patients: (1) engaged in `think aloud' exercises to help create a
   15-item caring behavior checklist; (2) used the checklist to rate
   videotapes of simulated challenging encounters conducted by twenty
   primary care physicians (total of 600 ratings sets); and (3)
   participated in 12 separate 1.5 h focus groups discussing the caring
   (and non-caring) behaviors exhibited in videotapes of the highest and
   lowest rated encounters.
   Results: Thirteen behaviors emerged as focal for describing a doctor's
   caring attitude but with disagreement as to whether specific examples of
   these behaviors were `caring' or `uncaring.' For example, although the
   concept of empathic inquiry was considered important by most patients,
   the physician question, ``Is there someone you can call or talk with{''}
   (about a cancer diagnosis) was interpreted by one patient as `very
   caring' while-another was `impressed with how uncaring' the statement
   appeared.
   Conclusion: At the conceptual level there is a set of behaviors that
   represent caring, however, the manifestation of these behaviors is `in
   the eye of the beholder! The most important element of caring may not be
   the set of behaviors but a set of underlying abilities that include
   taking the patient's perspective and reflecting on the patient's
   responses.
   Practice implications: Medical education must focus on the underlying
   abilities of caring. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   evidence from the medical literature to inform curriculum content for
   workshops conducted with Internal Medicine and Family Medicine residents
   at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
   Results: Patient perspectives on caring gathered through focus groups
   differed in significant ways from the existing medical literature on
   caring when providers are communicating in the challenging situations
   that were depicted. Our data pointed out that individual reactions were
   unique and sometimes contradictory in that one person saw behavior as
   caring that others thought was uncaring. Participants often used
   qualifiers in their comments like ``appropriate{''} amounts of
   information, ``measured{''} empathy, chooses words carefully to reflect
   the relative nature of caring. ``Arranges to meet healthcare needs,{''}
   an issue that extends beyond the encounter, was seen as a new component
   of caring not previously described. Applying these concepts to
   curriculum required that we not only focus on the behavioral skills
   involved in these tasks, but also the processes of assessing patient's
   informational and emotional needs, and then taking steps to meet them,
   while adjusting behavior in real time to meet patients needs for caring.
   Workshops delivered were highly evaluated by residents.
   Conclusion: Patient perspectives on caring when providers deliver bad
   news, discuss transitions to palliative care, and communicate about a
   medical error reinforce that patient expectations for caring are highly
   contextualized and physician behavior needs to be individualized. We
   taught residents not only behavioral skills, but also the process skills
   of anticipating patient reactions, recognizing patient clues, planning
   and choosing effective strategies on the fly, and assessing one's own
   performance characteristic of communication expertise. Practice
   implications: Teaching caring attitudes with challenging communication
   tasks requires that learners appreciate and value not only caring
   behaviors but also learn the process by which they must adjust and
   titrate their actions to meet patient needs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{As the ``passion that animates authentic Professionalism,{''} humanism
   must be infused into medical education and clinical care as a central
   feature of medicine's Professionalism movement. In this article, we
   discuss a Current definition of humanism in medicine. We will also
   Provide detailed descriptions of educational programs intended to
   promote humanism at a number of medical schools in the United States
   (and beyond) and identify the key factors that make these programs
   effective. Common elements of programs that effectively teach humanism
   include: (1) opportunities for students to gain perspective in the lives
   of patients: (2) structured time for reflection on those experiences;
   and (3) focused mentoring to ensure that these experiences that both
   promote and sustain humanism in doctors, we hope to stimulate the
   thinking of other medical educators and to disseminate the impact of
   these innovative educational programs to help the profession meet its
   obligation to provide the public with humanistic physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Background. There has been little research into poetry-based medical
   education. Few studies consider learners' perceptions in depth.
   Objective. To explore general practice registrars' (GPRs) perceptions of
   two poetry-based sessions.
   Methods. GPRs in one general practice vocational training scheme
   experienced two poetry sessions. In one, the facilitator selected poems;
   in the other, poems were chosen by registrars. Poems were read and
   discussed, with emphasis on personal response. Data were obtained
   through in-depth semi-structured interviews with six registrars.
   Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using
   interpretative phenomenological analysis. Identification of individual
   ideas and shared themes enabled exploration of the registrars'
   experiences.
   Results. Registrars described how poetry helped them explore emotional
   territory. They recognized a broadening of education, describing how
   poems helped them consider different points of view, increasing their
   understanding of others. Vicarious experience, development of empathy
   and self-discovery were also reported. Participants speculated on how
   this might impact on patient care and professional practice.
   Facilitator-selected poems provided variety and ambiguity, provoking
   discussions with clinical relevance. Learner-selected poems enabled
   involvement, self-revelation and understanding of peers and developed
   emotional expression.
   Conclusions. These registrars reported difficulties expressing feelings
   in the culture of science-based medical training. Poetry sessions may
   provide an environment for emotional exploration, which could broaden
   understanding of self and others. Poetry-based education may develop
   emotional competence. The participants recognized development of key
   skills including close reading, attentive listening and interpretation
   of meaning. These skills may help doctors to understand individual
   patient's unique experience of illness, encouraging personalized care
   that respects patients' perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined pain and distress from needles in children
   undergoing blood sampling as a function of adult-child interaction and

   ports, or peripheral access via venipuncture). Participants were 55
   pediatric oncology patients, aged 3-18years, who were undergoing routine
   blood work. Pain ratings were obtained using the Faces Pain
   Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and conversation during the procedure was audio
   taped for coding using the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction
   Scale-Revised (CAMPIS-R). Childrens ratings of pain using the FPS-R were
   similar in the port (M = 2.57/10, standard deviation {[}SD] = 3.46) and
   peripheral (M = 2.56/10, SD = 3.24) groups, despite the fact that most
   children with internal ports were given a topical anesthetic. Similarly,
   there were no differences between port and peripheral groups in rates of
   child coping or distress, or parent and nurse observations of child
   pain. As would be expected, external line access was not associated with
   pain or distress, even among very young children, suggesting that they
   appropriately understood the pain rating scale. Results of the
   transcribed CAMPIS-R data indicate that the influences in adult-child

   well-established positive relationship between child. distress and adult
   reassurance and empathy. Implications for intervention and selection of

Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{806-812}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient-centered communication (PCC) is associated with more
   appropriate treatment of depression in primary care. Aside from patient
   presentation, little is known about other influences on PCC. We
   investigated whether PCC is influenced by personality dispositions of
   primary care providers, independent of patient presentation.
   Methods: Forty-six primary care providers completed personality scales
   from the NEO-Personality Inventory, revised and provided care to 88
   standardized patients presenting with either major depression or
   adjustment disorder with comorbid musculoskeletal symptoms, either
   making or not making a medication request. Coders scored each visit
   using the measure of PCC, assessing physicians' ability to explore the
   patient's illness experience (component 1), understand the patient's
   psychosocial context (component 2), and involve the patient in
   collaborative discussions of treatment (component 3).
   Results: Adjusting for physician demographics, training, and patient
   presentation, physicians who were more open to feelings explored the
   patient's experience of illness more (P = 0.05). More dutiful, or
   rule-bound physicians engaged in greater exploration of the patient's
   psychosocial and life circumstances (P = 0.04), but involved the patient
   less in treatment discussions (P = 0.03). Physicians reporting more
   anxious vulnerability also involved the patient less (P = 0.03).
   Physician demographics, training, and patient presentation explained
   4-7\% of variance in the measure of patient-centered communication
   components, with personality explaining an additional 4-7\% of the
   variance.
   Conclusions: Understanding of personality dispositions that promote or
   detract from PCC may help medical educators better identify trainees of
   varying aptitude, facilitate medical career counseling, and address
   individual training needs in a tailored fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Previous studies about resident well-being have focused on
   negative aspects of well-being. We conducted this study to explore
   residents' conceptions of well-being and how it affects their work.
   Methods: One investigator conducted semi-structured interviews with
   residents at two hospitals during February-June 2005. Through random
   sampling stratified by program and gender, we invited 49 residents from
   internal medicine, psychiatry, surgery, emergency medicine, anesthesia,
   obstetrics/gynecology, and pediatrics. Using an editing analysis style,
   three investigators independently coded transcripts.
   Results: 26 residents participated in 45-min interviews. Residents
   acknowledged that well-being affected four elements of their work:
   relationships with patients, interactions with colleagues, performance,
   and motivation. Residents described higher quality discussions with
   patients when their well-being was high and inappropriate exchanges when
   well-being was low. Residents attributed conflict with colleagues to C,
   9 lower states of well-being. Residents felt they had improved
   decision-making when their well-being was higher. Residents' motivation
   in their daily work and career varied with fluctuating well-being. Five
   residents initially denied that their well-being affects their work,
   voicing concerns that this would be unprofessional.
   Conclusions: Most residents felt that both high and low levels of
   well-being affected their work, particularly their work relationships.
   Practice implications: The educational and patient care goals of
   residency training may be enhanced through interventions that promote
   resident well-being. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Communication is a key competence for medical and nursing health care
   providers alike. However, there appear to be areas of
   ``speechlessness{''} regarding specific medical problems, including the
   ``taboo{''} disease incontinence. There is a lack of scientific data
   regarding incontinence in the context of communication among patients
   and health care professionals.
   The descriptive study was designed to provide insights how female and
   male patients alike perceive communications about incontinence with
   doctors and nurses, respectively. 22 structured interviews were
   conducted and taped with 16 elderly female and 6 male patients (age >=
   60 years, mean: 81 years, demented patients excluded, n = 19
   analysable), and five interviews each with doctors and nurses within the
   setting of a rehabilitation hospital for geriatric patients (not
   reported here). We used published methodology to interpret the diversity
   of patients' verbal communications to the female interviewer.
   Results suggest that patients wish to find a relationship based on
   sympathy, empathy and trust. If incontinence is addressed, it is by
   doctors, not patients. Statements by patients suggest that they
   differentiate between expectations addressing the professional level of
   medical care, and a level perhaps best described as the quality of the
   personal relationship between the patient and doctor. However, these
   twofold expectations were not distinguishable regarding nursing
   professionals, they were perceived on a ``personal care level{''} only,
   not the professional level regarding incontinence. Independent of
   professional affiliation, patients expect empathy, understanding, and
   respect. They selectively criticize manners of (some) nurses and lack of
   understandable transfer of information by doctors. The gender of the
   care providers was not an issue for patients regarding communication
   about incontinence. The preliminary results show that there is room for
   improvement for better communication regarding incontinence. However,
   areas affected appear to differ between nursing and medical
   professionals.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently little knowledge or understanding of medical
   students' knowledge and attitudes toward the poor. Teaching hospitals
   bring students face-to-face with poor and uninsured patients on a
   regular basis. However, an overview of the research available suggests
   that this contact does not result in students' greater understanding and
   empathy for the plight of the poor and may, in fact, lead to an erosion
   of positive attitudes toward the poor. A basic understanding of justice
   suggests that as the poor are disproportionately the subjects of medical
   training, this population should enjoy a proportionate benefit for this
   service. Furthermore, medicine's social contract with the public is
   often thought to include an ideal of service to the underserved and a
   duty to help educate the general public regarding the health needs of
   our nation.
   In their discussion, the authors situate medical students' attitudes
   toward the poor within larger cultural perspectives, including attitudes
   toward the poor and attributions for poverty. They provide three
   suggestions for improving trainees' knowledge of and attitudes toward
   the poor-namely, increasing the socioeconomic diversity of students,
   promoting empathy through curricular efforts, and focusing more directly
   on role modeling. The authors argue that service learning, especially
   efforts that include gaining detailed knowledge of a particular person
   or persons, coupled with critical reflection, presents a very promising
   direction toward achieving these goals. Finally, they posit an agenda
   for future educational research that might contribute to the increased
   efficacy of medical education in this important formative domain.}},

Title = {{A Conceptual Framework for the Use of Illness Narratives in Medical
   Education}},

Abstract = {{The use of narratives, including physicians' and patients' stories,
   literature, and film, is increasingly popular in medical education.
   There is, however, a need for an overarching conceptual framework to
   guide these efforts, which are often dismissed as ``soft{''} and placed
   at the margins of medical school curricula. The purpose of this article
   is to describe the conceptual basis for an approach to patient-centered
   medical education and narrative medicine initiated at the University of
   Micnigan Medical School in the fall of 2003. This approach, the Family
   Centered Experience, involves home visits and conversations between
   beginning medical students and patient volunteers and their families and
   is aimed at fostering humanism in medicine. The program incorporates
   developmental and learning theory, longitudinal interactions with
   individuals with chronic illness, reflective learning, and small-group
   discussions to explore the experience of illness and its care. The
   author describes a grounding of this approach in theories of empathy and
   moral development and clarifies the educational value that narratives
   bring to medical education. Specific pedagogical considerations,
   including use of activities to create ``cognitive disequilibrium{''} and
   the concept of transformative learning, are also discussed and may be
   applied to narrative medicine, professionalism, multicultural education,
   medical ethics, and other subject areas in medical education that
   address individuals and their health care needs in society.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Medical educators act on the belief that students benefit
   from formal and informal educational experiences that foster virtues
   such as compassion, altruism, and respect for patients.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine fourth year medical
   students' perspectives on how, where, and by whom they believe the
   virtues associated with good physicianhood have been taught to them.
   DESIGN: Fourth year students were assigned a two- to three-page essay
   that asked them to reflect on how their medical education had ``fostered
   and hindered{''} their conceptions of compassion, altruism, and respect
   for patients.
   PARTICIPANTS: All 112 students completed this assignment, and 52 (46\%)
   gave us permission to use their essays for this study.
   APPROACH: An inductive, qualitative approach was used to develop themes
   derived from students' essays.
   RESULTS: Students' thoughts were organized around the idea of influences
   in three areas to which they consistently referred. Foundational
   influences included parents and ``formative years,{''} religious faith,
   and other experiences preceding medical school. Preclinical education
   influences comprised formal classroom experiences (both positive and
   negative effects). Clinical education influences included role modeling
   (both positive and negative) and the clinical environment (notable for
   emphasis on efficiency and conflicting cues). Students' essays drew most
   heavily on the effects of role modeling.
   DISCUSSION: Medical students arrive at our doors as thoughtful,
   compassionate people. Positive role models and activities to promote
   critical self-reflection may help nurture these attitudes.}},

Title = {{Medical students' experiences with medical errors: an analysis of
   medical student essays}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{733-741}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine medical students' experiences with
   medical errors.
   METHODS In 2001 and 2002, 172 fourth-year medical students wrote an
   anonymous description of a significant medical error they had witnessed
   or committed during their clinical clerkships. The assignment
   represented part of a required medical ethics course. We analysed 147 of
   these essays using thematic content analysis.
   RESULTS Many medical students made or observed significant errors. In
   either situation, some students experienced distress that seemingly went
   unaddressed. Furthermore, this distress was sometimes severe and
   persisted after the initial event. Some students also experienced
   considerable uncertainty as to whether an error had occurred and how to
   prevent future errors. Many errors may not have been disclosed to
   patients, and some students who desired to discuss or disclose errors
   were apparently discouraged from doing so by senior doctors. Some
   students criticised senior doctors who attempted to hide errors or avoid
   responsibility. By contrast, students who witnessed senior doctors take
   responsibility for errors and candidly disclose errors to patients
   appeared to recognise the importance of honesty and integrity and said
   they aspired to these standards.
   CONCLUSIONS There are many missed opportunities to teach students how to
   respond to and learn from errors. Some faculty members and housestaff
   may at times respond to errors in ways that appear to contradict
   professional standards. Medical educators should increase exposure to
   exemplary responses to errors and help students to learn from and cope
   with errors.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this systematic review was to examine studies that have
   investigated sustaining hope during prognostic and end-of-life issues
   discussions with terminally ill patients and their families. A
   comprehensive search of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and handsearching, from
   1985 to June 2006, identified 27 studies.
   This review suggests that the issues surrounding hope in this context
   are complex. Despite the lack of unanimity among researchers regarding
   the definition of hope, findings suggest that balancing hope with
   honesty is an important skill for health professionals (HPs). Many
   patients seem to be able to maintain a sense of hope despite
   acknowledging the terminal nature of their illness. Patients and
   caregivers mostly preferred honest and accurate information, provided
   with empathy and understanding. Many different sources of hope were
   identified in this context in broad aspects of life, not just the
   medical situation. HPs need to recognize this spectrum of hope and
   appreciate that patients may simultaneously hope for `cure' while
   acknowledging the terminal nature of their illness. HPs may help
   patients to cope with their terminal prognosis by xploring and fostering
   realistic forms of hope that are meaningful for the particular patient
   and their family. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{279-284}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ability to recognize and adapt to affective states in
   one's self and others, emotional intelligence is thought to connote
   effective, compassionate doctor-patient communication. Unfortunately,
   medical training has been shown to erode some of the very attributes it
   purports to instill in students. Purpose: The objective is to examine
   changes in students' emotional intelligence and empathy across an
   undergraduate medical curriculum. Methods: During M1 orientation and
   again following M3 clerkship training, students in the University of
   Kentucky College of Medicine Class of 2004 completed the Trait Meta-Mood
   Scale (TMMS) and Davis' Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Baseline
   changes in specific dimensions were examined for both male and female
   students. Results: Reliability of subscales was generally acceptable
   (alpha >= .70). Sixty-four students provided data at both time points.
   Compared to baseline, two of three TMMS dimensions-attention to feelings
   and mood repair-were significantly (p <= .05) lower at follow-up. One
   IRI dimension-empathic concern-was also significantly lower at Time 2,
   whereas another, Personal Distress, was significantly higher. However,
   differences generally reflected only small effect sizes. No significant
   gender interactions were noted. Conclusions: Despite quite modest effect
   sizes, findings suggest that students' abilities to effectively manage
   affective states may be subject to some minor fluctuation across the
   undergraduate educational continuum. However, whether these observed
   declines constitute meaningful, clinically relevant changes remains
   unclear.}},

Title = {{The role of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in Germany - A
   focus group study of GPs}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: There has been a marked increase in the use of complementary
   and alternative medicine (CAM) in recent years worldwide. In Germany,
   apart from `Heilpraktiker' (= state-licensed, non-medical CAM
   practitioners), some general practitioners (GPs) provide CAM in their
   practices. This paper aims to explore the attitudes of GPs about the
   role of CAM in Germany, in relation to the healthcare system, quality of
   care, medical education and research. Furthermore, experiences of GPs
   integrating CAM in their daily practice were explored.
   Methods: Using a qualitative methodological approach 3 focus groups with
   a convenience sample of 17 GPs were conducted. The discussions were
   transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: The majority of the participating GPs had integrated one or
   more CAM therapies into their every-day practice. Four key themes were
   identified based on the topics covered in the focus groups: the role of
   CAM within the German healthcare system, quality of care, education and
   research. Within the theme `role of CAM within the healthcare system'
   there were five categories: integration of CAM, CAM in the Statutory
   Health Insurance, modernisation of the Statutory Health Insurance Act,
   individual healthcare services and `Heilpraktiker'. Regarding quality of
   care there were two broad groups of GPs: those who thought patients
   would benefit from standardizing CAM and those who feared that quality
   control would interfere with the individual approach of CAM. The main
   issues identified relating to research and education were the need for
   the development of alternative research strategies and the low quality
   of existing CAM education respectively.
   Conclusion: The majority of the participating GPs considered CAM as a
   reasonable complementary approach within primary care. The study
   increased our understanding of GPs attitudes about the role of CAM
   within the German healthcare system and the use of `Heilpraktiker' as a
   competing CAM-provider. It seems to be a need for increased funding for
   research, better education and remuneration by the Statutory Health
   Insurance in order to improve access to `Integrative medicine' in
   Germany.}},

Journal = {{FAMILY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{407-411}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: BATHE is an acronym for Background, Affect, Trouble,
   Handling, and Empathy and refers to specific questions or comments
   incorporated into a standard medical interview. The BATHE technique was
   developed as a rapid psychosocial intervention for the assessment of
   psychological factors that may contribute to patients' physical
   complaints. The present research was designed to determine whether the
   use of BATHE significantly increased patient satisfaction during a visit
   to a family physician. Methods: Four family physicians in a busy urban
   family practice center were involved in the study. Two physicians were
   instructed to use the BATHE protocols until data had been collected from
   10 patients and then to proceed in their usual fashion with their next
   10 patients. The other two physicians conducted their interview as usual
   with their first 10 patients and then used BATHE with the following 10
   patients. All patients were asked to complete a satisfaction survey
   following their consultation. Results: BATHEd patients responded with
   significantly higher ratings for 8 of the 11 satisfaction measures,
   including those related to information provided, perception of physician
   concern, and likelihood of recommending the physician to others.
   Conclusions: The results of this pilot study support the use of BATHE
   with primary care patients, as it increases patient satisfaction,
   possibly by helping patients sense that their physician is sympathetic
   and concerned.}},

   Hg), vasovagal episodes, cardiac events, and respiratory impairment.
   RESULTS: Patients treated with hypnosis experienced significantly less
   pain and anxiety than those in the standard care and empathy groups at
   several time intervals and received significantly fewer median drug
   units (mean, 2.0; interquartile range {[}IQR], 1-4) than patients in the
   standard (mean, 3.0; IQR, 1.5-5.0; P = .0147) and empathy groups (mean,
   3.50, IQR, 2.0-5.9; P =.0026). Thirty-one of 65 patients (48\%) in the
   empathy group had adverse events, which was significantly more than in
   the hypnosis group (eight of 66; 12\%; P = .0001) and standard care
   group (18 of 70; 26\%; P = .0118).
   CONCLUSIONS: Procedural hypnosis including empathic attention reduces
   pain, anxiety, and medication use. Conversely, empathic approaches
   without hypnosis that provide an external focus of attention and do not
   enhance patients' self-coping can result in more adverse events. These
   findings should have major implications in the education of procedural
   personnel.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To promote monthly interpersonal skill communication
   role-play and coaching for front-office staff.
   Method: For 15 min a month, during staff meetings, healthcare staff such
   as receptionists and medical assistants should participate in
   communication skill coaching. Participants should discuss a recurring
   communication challenge (e.g., patients irritated by repeated requests
   for health histories), role-play options for communication, and receive
   feedback.
   Result: Interpersonal communication skills such as acknowledging the
   concerns of others are acquired slowly. Repeated practice and supportive
   feedback increase the likelihood that these skills will be valued and
   mastered.
   Conclusion: Research shows communication skills develop when they are
   modeled and role-played frequently and are less likely to develop with
   occasional interventions.
   Practice implication: Health care professionals should devote time to
   role-playing interaction with patients for brief intervals at least
   monthly. Staff should give one another feedback on the best options for
   managing challenging communication situations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland

   the vices and virtues of these simulations in measuring clinical and

   simulations, the scores and feedback comments from standardized patients
   to learners regarding their empathic behaviors can identify learners
   with important deficiencies. We conclude our discussion by recommending
   that reflective practice, challenging cases, decision moments, and
   raters training to provide feedback can supplement and enrich the use of
   standardized patient simulations in evaluating empathy. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{There has been a call to include empathy as a selection criterion in
   medical training.
   Empathy is a complex construct currently assessed by self-rating and
   observational scales, which may be complicated by the subjectivity of
   such measurements.
   Neuroscientific research into disorders of empathy such as autism should
   be encouraged to help further refine the evolving construct of empathy.
   Empathy may be more common in females, and selection for higher empathy
   may discriminate against males unless sex-specific adjustments are
   included in selection criteria.
   Physician empathy may lead to greater patient satisfaction and
   confidence in physicians, but more evidence is needed to support links
   to physician competence. In contrast, academic performance and
   conscientiousness have been clearly linked to physician competence.
   Competence and empathy may be independent qualities developed by
   different aspects of medical training.
   Provision of better work conditions and environments for physicians may
   forestall erosion of empathy, reducing the need to predict and enhance
   its development.
   Empathy should be valued in medical students and doctors, but more
   research is needed into the nature, assessment, and correlates of
   empathy before its adoption as a selection criterion for medical

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT Previous studies have suggested that the patient's experience of
   a consultation with a doctor is not affected by the presence of medical
   students. However, no study has looked at the effect of student presence
   on conventional UK general practice consultations.
   OBJECTIVES This study aimed to measure the quality of the consultation
   as experienced by patients when students are present, to explore
   patients' attitudes to the presence of medical students, and to look at
   the relationships between these factors.
   METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire study in general
   practices in north-east England. General practitioners (GPs) from
   practices teaching fourth and final year students administered
   questionnaires to patients who were seen in either teaching or
   non-teaching consultations. The questionnaire comprised previously
   validated measures of empathy and enablement as measures of quality,
   attitudinal statements regarding the presence of students, a scale
   rating pertaining to the patient's degree of acquaintance with the
   doctor, and items on demographic data.
   RESULTS Results showed no significant differences in enablement scores
   between the 2 groups. Consultations with student presence last longer.
   Empathy scores were significantly lower in the `student present' group,
   but the size of the difference was small. Attitudinal statements
   regarding the presence of students showed a high proportion of positive
   responses, and some groupings of negative ones. Further analysis
   demonstrated some significant links between attitudinal statements and
   enablement and empathy scores.
   CONCLUSIONS The quality of general practice consultations was not
   adversely affected by medical student presence. However, significant
   numbers of patients who agreed to be seen with a student present were
   resistant to the student's presence.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine factors affecting the length of hospital stay
   (LOS) of patients referred to psychiatric consultation liaison (C-L)
   services.
   Methods: The study sample prospectively included all the referrals in
   2004 to the C-L psychiatry unit at King Khaled University Hospital in
   Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The following factors were documented
   for each consultation: patient demographic characteristics, dates of
   admission, consultation, and discharge, and total days of stay, medical
   specialty service requesting the consultation, reason for referral given
   by the referring physician, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders DSM-IV diagnosis, based on the consultation interview.
   Results: The total number of referrals was 264. The LOS showed positive
   correlation with referral time (p=0.0001) accounting for 22\% of the
   variance in LOS. Surgical ward admission and diagnosis of delirium
   predicted longer LOS, while obstetric/gynecology ward admission,
   diagnosis of anxiety, and diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder
   predicted shorter LOS.
   Conclusion: The direct correlation between the timing of referral and
   LOS reinforces that it is important for medical professionals to
   identify and detect patients who require early psychiatric intervention.
   Ways of detecting high-risk patients are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hip and tech-savvy medical students and junior doctors are
   likely to find lecture-based professionalism and ethics modules boring.
   Medical-based television dramas and films, on the other hand, are
   exciting and topical, and often feature real-life situations, albeit
   presented with artistic license. Current ``hot{''} television series,
   such as House, ER, and Grey's Anatomy, feature scenarios which are
   thought-provoking, not only for the fascinating cases featured, but also
   for the ethical dilemmas and professionalism issues which present
   themselves. Summary: We discuss the educational merits of the genre of
   the medical drama and propose to develop an ``In-House{''} Medical
   Education Initiative, in which an episode of House is shown, and
   participants encouraged, at the end of the screening, to discuss the
   following: ethics, professionalism (communications skills,
   confidentiality, sensitivity, and empathy), history taking and clinical
   examination, diagnostic steps and missteps, and finally learning points
   (or take-home messages). Conclusion: Television programs, purported to
   ``rot the mind,{''} can actually be put to good use in the teaching of
   ``soft skills{''} in medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To determine whether vicarious empathy (i.e., to have a visceral
   empathic response, versus role-playing empathy) decreases, and whether
   students choosing specialties with greater patient contact maintain
   vicarious empathy better than do students choosing specialties with less
   patient contact.
   Method
   The Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale was administered at the beginning
   of each academic year at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
   for four classes, 2001-2004. Students also reported their gender and
   specialty choice. Specialty choice was classified as core (internal
   medicine, family medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, and
   psychiatry) or noncore (all other specialties).
   Results
   Vicarious empathy significantly decreased during medical education (P
   <.001), especially after the first and third years. Students choosing
   core careers had higher empathy than did those choosing noncore careers.
   Men choosing core careers initially had empathy exceeding population
   norms, but their empathy fell to be comparable with that of norms by the
   end of their third year. The empathy of men choosing noncore careers was
   comparable with that of norms, Women choosing core careers had empathy
   scores comparable with those of norms, but the scores of women choosing
   noncore careers fell below those of the norms by their second year.
   Conclusions
   The findings suggest that undergraduate medical education may be a major
   determinant differentially affecting the vicarious empathy of students
   on the basis of gender and/or specialty choice. The greatest impact
   occurred in men who chose noncore specialties. The significant decrease
   in vicarious empathy is of concern, because empathy is crucial for a
   successful physician-patient relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Medical students must be prepared for working in inter-professional and
   multi-disciplinary clinical teams centred on a patient's care pathway.
   While there has been a good deal of rhetoric surrounding patient-centred
   medical education, there has been little attempt to conceptualise such a
   practice beyond the level of describing education of communication
   skills and empathy within a broad `professionalism' framework.
   Paradoxically, while aiming to strengthen patient-student interactions,
   this approach tends to refocus on the role modelling of the physician,
   and opportunities for potentially deep collaborative working
   relationships between students and patients are missed. A radical
   overhaul of conventional doctor-led medical education may be necessary,
   that also challenges the orthodoxies of individualistic student-centred
   approaches, leading to an authentic patient-centred model that shifts
   the locus of learning from the relationship between doctor as educator
   and student to the relationship between patient and student, with expert
   doctor as resource. Drawing on contemporary poststructuralist theory of
   text and identity construction, and on innovative models of work-based
   learning, the potential quality of relationship between student and
   patient is articulated in terms of collaborative knowledge production,
   involving close reading with the patient as text, through dialogue.
   Here, a medical `education' displaces traditional forms of medical
   `training' that typically involve individual information reproduction.
   Students may, paradoxically, improve clinical acumen through
   consideration of silences, gaps, and contradictions in patients as
   texts, rather than treating communication as transparent. Such
   paradoxical effects have been systematically occluded or denied in
   traditional medical education.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the prevalence of depression and burnout among

   these disorders and medication errors.
   Design Prospective cohort study.
   Setting Three urban freestanding children's hospitals in the United
   States.
   Participants 123 residents in three paediatric residency programmes.
   Main outcome measures Prevalence of depression using the Harvard
   national depression screening day scale, burnout using the Maslach
   burnout inventory, and rate of medication errors per resident month.
   Results 24 (20\%) of the participating residents met the criteria for
   depression and 92 (74\%) met the criteria for burnout. Active
   surveillance yielded 45 errors made by participants. Depressed residents
   made 6.2 times as many medication errors per resident month as residents
   who were not depressed: 1.55 (95\% confidence interval 0.57 to 4.22)
   compared with 0.25 (0.14 to 0.46, P<0.001). Burnt out residents and
   non-burnt out residents made similar rates of errors per resident month:
   0.45 (0.20 to 0.98) compared with 0.53 (0.21 to 1.33, P=0.2).
   Conclusions Depression and burnout are major problems among residents in
   paediatrics. Depressed residents made significantly more medical errors
   than their non-depressed peers; however, burnout did not seem to
   correlate with an increased rate of medical errors.}},

Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed to explore what women valued most in disclosing
   partner abuse to their doctor and whether disclosure played a role in
   handling their abuse situation.
   Methods: A qualitative method was used to understand abused women's
   views and experiences with disclosure to their family doctor. Thirty-six
   women were interviewed within 4 weeks after disclosure to their family
   doctor.
   Results: Most women went to see the doctor for some medical complaint,
   and only three women planned to disclose the abuse. Twenty-five women
   valued most their doctor's communicative approach with empathy or
   empowering and nine women valued most the instrumental approach. Eight
   women of the latter group wanted this combined with a communicative
   approach. After disclosure to the family doctor, a group of women (n =
   20) perceived a real change in their possibilities to handle their
   situation. They appeared to be in a position we named: `in transition',
   a state in which they started or continued a process of change. Another
   group of women (n = 13) appeared to be in a `locked-up' position, a
   state without any prospect on change, feeling out of control and fearing
   the abuser. Three women reacted reserved towards change.
   Conclusion: A communicative approach, providing empathy and empowerment,
   is important to women in disclosing partner abuse. More than half of the
   women perceived possibilities for a change.
   Practice implications: Talking about abuse is an important step in a
   woman's process of change. Doctors should acknowledge the advantage of
   their position as a professional confidant and ask women about abuse.
