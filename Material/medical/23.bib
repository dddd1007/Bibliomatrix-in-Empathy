Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to examine how emotional cues/concerns are
   expressed and responded to in medical consultations with adolescent and
   young adults (AYA), an understudied patient group, at the time of cancer
   diagnosis.
   Methods: Nine consultations in which AYA patients aged 12-25 years were
   informed about their cancer diagnosis and treatment plans were audio
   recorded. Expressions of emotional cues/concerns and physicians'
   responses were identified and coded using The Verona Coding Definitions
   of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES).
   Results: A total of 135 emotional cues/concerns (range: 2-26, median:
   13) were identified. Cues or concerns that were expressed by patients
   and relatives following questions from physicians were more often
   explicit than patient-initiated cues/concerns. Questions about medical
   and practical issues could often be understood as ways of expressing
   emotional cues. When patients or relatives expressed less explicit
   verbal cues about underlying concerns, physicians often responded by
   presenting medical information without commenting on the emotional
   aspect indicated by the cue.
   Conclusion: The communication was dominated by information-giving, but
   the questions from patients and relatives and their responses to the
   information often had emotional connotations.
   Practice implications: Patients' requests for information may include an
   emotional aspect. These preliminary findings should be tested in a
   larger sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Silences in doctor-patient communication can be
   ``connectional{''} and communicative, in contrast to silences that
   indicate awkwardness or distraction. Musical and lexical analyses can
   identify and characterize connectional silences in consultations between
   oncologists and patients.
   Methods: Two medical students and a professor of voice screened all 1211
   silences over 2 s in length from 124 oncology office visits. We
   developed a ``strength of connection{''} taxonomy and examined ten
   connectional silences for lexical and musical features including pitch,
   volume, and speaker turn-taking rhythm.
   Results: We identified connectional silences with good reliability.
   Typical dialog rhythms surrounding connectional silences are
   characterized by relatively equal turn lengths and frequent short
   vocalizations. We found no pattern of volume and pitch variability
   around these silences. Connectional silences occurred in a wide variety
   of lexical contexts.
   Conclusion: Particular patterns of dialog rhythm mark connectional
   silences. Exploring structures of connectional silence extends our
   understanding of the audio-linguistic conditions that mark
   patient-clinician connection.
   Practice implications: Communicating with an awareness of pitch, rhythm,
   and silence - in addition to lexical content - can facilitate shared
   understanding and emotional connection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   41) and were pre-tested before education with METT and SETT at baseline.
   Then, training students took second tests after a 1-h class about
   interpreting micro and subtle expressions and control students took the
   second tests without the class.
   Results: METT pre-test scores were positively related with female

   This study explored how physicians' regulation of displayed emotions
   affects patients' satisfaction, under low and high levels of patient

   clinics of two hospitals.
   Results: Data were analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling which
   takes the nested data structure into account. We found a significant

   patient distress on satisfaction: When distress was high, physician
   regulation of emotions was negatively related to patient satisfaction.
   The results also show a significant interaction effect of physician
   regulation of displayed emotions and length of physician-patient
   acquaintance: With a longer acquaintance, physician regulation of
   emotions was negatively related to patient satisfaction.

Title = {{Schwartz Centre Rounds: a new initiative in the undergraduate
   curriculum-what do medical students think?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Training to be a doctor and caring for patients are
   recognized as being stressful and demanding. The wellbeing of healthcare
   professionals impacts upon the wellbeing and care of patients. Schwartz
   Centre Rounds (SCRs), multidisciplinary meetings led by a trained
   facilitator and designed for hospital staff, were introduced to enhance
   communication and compassion, and have since been widely adopted as a
   way of fostering compassion. The continuum of education suggests that
   medical students need to develop these attributes in conjunction with
   resilience and maintaining empathy. The benefits of SCRs in fostering
   this development in medical students is unexplored. The objective of
   this study was to examine the potential of SCRs within the undergraduate
   curriculum.
   Methods: Two student-focused SCRs were piloted at a major medical
   school. The sessions were based on the current format implemented across
   the US and UK: a presentation of cases by a multidisciplinary panel
   followed by an open discussion with the audience. Participants were
   asked to complete an evaluative questionnaire immediately following the
   sessions. Seven students took part in a focus group to explore their
   views on the SCR. Data sets were examined using descriptive statistics
   and thematic analysis.
   Results: Feedback was obtained from 77 \% (258/334) Year 5 and 37 \%
   (126/343) Year 6 students. Mean student ratings of the session on a
   five-point scale, where 1 = poor and 5 = exceptional, were 3.5 (Year 5)
   and 3.3 (Year 6). Over 80 \% of respondents either agreed or strongly
   agreed that the presentation of cases was helpful and gave them insight
   into how others feel/think about caring for patients. Eighty percent
   said they would attend a future SCR and 64 \% believed SCRs should be
   integrated into the curriculum. Focus group participants felt SCRs
   promoted reflection and processing of emotion. Students identified
   smaller group sizes and timing in the curriculum as ways of improving
   SCRs.
   Conclusion: Students were positive about SCRs, preferring them to their
   current reflective practice assignments. Whether this results in
   sustained benefits to trainee doctors is yet to be explored.
   Consideration is given to overcoming the challenges that were
   encountered, such as optimal timing and participation. Staff training
   and costs are potential obstacles to adoption.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is a key aspect of the physician-patient
   interactions. The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) is one of the most
   used empathy measures of medical students. The development of
   cross-cultural empathy studies depends on valid and reliable
   translations of the JSE. This study sought to: (1) adapt and assess the
   psychometric properties in Spanish students of the Spanish JSE validated
   in Mexican students; (2) test a second order latent factor model.
   Methods: The Spanish JSE was adapted from the Spanish JSE-S, resulting
   in a final version of the measure. A non-probabilistic sample of 1104
   medical students of two Spanish medical schools completed a
   socio-demographic and the Spanish JSE-S. Descriptive statistics, along
   with a confirmatory factor analysis, the average variance extracted
   (AVE), Cronbach's alphas and composite reliability (CR) coefficients
   were computed. An independent samples t-test was performed to access sex
   differences.
   Results: The Spanish JSE-S demonstrated acceptable to good sensitivity
   (individual items - except for item 2 - and JSE-S total score: -2.72 <
   Sk < 0.35 and -0.77 < Ku < 7.85), convergent validity (AVE: between 0.28
   and 0.45) and reliability (Cronbach's alphas: between 0.62 and 0.78; CR:
   between 0.62 and 0.87). The confirmatory factor analysis supported the
   three-factor solution and the second order latent factor model.
   Conclusions: The findings provide support for the sensitivity, construct
   validity and reliability of the adapted Spanish JSE-S with Spanish
   medical students. Data confirm the hypothesized second order latent
   factor model. This version may be useful in future research examining
   empathy in Spanish medical students, as well as in cross-cultural

Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: To facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and to make
   connections between patients' diseases and their social/cultural
   contexts, the study examined whether the use of heterogeneous cluster
   grouping in reflective writing for medical humanities literature
   acquisition could have positive effects on medical university students
   in terms of empathy, critical thinking, and reflective writing.
   Methods: A 15-week quasi-experimental design was conducted to
   investigate the learning outcomes. After conducting cluster algorithms,
   heterogeneous learning clusters (experimental group; n = 43) and
   non-heterogeneous learning clusters (control group; n = 43) were derived
   for a medical humanities literature study. Before and after the
   intervention, an Empathy Scale in Patient Care (ES-PC), a critical
   thinking disposition assessment (CTDA-R), and a reflective writing test
   were administered to both groups.
   Results: The findings showed that on the empathy scale, significant
   differences in the ``behavioral empathy,{''} ``affective empathy,{''}
   and overall sections existed between the post-test mean scores of the
   experimental group and those of the control group, but such differences
   did not exist in ``intelligent empathy.{''}Regarding critical thinking,
   there were significant differences in ``systematicity and

   significant differences existed in ``ideas,{''} ``voice and point of
   view,{''} ``critical thinking and representation,{''} ``depth of
   reflection on personal growth,{''} and overall sections, but not in
   ``focus and context structure{''} and ``language and conventions.{''}

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The article reviews the most recent developments in integrating
   humanities into medical education. Global implications and future trends
   are illustrated.
   Recent findings
   The main concern of medical humanities education is teaching
   professionalism; one important aspect that has emerged is the goal of
   nurturing emotion through reflexivity. Relating effectively to all
   stakeholders and being sensitive to inequitable power dynamics are
   essential for professional social accountability in modern medical
   contexts. Mediating doctors' understanding of the clinical encounter
   through creative arts and narrative is part of most recent pedagogic
   innovations aimed at motivating learners to become empowered, engaged
   and caring clinicians. Scenario-based and discursive-oriented
   evaluations of such activities should be aligned with the medical
   humanities' problem-based learning curriculum. Medical humanities
   education fosters professional reflexivity that is important for
   achieving patient-centered care.
   Summary
   Countering insufficient empathy with reflective professionalism is an
   urgent challenge in medical education; to answer this need, creative
   arts and narrative understanding have emerged as crucial tools of
   medical humanities education. To ensure competent professional identity
   formation in the era of translational medicine, medical humanities
   programs have adopted scenario-based assessments through inclusion of
   different voices and emphasizing personal reflection and social
   critique.}},

Title = {{Identification of factors influencing patient satisfaction with
   orthopaedic outpatient clinic consultation: A qualitative study}},
Journal = {{MANUAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{48-55}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, new models of health service delivery in
   orthopaedic outpatient clinics, including physiotherapists working in
   orthopaedic triage roles, have become increasingly common. Evaluation of
   patient satisfaction with orthopaedic clinic services is dependent on an
   understanding of factors influencing patient satisfaction in this
   clinical context.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the factors
   influencing patient satisfaction with orthopaedic outpatient clinic
   services.
   Study Design: A cross-sectional, qualitative design including focus
   groups and interviews.
   Methods: Interviews and focus group sessions were undertaken with 36
   participants representing patients, health professionals and clinical
   support staff in an orthopaedic outpatient clinic. Interviews and focus
   groups provided a rich narrative which was subjected to a process of
   thematic analysis.
   Results: The analysis identified seven themes influencing patient
   satisfaction with orthopaedic clinic assessment. These themes were
   clinic waiting time, clinical contact time, trust, empathy,
   communication, expectation and relatedness.
   Conclusions: Understanding factors influencing patient satisfaction is
   important to inform organisational and clinical processes that aim to
   foster high levels of patient satisfaction. Clinician awareness of the
   interpersonal issues which dominate stakeholders' perspectives of
   patient satisfaction may improve the patient experience and potentially
   foster patient behaviours toward a therapeutic advantage. An
   understanding of these factors in the context of orthopaedic clinics is
   also important in the development of questionnaires designed to evaluate
   patient satisfaction with health service delivery. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Patients' perceptions of care quality within and across
   settings are important for the further development of palliative care.
   The aim was to investigate patients' perceptions of palliative care
   quality within settings, including perceptions of care received and
   their subjective importance, and contrast palliative care quality across
   settings.
   Method: A cross-sectional study including 191 patients in late
   palliative phase (73 \% response rate) admitted to hospice inpatient
   care, hospice day care, palliative units in nursing homes, and home care
   was conducted, using the Quality from the Patients' Perspective
   instrument-palliative care (QPP-PC). QPP-PC comprises four dimensions
   and 12 factors; ``medical-technical competence{''}(MT) (2 factors),
   ``physical-technical conditions{''}(PT) (one factor),
   ``identity-orientation approach{''}(ID) (4 factors), ``sociocultural
   atmosphere{''}(SC) (5 factors), and three single items (S); medical
   care, personal hygiene and atmosphere. Data were analysed using
   paired-samples t-test and analysis of covariance while controlling for
   differences in patient characteristics.
   Results: Patients' perceptions of care received within settings showed
   high scores for the factors and single items ``honesty{''}(ID) and
   ``atmosphere{''}(S) in all settings and low scores for
   ``exhaustion{''}(MT) in three out of four settings. Patients'
   perceptions of importance scored high for ``medical care{''}(S),
   ``honesty{''}(ID), ``respect and empathy{''}(ID) and ``atmosphere{''}(S)
   in all settings. No aspects of care scored low in all settings.
   Importance scored higher than perceptions of care received, in
   particular for receiving information. Patients' perceptions of care
   across settings differed, with highest scores in hospice inpatient care
   for the dimensions; ID, SC, and ``medical care{''}(S), the SC and
   ``atmosphere{''}(S) for hospice day care, and ``medical care{''}(S) for
   palliative units in nursing homes. There were no differences in
   subjective importance across settings.
   Conclusion: Strengths of services related to identity-orientation
   approach and a pleasant and safe atmosphere. Key areas for improvement
   related to receiving information. Perceptions of subjective importance
   did not differ across settings, but perceptions of care received scored
   higher in more care areas for hospice inpatient care, than in other
   settings. Further studies are needed to support these findings, to
   investigate why perceptions of care differ across settings and to
   highlight what can be learned from settings receiving high scores.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Physician empathy is associated with improved diabetes
   outcomes. However, empathy declines throughout medical school training.
   This study seeks to describe how comics on diabetes affect learning
   processes for empathy in medical students.
   Methods: All first-or second-year students at a Canadian medical school
   were invited to provide written reflections on two comics regarding
   diabetes and participate in a focus group. Responses were analyzed
   qualitatively for emergent themes. Students completed the Jefferson
   Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) at baseline, after the comic, and
   after the focus group. Linear mixed model statistical analyses were
   performed.
   Results: Thirteen first-year and 12 second-year students participated.
   Qualitative analysis revealed four themes: 1) Empathy decline and its
   barriers; 2) Impact of the comic and focus group on knowledge, attitudes
   and skills; 3) Role of the comic in the curriculum as a reminder tool of
   the importance of empathy; 4) Comics as an effective medium. Baseline
   mean JSPE scores were 116.4 (SD 10.5) and trended up to 117.2 (SD 12.5)
   and 119.6 (SD 15.2) after viewing the comics and participating in the

   Method
   Participants were 808 medical students from The University of
   Queensland. An online questionnaire collected socio-demographics and the
   Temperament and Character Inventory to assess personality traits. Latent
   profile analyses identified students' trait profiles.
   Results
   Two distinct personality profiles were identified. Profile 1
   ({''}Resilient{''}) characterized 60\% of the sample and was
   distinguished by low Harm Avoidance combined with very high Persistence,
   Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness compared toProfile 2
   ({''}Conscientious{''}). BothProfiles had average levels of Reward
   Dependence and Novelty Seeking and low levels of Self-Transcendence.
   Profiles did not differ by age, gender, or country of birth, but rural
   background students were more likely to have Profile 1. While both
   Profiles indicate mature and healthy personalities, the combination of
   traits in Profile 1 is more strongly indicative of well-being and
   resilience.
   Conclusions
   Finding two distinct profiles of personality highlights the importance
   of considering combinations of traits and how they may interact with
   medical students' potential for well-being. Although both profiles of
   students show healthy personalities, many may lack the resilience to
   maintain well-being over years of medical training. Programs that
   develop character and personality self-awareness would enhance their
   well-being and prepare them to promote the health of their patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Variation in emergency physician computed tomography (CT)
   imaging utilization is well described, but little is known about what
   drives it. Physician empathy has been proposed as a potential
   characteristic affecting CT utilization.
   Objectives: The objective was to describe empathy in a cohort of
   emergency physicians and evaluate its association with CT utilization.
   We also sought to compare emergency physician performance on an empathy
   psychometric test with performance on other psychometric tests
   previously proposed as predictors of CT utilization.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included two parts: 1) a secondary
   analysis of emergency department (ED) CT imaging utilization data in a
   large health system from July 2013 to June 2014 and 2) a survey study of
   the cohort of physicians responsible for this imaging using four
   psychometric scales: the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE), a risk-taking
   subset of the Jackson Personality Index (RTS), the Stress from
   Uncertainty Scale (SUS), and the Malpractice Fear Scale (MFS). The study
   included data and physicians from four EDs: one urban, academic ED, two
   community, and one free-standing. A hierarchical, mixed-effects
   regression model was used to evaluate the association between emergency
   physician performance on the four scales and risk-adjusted CT imaging
   utilization. The model incorporated physician-specific CT utilization
   rates adjusted for propensity scores that were calculated using over 500
   patient-level variables via random forest methods, physician
   demographics, and a random provider effect to account for the clustering
   of observations.
   Results: CT variation analysis included 113,517 patients seen during the
   study period by the 74 eligible emergency physician survey respondents;
   20,972 (18.5\%) of these patients had at least one CT. The survey
   response rate was 74 of 82 (90.2\%). Correlation coefficients between
   JSE and the other scales were not statistically significant. In subset
   analysis, there was a trend toward a physician's number of years in
   practice and RTS score contributing to CT utilization for traumatic head
   CT. There were no significant associations between performance on any of
   the psychometric scales and CT utilization.
   Conclusions: Performance on the JSE, RTS, SUS, or MFS was not predictive
   of risk-adjusted CT utilization in the ED. The underlying
   physician-based factors that mediate interphysician variation remain to
   be clearly identified. (C) 2016 by the Society for Academic Emergency

Abstract = {{Several studies suggest that the disorders of the self include a
   disturbance of the most elementary component of self - the minimal self.
   Characterizing these disorders and understanding the mechanisms involved
   remain a challenge to medical epistemology and health care
   professionals. In the present work, I bring together concepts of
   different fields, such as neuroscience, epistemology and phenomenology.
   The main goal is to show that the second-person perspective can be used
   to point out particular features of social cognition and its related
   psychopathology. Taking the hypothesis that the second-person
   perspective is the congruence point between an objective process and the
   subjective experience, I will attempt to explain schizophrenia as a
   self-related deficit, first in the light of the first-person and the
   third-person perspective and afterward, in the light of the poorly less
   understood second-person perspective. On the one hand, the first-person
   experience is correlated both with space and time. In fact, psychiatric
   patients report subjective experiences that can be understood within
   research on the bodily self, such as (1) spatially incongruent
   proprioception and (2) impaired sense of time as the basic mechanism
   that allows conscious experience. On the other hand, the second-person
   approach has already begun to prove productive within social cognition
   research, pointing out the importance of experiencing and interacting
   with others as our primarily way well-being. I will phenomenological
   analyse subjective and intersubjective experience in the disorders of
   the self and derive practical consequences to evidence-based medicine.}},

Abstract = {{For palliative care (PC) clinicians, the work of caring for patients
   with serious illness can put their own well-being at risk. What they
   often do not learn in training, because of the relative paucity of
   evidence-based programs, are practical ways to mitigate this risk.
   Because a new study indicates that burnout in PC clinicians is
   increasing, we sought to design an acceptable, scalable, and testable
   intervention tailored to the needs of PC clinicians. In this article, we
   describe our paradigm for approaching clinician resilience, our
   conceptual model, and curriculum for a workplace resilience intervention
   for hospital-based PC teams. Our paradigm for approaching resilience is
   based on upstream, early intervention. Our conceptual model posits that
   clinician well-being is influenced by personal resources and work
   demands. Our curriculum for increasing clinician resilience is based on
   training in eight resilience skills that are useful for common
   challenges faced by clinicians. To address workplace issues, our
   intervention also includes material for the team leader and a clinician
   perception survey of work demands and workplace engagement factors. The
   intervention will focus on individual skill building and will be
   evaluated with measures of resilience, coping, and affect. For PC
   clinicians, resilience skills are likely as important as communication
   skills and symptom management as foundations of expertise. Future work
   to strengthen clinician resilience will likely need to address system
   issues more directly. (C) 2016 American Academy of Hospice and

Abstract = {{The NYC Rheumatology Objective Structured Clinical Examination
   (NYC-ROSCE) is held annually to assess fellow competencies. We recently
   redesigned our OSCE to better assess subspecialty trainee communication
   skills and professionalism by developing scenarios in which the patients
   encountered were psychosocially or medically complex. The objective of
   this study is to identify which types of verbal and non-verbal skills
   are most important in the perception of professionalism in the
   patient-physician interaction. The 2012-2013 NYC-ROSCEs included a total
   of 53 fellows: 55 MD evaluators from 7 NYC rheumatology training
   programs (Hospital for Special Surgery-Weill Cornell (HSS),
   SUNY/Downstate, NYU, Einstein, Columbia, Mount Sinai, and North
   Shore/Long Island Jewish (NSLIJ)), and 55 professional
   actors/standardized patients participated in 5 stations. Quantitative
   fellow performance assessments were made on the following: maintaining
   composure; partnering with the patient; honesty; professionalism;
   empathy; and accountability. Free-text comments were solicited regarding
   specific strengths and weaknesses. A total of 53/53 eligible (100 \%)
   fellows were evaluated. MD evaluators rated fellows lower for
   professionalism than did the standardized patients (6.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.4
   +/- 0.8, p = 0.05), suggesting that physicians and patients view
   professionalism somewhat differently. Fellow self-evaluations for
   professionalism (6.6 +/- 1.2) were concordant with those of the MD
   evaluators. Ratings of empathy by fellows themselves (6.6 +/- 1.0), MD
   evaluators (6.6 +/- 0.7), and standardized patients (6.6 +/- 1.1) agreed
   closely. Jargon use, frequently cited by evaluators, showed a moderate
   association with lower professionalism ratings by both MD evaluators and
   patients. Psychosocially challenging patient encounters in the NYC-ROSCE
   permitted critical assessment of the patient-centered traits
   contributing to impressions of professionalism and indicate that
   limiting medical jargon is an important component of the competency of
   professionalism.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Skilled physician communication is a key component of

   skills training and its impact on patient satisfaction have not been
   conducted.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of experiential
   relationship-centered physician communication skills training on patient
   satisfaction and physician experience.
   DESIGN: This was an observational study.
   SETTING: The study was conducted at a large, multispecialty academic
   medical center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 1537 attending physicians who
   participated in, and 1951 physicians who did not participate in,
   communication skills training between 1 August 2013 and 30 April 2014.
   INTERVENTION: An 8-h block of interactive didactics, live or video skill
   demonstrations, and small group and large group skills practice sessions
   using a relationship-centered model.
   MAIN MEASURES: Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
   Systems (HCAHPS), Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
   Providers and Systems (CGCAHPS), Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE),
   Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), self-efficacy, and post course
   satisfaction.
   KEY RESULTS: Following the course, adjusted overall CGCAHPS scores for
   physician communication were higher for intervention physicians than for
   controls (92.09 vs. 91.09, p < 0.03). No significant interactions were
   noted between physician specialty or baseline CGCAHPS and improvement
   following the course. Significant improvement in the post-course HCAHPS
   Respect domain adjusted mean was seen in intervention versus control
   groups (91.08 vs. 88.79, p = 0.02) and smaller, non-statistically
   significant improvements were also seen for adjusted HCAHPS
   communication scores (83.95 vs. 82.73, p = 0.22). Physicians reported
   high course satisfaction and showed significant improvement in empathy
   (116.4 +/- 12.7 vs. 124 +/- 11.9, p < 0.001) and burnout, including all
   measures of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal
   accomplishment. Less depersonalization and greater personal
   accomplishment were sustained for at least 3 months.

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic pain (CP) care in the patient-centered medical home

   Methods: Chart reviews were completed for 12 primary care practices
   affiliated with one health system in the Cincinnati Area Research and
   Improvement Group (CARInG). Recommendations were abstracted and compared
   based on PCMH status: 3 practices had received prior PCMH level 3
   recognition, 5 were in an ongoing process of applying, and 4 had no
   recognition and were not applying.
   Results: A total of 485 charts were reviewed from 65 PCPs. Eight of 10
   key recommendations were documented more often in the prior and ongoing
   PCMH cohorts, including assessing pain severity, function, psychosocial
   distress, and substance abuse, and using structured instruments for
   these assessments. There were fewer differences between the cohorts in

Abstract = {{Professional doctor-patient-parent communication is a genuine lifelong
   challenge. Doctors who are constantly under time pressure would
   therefore benefit from effective communication skills in the clinical
   routine of pediatric and adolescent medicine.
   Efficient communication skills can be trained and acquired by doctors.
   This article presents an overview of key aspects of communication in the
   clinical practice and reveals important factors for a successful
   doctor-patient-parent interaction.
   In this article practical examples, references and practice-oriented
   recommendations are used to illustrate the principles of communication
   theory. The difficulties of communicating with the parents of sick
   children are demonstrated and solutions to overcome these hurdles are
   provided. Established knowledge of communication theories is also
   included.
   In the challenging communication triangle involving the doctor, parents
   and child, pediatricians must make the conversational partner the center
   of communication behavior. With the help of nonverbal and verbal
   intervention techniques a doctor can identify problems arising with
   parents of sick children and treat them using communication strategies,
   such as body language, empathy, active listening skills and conversation
   management. Doctors who practice communication skills gain confidence in
   the daily interaction with patients and parents. Empathic communication
   and clear linguistic expression increase the therapy success and job
   satisfaction.
   Pediatricians should receive professional training in communication
   skills, which would enable them to be better prepared for the clinical
   work. These findings are increasingly being applied in medical education
   and specialty training.}},

Title = {{Detached concern?: Emotional socialization in twenty-first century
   medical education}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{94-101}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Early works in medical sociology have been pivotal in the development of
   scholarly knowledge about emotions, emotional socialization, and empathy
   within medical training, medical education, and medical contexts. Yet
   despite major shifts in both medical education and in medicine
   writ-large, medical sociologists' focus on emotions has largely
   disappeared. In this paper, we argue that due to recent radical
   transformations in the medical arena, emotional socialization within
   medical education should be of renewed interest for sociologists.
   Developments in medical education such as increased diversity among
   enrollees, the rise of patient health movements, and curricular
   transformation have made this context a particularly interesting case
   for sociologists working on a variety of questions related to
   structural, organizational, and cultural change. We offer three areas of
   debate within studies in medical education that sociologists may be
   interested in studying: 1) gendered and racialized differences in the
   performance of clinical skills related to emotion, 2) differences in
   self-reported empathy among subspecialties, and 3) loss of empathy
   during the third year or clinical year of medical school. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Problem: Medical student mistreatment, as well as patient and staff
   mistreatment by all levels of medical trainees and faculty, is still
   prevalent in U.S. clinical training. Largely missing in interventions to
   reduce mistreatment is acknowledgement of the abuse of power produced by
   the hierarchical structure in which medicine is practiced. Approach:
   Beginning in 2001, Yale School of Medicine has held annual ``Power
   Day{''} workshops for third year medical students and advanced practice
   nursing students, to define and analyse power dynamics within the
   medical hierarchy and hidden curriculum using literature, guest
   speakers, and small groups. During rotations, medical students write
   narratives about the use of power witnessed in the wards. In response to
   student and small group leader feedback, workshop organizers have
   developed additional activities related to examining and changing the
   use of power in clinical teams. Outcome: Emerging narrative themes
   included the potential impact of small acts and students feeling
   ``mute{''} and ``complicit{''} in morally distressing situations. Small
   groups provided safe spaces for advice, support, and professional
   identity formation. By 2005, students recognized residents that used
   power positively with Power Day awards and alumni served as keynote
   speakers on the use of power in medicine. By 2010, departments including
   OB/GYN, surgery, psychiatry, and paediatrics, had added weekly team
   Power Hour discussions. Next Steps: The authors highlight barriers,
   benefits, and lessons learned. Barriers include the notion of clinical
   irrelevance and resistance to the word ``power{''} due to perceived
   accusation of abuse. Benefits include promoting open dialogue about
   power, fostering inter-professional collaboration, rewarding positive
   role modelling by residents and faculty, and creating a network of
   trainee empowerment and leadership. Furthermore, faculty have started to
   ask that issues of power be addressed in a more transparent way at their
   level of the hierarchy as well.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal length of medical
   training, with concern about the cost of prolonged training. Two
   simultaneous tracks currently exist in Australia: direct entry from high
   school and graduate entry for students with a bachelor degree. Medical
   schools are switching to graduate entry based on maturity, academic
   preparedness and career-choice surety. We tested the assumption that
   graduate entry is better by exploring student preferences, coping,
   burnout, empathy and alcohol use.
   METHODS From a potential pool of 2188 participants, enrolled at five
   Australian medical schools, a convenience sample of 688 (31\%) first and
   second year students completed a survey in the middle of the academic
   year. Participants answered questions about demographics, satisfaction
   and coping and completed three validated instruments.
   RESULTS Over 90\% of students preferred their own entry-type, though
   more graduate-entry students were satisfied with their programme (82.4\%
   versus 65.3\%, p < 0.001). There was no difference between
   graduate-entry and direct-entry students in self-reported coping or in
   the proportion of students meeting criteria for burnout (50.7\% versus
   51.2\%). Direct-entry students rated significantly higher for empathy
   (concern, p = 0.022; personal distress, p = 0.031). Graduate-entry
   students reported significantly more alcohol use and hazardous drinking
   (30.0\% versus 22.8\%; p = 0.017).
   CONCLUSIONS Our multi-institution data confirm that students are
   generally satisfied with their choice of entry pathway and do not
   confirm significant psychosocial benefits of graduate entry. Overall,
   our data suggest that direct-entry students cope with the workload and
   psychosocial challenges of medical school, in the first 2 years, as well
   as graduate-entry students. Burnout and alcohol use should be addressed
   in both pathways. Despite studies showing similar academic outcomes, and
   higher total costs, more programmes in Australia are becoming graduate
   entry. Further research on non-cognitive issues and outcomes is needed
   so that universities, government funders and the medical profession can
   decide whether graduate entry, direct entry, or a mix, is ideal.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the growing prominence of professional
   (non-technical) competencies in veterinary education, the evidence to
   support their importance to veterinary graduates is unclear.Aim: To
   summarize current evidence within the veterinary literature for the
   importance of professional competencies to graduate success.Methods: A
   systematic search of electronic databases was conducted (CAB Abstracts,
   Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, Australian and British Education
   Index, Dissertations \& Theses) from 1988 to 2015 and limited to the
   veterinary discipline (veterinar{*} term required). Evidence was sought
   from consensus-based competence frameworks, surveys of stakeholder
   perceptions, and empirical evidence linked to relevant outcomes (e.g.
   employability, client satisfaction or compliance). Data extraction was
   completed by two independent reviewers and included a quality assessment
   of each source.Results: Fifty-two sources were included in the review,
   providing evidence from expert frameworks (10 sources), stakeholder
   perceptions (30 sources, including one from the previous category), and
   empirical research (13 sources). Communication skills were the only
   competency to be well-supported by all three categories of evidence.
   Other competencies supported by multiple sources of empirical evidence
   include empathy, relationship-centered care, self-efficacy, and business
   skills. Other competencies perceived to be relatively more important
   included awareness of limitations, professional values, critical
   thinking, collaboration, and resilience.Conclusions: This review has
   highlighted the comparatively weak body of evidence supporting the
   importance of professional competencies for veterinary graduate success,
   with the exception of communication skills. However we stress this is
   more indicative of the scarcity of high-quality veterinary-based
   education research in the field, than of the true priority of these
   competencies.}},

Abstract = {{The semiologic collection requires in psychiatry: a conceptual framework
   in which the semiologic terms are collected and organized in a
   consistent way and a clinical practice to acquire the necessary skills
   during the interview with a patient. Symptoms affect different
   dimensions of the patient's experience and behavior. The symptoms are
   particularly associated with the situation in which the subject lives.
   Thus, to collect valid symptoms, the physician should be attentively
   interested to this situation of life. This interest cannot be
   improvised. A set of interpersonal skills is required during the
   interview to obtain the confidence of the subject. The building of
   patient confidence is a process called ``engagement{''}. This engagement
   process leads to what is traditionally called an alliance (which is the
   result of the engagement process). In order to succeed the engagement
   process, the physician will try to answer 4 questions that the patient
   might ask: does this doctor understand me? Does this doctor judge me? Is
   this doctor friendly? Is this doctor competent? Each of these issues is
   a relational competence of the physician: empathy, sense of security,
   authenticity, and competence. This article will introduce these four
   elements as part of a practical medical model to a valid semiologic

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to investigate how healthcare personnel
   self-evaluate their ability to relate to patients in day-to-day practice

   Methods: A sample of 600 healthcare personnel, recruited among eight
   hospitals in various parts of Italy, completed the 16-item
   Provider-Patient Relationship Questionnaire (PPRQ). A sample of 50
   nurses answered the PPRQ twice, at a four-week interval. The PPRQ
   validity, reliability and susceptibility to social desirability were
   tested.
   Results: PPRQ showed good reliability and structural validity, with four
   first-order factors: effective communication, interest in the patient's
   agenda, empathy, and patient involvement in care. Correlation with
   social desirability was negligible. Participants rated themselves as
   highly competent in communicating with patients, but less interested in

Abstract = {{Introduction: Physician empathy is a complex phenomenon known to improve
   illness outcomes; however, few tools are available for deliberate
   practice of empathy. We used a virtual patient (VP) to teach empathic
   communication to first-year medical students. We then evaluated
   students' verbal empathy in a standardized patient (SP) interaction.
   Methods: Seventy medical students, randomly assigned to 3 separate study
   groups, interacted with (1) a control VP portraying depression, (2) a VP
   with a backstory simulating patient shadowing, or (3) a VP able to give
   immediate feedback about empathic communication (empathy-feedback VP).
   Subsequently, the students interviewed an SP portraying a scenario that
   included opportunities to express empathy. All SP interviews were
   recorded and transcribed. The study outcomes were (1) the students'
   verbal response to the empathic opportunities presented by the SP, as
   coded by reliable assessors using the Empathic Communication Coding
   System, and (2) the students' responses as coded by the SPs, using a
   communication checklist.
   Results: There were no significant differences in student demographics
   between groups. The students who interacted with the empathy-feedback VP
   showed higher empathy in the SP interview than did the students in the
   backstory VP and the control VP groups {[}mean (SD) empathy scores coded
   on a 0-6 scale were 2.91 (0.16) vs. 2.20 (0.22) and 2.27 (0.21),
   respectively). The difference in scores was significant only for the
   empathy-feedback VP versus the backstory VP group (P = 0.027). The SPs
   rated the empathy-feedback and the backstory VP groups significantly
   higher than the control VP group on offering empathic statements (P <
   0.0001), appearing warm and caring (P = 0.015), and forming rapport (P =
   0.004).
   Conclusions: Feedback on empathy in a VP interaction increased students'
   empathy in encounters with SPs, as rated by trained assessors, whereas a
   simulation of patient shadowing did not. Both VP interventions increased
   students' empathy as rated by SPs, compared with the control VP group.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{1-5}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: It has been shown that empathy strengthens the relationship
   between patients and health professionals and also improves patient and
   health professional satisfaction, which helps promote the best clinical
   outcomes. Empathy is considered an essential prerequisite for a nurse to
   effectively care for a patient and for a holistic understanding of a
   patient's perspective in a student population.
   Objectives: The main aim was to compare empathy levels between health
   professional students attending different university courses.
   Design: A comparative study with a cross-sectional approach was
   conducted in two successive academic year cohorts of 1st year health
   professional students at a public Italian university.
   Participants and Methods: A sample of 1st year health professional
   students at a public Italian university was investigated using the
   Jefferson Scale of Empathy Health Professional Students version
   (JSE-HPS).
   Results: Overall, 502 health professional students were included in the
   study. The students in nursing showed significantly higher empathy
   levels than the students in other health professions. Furthermore, the
   female students were found to exhibit significantly more overall empathy
   than the male students were.
   Conclusions: The undergraduate nursing students showed a significantly
   higher mean score of empathy measured by the Jefferson Scale of Empathy
   Health Professional Students version (JSE-HPS) than the students
   attending other health undergraduate courses. This could mean that a
   particular aptitude in establishing a help relationship with other

   neonatal intensive care: a focus group study for media design}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: For parents whose child may require admission to a neonatal
   intensive care unit (NICU), the antenatal consultation is often their
   first point of contact with the child's medical team. Consultation
   challenges health professionals, as parents may be anxious, overwhelmed,
   or even exhausted by what is and what might occur. Despite consultation
   being a common practice, there is a paucity of research on how to
   support practitioners and parents. The purpose of this study was to gain
   insights into important relational aspects of antenatal consultation
   that may be used to spur the development of media to support
   consultation.
   Methods: Focus group, as a data collection method, was employed to
   gather insights about antenatal consultation from a total of 50 hospital
   staff and 17 NICU parents from a large urban NICU program in western
   Canada. Qualitative content analysis was applied to the obtained
   materials to explicate themes that may serve as necessary understandings
   for media design.
   Results: Participating hospital staff and parents expressed their desire
   for a good antenatal consultation with comments grouped under the
   following themes: supporting the building of a caring relation; sharing
   information in conversation; and, preparing for what is to come.
   Conclusions: To support the emerging relations of baby, parent, and
   hospital staff, a good antenatal consultation needs to convey care,
   understanding, and empathy; create possibilities for open and genuine
   conversations; and, foster the buildings of respect, confidence, and
   trust.}},

Title = {{Enhancing student perspectives of humanism in medicine: reflections from
   the Kalaupapa service learning project}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Service learning is endorsed by the Liaison Committee on
   Medical Education (LCME) as an integral part of U.S. medical school
   curricula for future physicians. Service learning has been shown to help
   physicians in training rediscover the altruistic reasons for pursuing
   medicine and has the potential to enhance students' perspectives of
   humanism in medicine. The Kalaupapa service learning project is a unique
   collaboration between disadvantaged post-baccalaureate students with an
   underserved rural community. This study was conducted to determine
   whether the Kalaupapa service learning curricula enhanced student
   perspectives of humanism in medicine at an early stage of their medical
   training.
   Method: Program participants between 2008 and 2014 (n = 41) completed
   written reflections following the conclusion of the service learning
   project. Four prompts guided student responses. Reflections were
   thematically analyzed. Once all essays were read, team members compared
   their findings to condense or expand themes and assess levels of
   agreement.
   Results: Emerging themes of resilience and unity were prominent
   throughout the student reflections. Students expressed respect and
   empathy for the patients' struggles and strengths, as well as those of
   their peers. The experience also reinforced students' commitment to
   service, particularly to populations in rural and underserved
   communities. Students also gained a deeper understanding of the patient
   experience and also of themselves as future physicians.
   Conclusion: To identify and address underserved and rural patients'
   health care needs, training programs must prepare an altruistic health
   care workforce that embraces the humanistic element of medicine. The
   Kalaupapa service learning project is a potential curricular model that
   can be used to enhance students' awareness and perspectives of humanism
   in medicine.}},

   on tasks measuring the affective subdomain of empathy. This study
   further examined affective empathy in 21 schizophrenia outpatients and
   21 healthy controls using a validated pain empathy paradigm with two
   components: (i) observing videos of people described as medical patients
   who were receiving a painful sound stimulation treatment; (ii) listening
   to the painful sounds (to create regions of interest). The observing
   videos component incorporated experimental manipulations of perspective
   taking (instructions to imagine `Self' vs `Other' experiencing pain) and
   cognitive appraisal (information about whether treatment was `Effective'
   vs `Not Effective'). When considering activation across experimental
   conditions, both groups showed similar dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) activation while merely observing others
   in pain. However, there were group differences associated with
   perspective taking: controls showed relatively greater dACC and AI
   activation for the Self vs Other contrast whereas patients showed
   relatively greater activation in these and additional regions for the
   Other vs Self contrast. Although patients demonstrated grossly intact
   neural activity while observing others in pain, they showed more subtle
   abnormalities when required to toggle between imagining themselves vs
   others experiencing pain.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE Patient participation in clinical decision making improves
   outcomes, including quality of life (QOL), but the typical
   problem-oriented approach may impede consideration of functional goals.
   We wondered if patients could encourage primary care physicians to pay
   attention to their QOL goals by writing them on pre-encounter forms.
   METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact
   of 2 different pre-visit questionnaires on the content of
   patient-physician encounters in a family medicine practice at an
   academic medical center. Using investigator-blinded block randomization,
   we arranged for 8 faculty and 8 resident physicians to participate in 2
   intervention and 2 control videotaped encounters each for a total of 64
   encounters. The intervention questionnaire included questions about QOL
   goals and concerns, while the control questionnaire asked about
   symptoms. Videotapes were reviewed to determine whether the patients'
   QOL goals were mentioned and whether they were used in decision making.
   We also scored encounters using Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis,
   which assesses and codifies patient and physician communication, and the
   Modified Carkhuff-Truax Scale, which measures empathy, attending,
   congruence, and positive regard.
   RESULTS Patients were able to record QOL goals and concerns, but QOL
   issues were mentioned in only 2 of the 64 encounters, once by a patient
   and once by a physician. In neither case was this information used in
   decision making. More empathy was expressed by physicians during control
   encounters (P = .03).
   CONCLUSIONS Patients were able to articulate their QOL goals on paper,
   but that did not prime them or their physicians to alter the process or
   content of the clinical encounters. In fact, providing QOL information
   was associated with reduced physician empathy.}},

Journal = {{NURSING ETHICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{308-317}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fear and aggression are often reported among professionals
   working in locked psychiatric wards and also among the patients in the
   same wards. Such situations often lead to coercive intervention. In
   order to prevent coercion, we need to understand what happens in
   dangerous situations and how patients and professionals interpret them.
   Research questions: What happens when dangerous situations occur in a
   ward? How do professionals and patients interpret these situations and
   what is ethically at stake?
   Research design: Participant observation and interviews.
   Participants: A total of 12 patients and 22 professionals participated.
   Ethical considerations: This study has been accepted by the Regional
   Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway.
   Findings: (a) Both atmosphere and material surroundings were interweaved
   within dangerous situations, (b) the professionals applied stereotypes
   when interpreting dangerous situations and (c) the professionals and the
   patients had different interpretations of what triggered dangerous
   situations.
   Discussion: The discussion centres on how care ethics and a dialogical
   practice might contribute towards combating difficult situations and the
   ways in which change is an ongoing ethical process of becoming.
   Conclusion: The ethics of care and a dialogical approach are suggested
   as ethical frameworks for preventing fear, danger and aggression in
   psychiatric wards. Both frameworks can be understood as patient-driven,
   including the relational and contextual perspectives. It means a shift
   from professionally driven processes to patient-driven dialogue.}},

Title = {{Decline in medical students' attitudes to interprofessional learning and
   patient-centredness}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{ContextInterprofessional learning (IPL) is valuable in preparing health
   care students to work collaboratively in teams, with patients' needs at
   the core. Patient-centredness is the impetus for communication and
   collaboration in health care. Debate continues on when it is best to
   develop positive student attitudes towards these aspects of care. Should
   IPL commence early before attitudes to patients, professional
   stereotypes and identity are formed, or later for advanced learners with
   greater experience of their roles and responsibility in health care?
   This study explores graduate-entry medical students' attitudes to IPL
   and patient-centred care, on programme entry and after an early
   interdisciplinary clinical experience (ICE).
   MethodsAn extended version of the Readiness for Interprofessional
   Learning Scale (RIPLS) was administered to four cohorts of medical
   students (n=279) on entry and after the 3-week placement. This 26-item
   RIPLS comprised four subscales: team work and collaboration;
   professional identity; roles and responsibilities; and
   patient-centredness. The impact of the placement on students' attitudes
   was assessed by using repeated measures analysis of variance to compare
   pre- and post-ICE subscale scores.
   ResultsThere were significant main effects of time (pre- versus
   post-ICE) for the subscales of teamwork and collaboration, professional
   identity and patient-centredness, but not for roles and
   responsibilities. Scores for teamwork and collaboration, professional
   identity and patient-centredness were all lower post-ICE.
   ConclusionsThe students' less positive attitudes to teamwork and
   collaboration and professional identity may be due to the experience
   itself, or because it reinforced negative beliefs about the value of
   learning from non-medical health professionals. Perhaps the students'
   idealised view of their future role as a doctor was challenged by the
   experience, or they had an underdeveloped professional identity. Limited
   student experience of patients having an active role in their own health
   care may explain the decrease in attitudes to patient-centredness. A
   longitudinal qualitative study will explore these results.

Title = {{Medical errors: Disclosure styles, interpersonal forgiveness, and
   outcomes}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{29-38}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: This study investigates the intrapersonal and interpersonal
   factors and processes that are associated with patient forgiveness of a
   provider in the aftermath of a harmful medical error.
   Objective: This study aims to examine what antecedents are most
   predictive of patient forgiveness and non-forgiveness, and the extent to
   which social-cognitive factors (i.e., fault attributions, empathy,
   rumination) influence the forgiveness process. Furthermore, the study
   evaluates the role of different disclosure styles in two different
   forgiveness models, and measures their respective causal outcomes.
   Methods: In January 2011, 318 outpatients at Wake Forest Baptist Medical
   Center in the United States were randomly assigned to three hypothetical
   error disclosure vignettes that operationalized verbally effective
   disclosures with different nonverbal disclosure styles (i.e., high
   nonverbal involvement, low nonverbal involvement, written disclosure
   vignette without nonverbal information). All patients responded to the
   same forgiveness-related self-report measures after having been exposed
   to one of the vignettes.
   Results: The results favored the proximity model of interpersonal
   forgiveness, which implies that factors more proximal in time to the act
   of forgiving (i.e., patient rumination and empathy for the offender) are
   more predictive of forgiveness and non-forgiveness than less proximal
   factors (e.g., relationship variables and offense-related factors such
   as the presence or absence of an apology). Patients' fault attributions
   had no effect on their forgiveness across conditions. The results
   evidenced sizeable effects of physician nonverbal involvement-patients
   in the low nonverbal involvement condition perceived the error as more
   severe, experienced the physician's apology as less sincere, were more
   likely to blame the physician, felt less empathy, ruminated more about
   the error, were less likely to forgive and more likely to avoid the
   physician, reported less closeness, trust, and satisfaction but higher
   distress, were more likely to change doctors, less compliant, and more
   likely to seek legal advice.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study imply that physician nonverbal
   involvement during error disclosures stimulates a healing mechanism for
   patients and the physician-patient relationship. Physicians who disclose
   a medical error in a nonverbally uninvolved way, on the other hand,
   carry a higher malpractice risk and are less likely to promote healthy,
   reconciliatory outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Behavioral and social science (BSS) competencies are needed to provide
   quality health care, but psychometrically validated measures to assess
   these competencies are difficult to find. Moreover, they have not been
   mapped to existing frameworks, like those from the Liaison Committee on
   Medical Education (LCME) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
   Education (ACGME). This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate
   the quality of assessment tools used to measure BSS competencies.
   Method
   The authors searched the literature published between January 2002 and
   March 2014 for articles reporting psychometric or other
   validity/reliability testing, using OVID, CINAHL, PubMed, ERIC, Research
   and Development Resource Base, SOCIOFILE, and PsycINFO. They reviewed
   5,104 potentially relevant titles and abstracts. To guide their review,
   they mapped BSS competencies to existing LCME and ACGME frameworks. The
   final included articles fell into three categories: instrument
   development, which were of the highest quality; educational research,
   which were of the second highest quality; and curriculum evaluation,
   which were of lower quality.
   Results
   Of the 114 included articles, 33 (29\%) yielded strong evidence
   supporting tools to assess communication skills, cultural competence,
   empathy/compassion, behavioral health counseling, professionalism, and
   teamwork. Sixty-two (54\%) articles yielded moderate evidence and 19
   (17\%) weak evidence. Articles mapped to all LCME standards and ACGME
   core competencies; the most common was communication skills.
   Conclusions
   These findings serve as a valuable resource for medical educators and
   researchers. More rigorous measurement validation and testing and more
   robust study designs are needed to understand how educational strategies
   contribute to BSS competency development.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy towards animals and beliefs in animal-human continuity appear to
   play an important role in shaping the human-animal relationship and in
   determining the way animals are treated and cared for. Veterinary
   medicine plays a central role in animal welfare and has been recognised
   as a highly caring profession, especially in companion animal practice:
   however, a number of studies have indicated that veterinary students
   show a decline in empathy towards animals and an increasing tendency to
   see them in Cartesian terms as they progress through veterinary
   education. In the present study we used the Animal Empathy Scale and the
   Human-Animal Continuity Scale to investigate empathy towards animals and
   beliefs in animal-human continuity in a sample of first-year (n = 131)
   and final-year (n = 158) veterinary students of the University of Milan,
   Italy. Results revealed a difference in empathy towards animals, with
   first-year students scoring significantly higher than those at the end
   of their academic training. This variation in empathy over time emerged
   in both male and female students, however females always had higher
   empathy scores than males. Moreover, veterinary students at the end of
   their course reported a more instrumental attitude toward animals, more
   pronounced in males than in females. Similarly, there was a difference
   in the perception of continuity between humans and animals which was
   more evident in males, with first-year students scoring higher than
   fifth-year students in some items. Results are discussed in relation to
   previous studies carried out in other countries and, given the
   importance of empathy in the veterinary profession, potential reasons
   underlying its apparent decrease are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the influence of physician empathy (PE), shared

   Methods: Patients with breast or colon cancer (n = 71) completed
   questionnaires immediately following (T1) and three months after a
   consultation (T2). Path analysis was used to examine the relationships
   among patient demographics, patient reports of PE, SDM, the match
   between preferred and perceived decision-making styles, and patient
   decision regret at T2.
   Results: After controlling for clinician clusters, higher PE was
   directly associated with more SDM (beta = 0.43, p < 0.01) and lower
   decision regret (beta = 0.28, p < 0.01). The match between patients'
   preferred and perceived roles was negatively associated with decision
   regret (beta = -0.33, p < 0.01). Patients who participated less than
   desired reported more decision regret at T2. There was no significant
   association between SDM and decision regret (beta = 0.03, p = 0.74).

   Targeting Programs for Curriculum Modification}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Empathy is an essential trait for pharmacists and is
   recognized as a core competency that can be developed in the classroom.
   There is a growing body of data regarding levels of empathy in pharmacy
   students; however, these studies have not measured differences in
   behavioral, cognitive, and emotional empathy. The goal of this study was
   to parse the underlying components of empathy and correlate them to
   psychosocial attributes, with the overall goal of identifying curriculum
   modifications to enhance levels of empathy in pharmacy students.
   Methods: IRB approval was obtained to measure empathy levels in pharmacy
   students attending Midwestern University. An online, anonymous survey
   administered through a secure website (REDCap) was used. This survey
   utilized the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (Medical Student version) and
   included questions regarding demographics and personality traits.
   Empathy questions were sub-divided into behavioral, cognitive, and
   emotional categories. Data are presented as mean +/- SEM with
   significance set at P <= 0.05.
   Results: Three hundred and four pharmacy students at Midwestern
   University participated in a fall survey with an overall response rate
   of 37\%. The average empathy score was 110.4 +/- 0.8 on a scale of
   20-140; which is comparable to empathy scores found by Fjortoff etal,
   (7011) and Van Winkle et al. (2012b). Validating prior research, females
   scored significantly higher than males in empathy as well as behavioral,
   cognitive, and emotional subcomponents. For the entire population,
   emotional empathy was significantly higher than cognitive and behavioral
   empathy (P < 0.05). Furthermore, negative correlations to empathy were
   observed for self-serving behavior (R = 0.490, P < 0.001), medical
   authoritarianism (R = 0.428, P < 0.001), and experience of coercion (R =
   0.344,P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Overall, empathy levels in pharmacy students are similar to
   prior studies with females scoring higher than males. Emotional empathy
   may play a greater role than cognitive and behavioral empathy in this
   group of students. Targeted programs that promote volunteerism and
   activities that foster responsiveness to patient needs may attenuate
   self-serving behavior and medical authoritarianism and, therefore,
   improve empathy levels in pharmacy students.}},
