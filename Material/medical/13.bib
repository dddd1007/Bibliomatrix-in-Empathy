Abstract = {{Objective: To explore human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   patients' attitudes about buprenorphine treatment in office-based and
   opioid treatment program (OTP) settings.
   Methods: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 29 patients
   with coexisting HIV infection and opioid dependence seeking
   buprenorphine maintenance therapy in office-based and OTP settings. We
   used thematic analysis of transcribed audiorecorded interviews to
   identify themes.
   Results: Patients voiced a strong preference for office-based treatment.
   Four themes emerged to explain this preference. First, patients
   perceived the greater convenience of office-based treatment as improving
   their ability to address HIV and other healthcare issues. Second, they
   perceived a strong patient-focused orientation in patient- provider
   relationships, underpinning their preference for office- based care.
   This was manifested as increased trust, listening, empathy, and respect
   from office-based staff and providers. Third, they perceived shared
   power and responsibility in office-based settings. Finally, patients
   viewed office-based treatment as a more supportive environment for
   sobriety and relapse prevention. This was, in part, due to strong
   therapeutic alliances with office-based staff and providers who
   prioritized a harm reduction approach and also the perception that the
   office-based settings were ``safer{''} for sobriety, compared with
   increased opportunities for purchasing and using illicit opiates in OTP
   settings.
   Conclusions: HIV-infected patients with opioid dependence preferred
   office-based buprenorphine, because they perceived it as offering a more
   patient-centered approach to care compared with OTP referral.
   Office-based buprenorphine may facilitate engagement in care for
   patients with coexisting opioid dependence and HIV infection.}},

Title = {{How Do Homeopaths Reason and Make Decisions? Integrating Theory,

Abstract = {{Background: Homeopathy is a major modality in complementary and
   alternative medicine. Significant tensions exist between homeopathic
   practice and education, evident in the diversity of practice styles and
   pedagogic models. Utilizing clinical reasoning knowledge in conventional
   medicine and allied health sciences, this article seeks to identify and
   critique existing research in this important area.
   Materials and methods: A literature search utilizing MEDLINE (R), Allied
   and Complementary Medicine (AMED), and CINAHL (R) (Cumulative Index to
   Nursing and Allied Health Literature) was conducted. Key terms including
   clinical thinking, clinical reasoning, decision-making, homeopathy, and
   complementary medicine were utilized. A critical appraisal of the
   evidence was undertaken.
   Results: Four (4) studies have examined homeopathic clinical reasoning.
   Two (2) studies sought to measure and quantify homeopathic reasoning.
   One (1) study proposed a reasoning model, based on pattern recognition,
   hypothetico-deductive reasoning, intuition, and remedy-matching
   (PHIR-M), resembling much that has been previously mapped in
   conventional medical reasoning research. The fourth closely investigated
   the meaning and use of intuition in homeopathic decision-making.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these four studies provide valuable insight
   into what is currently known about homeopathic clinical reasoning.
   However, despite the history and breadth of practice, little is known
   about homeopathic clinical reasoning and decision-making. Building on
   the research would require viewing clinical reasoning not only as a
   cognitive phenomenon but also as a situated and interactive one. Further
   research into homeopathic clinical reasoning is indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Critiques of the dehumanising aspects of contemporary medical practice
   have generated increasing interest in the ways in which health care can

   This paper makes two simple arguments that are intuitive but have not
   yet been explored in detail: that narrative competence of carers is
   required for maintaining or recreating dignity, and that dignity
   promotion in health care practice is primarily narrative in form. The
   multiple meanings that dignity has in a person's life are what give the
   concept power and can only be captured by narrative. This has
   implications for health care practice where narrative work will be
   increasingly required to support patient dignity in under-resourced and

   experience was used to improve professional nursing students'
   observational and communication skills, narrative sequencing abilities,
   and empathy. The nursing and medical literature describing the use of
   visual art encounters in health care education is reviewed. The
   incorporation of an art education program into the curriculum of a

Title = {{Lack of association between resident doctors' well-being and medical

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1224-1231}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Resident doctors' (residents) well-being impacts on the medical care
   they provide. Despite the high prevalence of resident doctors' distress,
   the relationship between their well-being and the specific competencies
   defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education is
   poorly understood. We evaluated the association of resident well-being
   with medical knowledge as assessed on both a standardised test of
   general medical knowledge and at the end of web-based courses on a
   series of focused topics.
   Methods
   We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study of associations between
   well-being and medical knowledge scores over time for internal medicine
   residents from July 2004 to June 2007. Well-being measures included
   linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) scales measuring quality of life
   (including overall quality of life, mental, physical and emotional
   well-being, and fatigue), the Medical Outcome Study Eight-Item Short
   Form Health Survey (SF-8) assessment of mental and physical well-being,
   the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the PRIME-MD two-item depression
   screen. We also measured empathy using the perspective taking and
   empathic concern subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index.
   Medical knowledge measures included scores on web-based learning module
   post-tests and scores on the national Internal Medicine In-Training
   Examination (IM-ITE). As data for each association were available for at
   least 126 residents, this study was powered to detect a
   small-to-moderate effect size of 0.3 standard deviations.
   Results
   No statistically significant associations were observed between
   well-being and either web-based learning module post-test score or
   IM-ITE score. Parameter estimates of the association of well-being
   variables with knowledge scores were uniformly small. For all well-being
   metrics, meaningful differences were associated with knowledge score
   difference estimates of < 1 percentage point.
   Conclusions
   Resident well-being appears to have limited association with competence
   in medical knowledge as assessed following web-based courses on specific
   topics or using standardised general medical examinations.}},

Abstract = {{Autobiographical narratives of illness and disability are influential in
   popular and medical discourses of illness and disability, in part
   because these narratives represent illness and disability within a
   sociocultural context, intersecting with other categories of difference.
   Clinicians can benefit patients through a critical understanding of the
   formal and social conventions that shape illness and disability
   narratives and the effect these conventions can have on the lived
   experience of illness and disability. I analyze the 2003 edition of Lucy
   Grealy's Autobiography of a Face to illustrate these socio-narrative
   conventions, especially in fight of an afterword that significantly
   revises the ending to C realy's narrative. I explore the parallels
   between narrative conventions-such as the ``recovery narrative{''}-and
   caregivers' expectations that shape the role of the ``good patient,{''}
   as well as the resistance to conventions of closure, represented by the
   ``renegotiated ending.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Martin Buber's concept of inclusion and Gabriel Marcel's notion of
   availability are used to cast new light on the human dimension in
   medical care. Buber's notion of inclusion indicates that clinical
   empathy should involve both cognitive and affective elements. It is
   argued that empathy is more than simply labeling a feeling state.
   Including oneself in the inner reality of the patient involves
   recognizing what her suffering feels like. Marcel's work on availability
   is used to point out how crucially important it is for the clinician to
   open herself to the suffering of the patient if she is to offer
   genuinely compassionate care. Availability requires a fundamental
   openness to the other that Marcel refers to as ``in-cohesion{''} or
   porosity. This is identified as an essential quality in the caring
   clinician. Marcel's approach to overcoming a lack of compassion is also
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many medical students are negatively disposed toward the
   elderly and chronic sick. The present study assessed the impact of a
   community-based teaching initiative, the Life History Project, on
   students' attitudes to these groups.
   Methods: A questionnaire including Likert based responses and free text
   comments was distributed to all first-year MBChB students after
   completion of their Life History coursework. Data was analysed using
   SPSS and content analysis.
   Results: A high proportion of students believed the Life History Project
   had increased their understanding of both psychological and social
   aspects of health and illness and the role of the humanistic social
   sciences within this. We discovered that the Life History Project not
   only gave students first-hand experience of the elderly and chronic sick
   but also had a positive effect on their attitudes towards these groups.
   The qualitative free text comments corroborated these views.
   Conclusions: It is possible to positively influence medical students'
   attitudes towards these stigmatised groups; it is therefore important
   that we continue to enhance opportunities for learning about the impact
   of chronic illness on individuals and society throughout the curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{Selection into GP speciality training is based on results of a
   multi-method job analysis study. Six key competency domains were
   identified as priorities to assess through the current national
   selection process, including empathy, communication, integrity, clinical
   expertise, problem-solving, and resilience. Each applicant is assessed
   using clinical problem-solving and situational judgement machine marked
   tests, followed by high fidelity exercises at regional selection
   centres. These show good internal reliability and predictive validity,
   with high correlations with subsequent job performance and outcomes in
   the MRCGP examinations. Candidate feedback is generally positive, where
   candidates prefer multiple opportunities to demonstrate their aptitude.
   When comparing selection methods, candidates perceive high fidelity
   assessments (for example, a consultation exercise with a simulated
   patient) as the most job relevant and fair. Emerging data provides
   opportunities to both streamline and re-engineer the process, so as to
   optimise efficiency (including cost-effectiveness) while further
   developing its robustness. Logistic considerations favour delivery of
   multiple equated versions of machine marked tests in invigilated test
   centres. As with other assessments in medical education, concerns remain
   about differential performance between UK and international medical
   graduates. There is an urgent need to review the job analysis and
   selection criteria given profound changes in UK general practice taking
   place over the last decade.}},
