Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In 2000 a diverse group of clinicians/educators at an
   inner-city safety-net hospital identified relational skills to reduce
   disparities at the point of care.
   DESCRIPTION: The resulting interviewing and precepting model helps build
   trust with patients as well as with learners. RESPECT adds attention to
   the relational dimension, addressing documented disparities in respect,
   empathy, power-sharing, and trust while incorporating prior
   cross-cultural models. Specific behavioral descriptions for each
   component make RESPECT a concrete, practical, integrated model for
   teaching patient care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Precepting with RESPECT fosters a safe climate for
   residents to partner with faculty, address challenges with patients at
   risk, and improve outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{To generate empathy in the care of vulnerable older persons requires
   care providers to reflect critically on their care practices. Ethics
   education and training must provide them with tools to accomplish such
   critical reflection. It must also create a pedagogical context in which
   good care can be taught and cultivated. The care-ethics lab `sTimul'
   originated in 2008 in Flanders with the stimulation of ethical
   reflection in care providers and care providers in training as its main
   goal. Also in 2008, sTimul commenced the organization of empathy
   sessions as an attempt to achieve this goal by simulation. The empathy
   session is a practical and fairly straightforward way of working to
   provoke care providers and care providers in training to engage in
   ethical reflection. Characteristic of the empathy session in the
   care-ethics lab is the emphasis on experience as a basis for ethical
   reflection.}},

Title = {{Identifying Barriers to Treatment Adherence and Related Attitudinal

Abstract = {{Introduction: The treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) is directed toward
   correction of organ dysfunction and relief of symptoms resulting from
   the disease. Lack of adherence to daily treatment regimens may have
   substantial short-term and long-term effects on patients with CF. In
   this study, we attempted to identify barriers to treatment adherence
   which could be predicted by objective measures and explore ways to
   improve adherence in adolescents with CF. Methods: A questionnaire was
   given to patients 12.0-20.9 years of age, designed with focus on
   specific barriers to adhering to treatment plan and related attitudinal
   patterns. Observational and analytical results were collected. Results:
   We obtained questionnaires and objective health data for 60 respondents.
   The most commonly identified barriers to adherence were forgetting or
   losing medications (32/60) and being too busy (23/60). Attitudinal
   patterns that played a significant role for nonadherence included
   unintentional forgetting (40/60), feeling that following CF treatments
   resulted in less freedom in their lives (30/60), and believing it is
   acceptable to miss a treatment every few days (18/60) or to miss
   treatments when busy (18/60). Discussion: There were a few statistically
   significant differences of adherence patterns between demographic
   subgroups in our study Males were more likely to agree that it is
   acceptable to miss doses if they are made up with extra doses later
   (24\% vs. 3\%, P=0.04). Patients who perceived themselves to be less
   healthy agreed more to statements of limited freedom, nonsympathetic
   medical providers, and difficulty adhering during times of decreased
   symptoms. This highlights an unexpected risk: as CF progresses and
   patients perceive themselves to be less healthy, they may become less
   likely to be adherent during the periods they are feeling the best,
   while at the same time becoming less likely to perceive empathy from
   their physicians. Conclusions: Survey results describe a variety of
   beliefs and attitudinal patterns which contribute to nonadherence in CF
   treatment, especially relating to time management. While patients
   largely understood the importance of treatments to their health,
   predictors of risky behaviors could lead to targeted interventions by CF
   centers to address these challenges and improve adherence. Pediatr

Title = {{Reports of the Decline of Empathy During Medical Education Are Greatly
   Exaggerated: A Reexamination of the Research}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Research is said to show that empathy declines during medical school and
   residency training. These studies and their results were examined to
   determine the extent of the decline and the plausibility of any
   alternative explanations.
   Method
   Eleven studies published from 2000 to 2008 which reported empathy at
   various stages of physician training were reexamined. Their results were
   transformed back to the original units of the rating scales to make
   results more interpretable by reporting them in the metric of the
   original anchors. Next, the relationship between empathy ratings and
   response rates were examined to see whether response bias was a
   plausible threat to the validity of the empathy decline conclusion.
   Results
   The changes in mean empathy ranged across the 11 studies from a
   0.1-point increase in empathy to a 0.5-point decrease, with an average
   of a 0.2-point decline for the 11 studies (ratings were on 5-point,
   7-point, and 9-point scales). Mean ratings were similar in medical
   school and residency. Response rates were low and-where
   reported-declined on average about 26 percentage points.
   Conclusions
   Reexamination revealed that the evidence does not warrant the strong,
   disturbing conclusion that empathy declines during medical education.
   Results show a very weak decline in mean ratings, and even the weak
   decline is questionable because of the low and varying response rates.
   Moreover, the empathy instruments are self-reports, and it isn't clear
   what they measure-or whether what they measure is indicative of
   patients' perceptions and the effectiveness of patient care. Acad Med.

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: The growing diversity of patient populations
   challenges health care providers. Physicians' attitudes and perceptions
   toward cultural diversity in health care could be partly contributing to
   difficulties in communication between physicians and ethnic minority
   patients. To evaluate these attitudes and perceptions, an instrument was
   developed and validated. Methods: A preliminary version of the
   instrument was developed through literature research and expert
   consultation and completed by 112 family physicians. Factor analysis was
   performed and reliability and construct validity tested. Results: The
   instrument revealed three factors that were interpreted as: (1)
   physicians' task perception and ideas on cultural differences in health
   and health care, (2) physicians' attitudes toward physician-patient
   communication with minority patients, and (3) physicians' perception of
   minority patients' needs in communication. Moderate but significant
   correlations were found between factors of the EMP-3 and practice
   organization, practice location, and physicians' gender. Several factors
   of the Jefferson Empathy Scale, the Patient Practitioner Orientation
   Scale, and the Health Beliefs and Attitude Scale related to the first
   two factors of the EMP-3. Conclusions: This instrument, designed
   specifically to measure physicians' attitudes toward cultural diversity,
   showed moderate validity and reliability results. Further adaptations
   and evaluation could be useful.}},

Abstract = {{While evidence-based medicine (EBM) is often accused on relying on a
   paradigm of `absolute truth', it is in fact highly consistent with Karl
   Popper's criterion of demarcation through falsification. Even more
   relevant, the first three steps of the EBM process are closely patterned
   on Popper's evolutionary approach of objective knowledge: (1)
   recognition of a problem; (2) generation of solutions; and (3) selection
   of the best solution. This places the step 1 of the EBM process
   (building an answerable question) in a pivotal position for the
   understanding of the whole process, and underscores a few aspects which
   are often overlooked in EBM courses. First in this step internal
   evidence (including personal expertise) must be appraised and integrated
   in the problem. Second, issues of applicability of the possible solution
   should be anticipated. Third, and possibly more important, the goal of
   the intervention should be set at this stage (typically by choosing the
   outcome in a PICO question). Depending whether or not goals depend on
   the goals of others, and whether they concern others' voluntary
   behaviour, goals may be classified as self-serving, moral, altruistic or
   moralistic. Thus, delicate ethical questions must be addressed at this
   stage, which means that patient preferences and values must be carefully
   sought, so that empathy, counselling and narrative medicine must be
   mastered to be able to formulate correctly an answerable question. The
   need to modify the current description of the EBM process to increase
   the recognition of implicit assumptions and increase the consistency of
   this model is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To examine how time pressure among nurses influences
   patient-perceived care quality.
   Background Although nurses worldwide face increased time pressure in the
   workplace, no studies have addressed how workplace time pressure
   influences patient-perceived care quality. Patient-perceived care
   quality predicts patient intent to revisit the hospital if care is
   required, warranting investigation as to whether nurse-perceived time
   pressure decreases patient-perceived care quality.
   Methods A cross-sectional design and survey method were adopted. The
   data analysis was based on 229 nurse-patient sets drawn from a medical
   centre in northern Taiwan. Each set comprised one nurse and three
   patients.
   Results The study results demonstrate that time pressure among nurses
   reduces patient-perceived reliability/accountability, responsiveness and
   assurance. The test results, however, did not indicate a significant
   negative association between time pressure and patient-perceived empathy
   and tangibles.
   Conclusion Time pressure among nurses may reduce patient perception of
   care quality in terms of reliability/accountability, responsiveness and
   assurance. Implications for nursing management To enhance patient
   perception of care quality, nursing managers need to devise means to
   reduce nurse-perceived time pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the service quality provided to heart surgery
   patients during their hospital stay, identifying the patient's
   expectations and perceptions. To associate service quality with: gender,
   age and the use of extracorporeal circulation.
   Methods: We studied 82 elective heart surgery patients (52.4\% females
   and 47.6\% males), operated by midsternal thoracotomy, age: 31 to 83
   years (60.4 +/- 13.2 years); period: March to September 2006. Service
   quality was evaluated in two instances: the expectations at
   pre-operative and the perceptions of the service received on the 6(th)
   post-operative; through the application of the modified SERVQUAL scale
   (SERVQUAL-Card). The result was obtained by the difference of the sum of
   the scores on perception minus those of the expectations, and through
   statistical analysis.
   Results: The SERVQUAL-Card scale was statistically validated, showing
   adequate level of internal consistency. We found a higher frequency of
   myocardial revascularization 55 (67.0\%); first heart surgery 72
   (87.8\%) and the use of ECC 69 (84.1\%). We noticed high mean values for
   expectations and perceptions with significant results (P<0.05). We
   observed a significant relationship between the quality of service with:
   gender, in empathy (P = 0.04) and age, in reliability (P = 0.02). There
   was no significant association between ECC and quality of service.
   Conclusion: Service quality was satisfactory. The patient demonstrated a
   high expectation to hospital medical service. Women present a higher
   perception of quality in empathy and younger people in reliability. The
   use of ECC is not related to service quality in this sample. The data
   obtained in this study suggest that the quality of this health service
   can be monitored through the periodical application of the SERVQUAL
   scale.}},

Title = {{Determinants of satisfaction with health care provider interactions at
   health centres in central Ethiopia: a cross sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: In primary health care, provider-patient interaction is
   fundamental platform and critically affects service delivery.
   Nevertheless, it is often ignored in medical research and practice and
   it is infrequently subjected to scientific inquiry, particularly in
   Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess patient satisfaction with health
   care provider interactions and its influencing factors among
   out-patients at health centers in West Shoa, Central Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross sectional facility based study was conducted on 768
   out-patients of six health centers in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia.
   The total sample size was allocated to each of the six health centers
   based on patient flow during the ten days prior to the start of data
   collection. Pre-tested instruments were used for data collection and the
   data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 statistical software. Factor
   score was computed for the items identified to represent the
   satisfaction scale by varimax rotation method. Using this regression
   factor score, multivariate linear regression analysis was performed and
   the effect of independent variables on the regression factor score was
   quantified.
   Results: Seventy three percent of the respondents perceived that
   provider's empathy was good and 35\% complained that providers were not
   technically competent enough. In addition, 82\% of the respondents rated
   non-verbal communication by the providers to be good, very good or
   excellent on a five-point ordinal scale. Regardless of the process, only
   34.1\% of the patients implied that the consultations made a difference
   in understanding their illness and coping with it. Generally speaking,
   62.6\% of the patients reported that they have been satisfied with their
   visit. Perceived empathy, perceived technical competency, non-verbal
   communication, patient enablement, being told the name of once illness,
   type and frequency of visit, knowing the providers and educational
   status were main independent predictors of patient satisfaction in this
   study. Furthermore, very good empathy (Beta = -4.323), fair non-verbal
   communication (Beta = -0.188), fewer expectations met (Beta = -0.169)
   and disagreement to technical competency (Beta = -0.156) had greater
   negative influence on patient satisfaction. On the other hand, excellent
   non-verbal communication (Beta = 0.114) and being told the name of once
   illness (0.109) had pronounced positive influence on patient
   satisfaction.
   Conclusion: The present study showed that interpersonal processes
   including perceived empathy, perceived technical competency, non-verbal
   communication and patient enablement significantly influence patient
   satisfaction. Therefore, health care providers should work towards
   improving the communication skill of their professionals along with
   having technically competent workers which could possibly affect the
   perception of the patient about all of the variables identified as
   independent predictors of patient satisfaction in this study.}},

Title = {{Patient involvement in assessing consultation quality: a quantitative
   study of the Patient Enablement Instrument in Poland}},
Journal = {{HEALTH EXPECTATIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Promoting a more patient-responsive service has been the focus of policy
   initiatives in newer EU states. One measure of success should be the
   patient's assessment of their consultation with their doctor.
   Objectives
   To measure consultation quality in Polish primary care using patient
   enablement (a patient-driven instrument developed in the UK) and to test
   its theoretical framework. To compare the patient enablement outcome of
   different types of doctor delivering primary care in Poland following
   reform.
   Design
   Cross-sectional quantitative questionnaire survey.
   Setting
   Random sample of primary care doctors practising within a 60-km radius
   of Gdansk, Poland.
   Subjects and outcome measures
   Patient Enablement Instrument and correlates were measured in 7924
   consecutive adult consultations of 48 doctors, stratified according to
   training: family medicine specialists (diploma holders), non-diplomates
   and general medicine doctors (polyclinic internists).
   Results
   Completion was high (78\%). The mean patient enablement score in Poland
   was 4.0 (SD 3.3) and mean consultation length was 10.3 min (SD 5.4 min).
   Consultation length and knowing the doctor are independently related to
   patient enablement in the Polish context. Variation between doctors is
   significant, but earlier differences in enablement between alternative
   providers have largely been ameliorated in practice.
   Conclusion
   It is feasible to use patient enablement on a large scale at routine
   consultation in primary care in Poland: acceptability was good in
   diverse environments. The internal consistency of enablement and its
   relationships broadly mirror those found in the UK. The effect of
   patient expectations shaped by social and cultural issues influencing
   enablement outcome requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Studies show that measures of physician and medical students'
   empathy decline with clinical training. Presently, there are limited
   data relating self-reported measures to observed behavior. This study
   explores a self-reported measure and observed empathy in medical
   students.
   METHOD: Students in the Class of 2009, at a university-based medical
   school, were surveyed at the end of their 2nd and 3rd year. Students
   completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version
   (JSPE-S), a self-administered scale, and were evaluated for demonstrated
   empathic behavior during Objective Structured Clinical Examinations
   (OSCEs).
   RESULTS: 97.6\% and 98.1\% of eligible students participated in their
   2nd and 3rd year, respectively. The overall correlation between the
   JSPE-S and OSCE empathy scores was 0.22, p < 0.0001. Students had higher
   self-reported JSPE-S scores in their 2nd year compared to their 3rd year
   (118.63 vs. 116.08, p < 0.0001), but had lower observed empathy scores
   (3.96 vs. 4.15, p < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Empathy measured by a self-administered scale decreased,
   whereas observed empathy increased among medical students with more
   medical training.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Mental problems such as stress, anxiety and depression have been
   described among medical students and are associated with poor academic
   and professional performance. It has been speculated that these problems
   impair students' quality of life (QoL). The authors aimed to assess the
   health-related QoL (HRQL) of medical students throughout their 6 years
   of training at a school with a traditional curriculum.
   Methods
   Of a total of 490 students attending our institution's medical school,
   38 were surveyed in February 2006 (incoming Year 1 group, surveyed when
   students were in the second week of Year 1 classes) and 352 were
   surveyed in February 2007 (students in Years 1-6). Students
   self-reported their HRQL and depressive symptoms using the Short-Form
   Health Survey (SF-36) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
   Comparisons were performed according to year in training, presence of
   depressive symptoms, gender, living arrangements and correlations with
   family income.
   Results
   The students' ages ranged from 18 to 31 years (median 22.3 years).
   Students in Years 2, 3, 4 and 6 had lower scores for mental and physical
   dimensions of HRQL compared with the incoming Year 1 group (P < 0.01),
   with the largest difference observed for Year 3 students. Students with
   depressive symptoms had lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 (P <
   0.01). Female students had lower HRQL scores than males (P < 0.01). No
   differences were observed for students living with versus without family
   and no correlation with family income was found.
   Conclusions
   Major impairments in HRQL were observed among Year 3 students, students
   with depressive symptoms and women. Medical schools should institute
   efforts to ensure that students' HRQL and emotional support are
   maintained, particularly during critical phases of medical training.}},

Title = {{An anatomy of conflicts in primary care encounters: a multi-method study}},
Journal = {{FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{93-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Medical consultations are replete with conflicts,
   particularly in the current era of explicit and implicit rationing
   practices in health care organizations. Although such conflicts may
   challenge the doctor-patient relationship, little is known about them or
   their consequences.
   Aims. To systematically describe the nature of doctor-patient conflicts
   in medical encounters and the strategies physicians use when faced with
   conflicts.
   Methods. Analysis of 291 videotaped routine encounters with 28 general
   practitioners, using a novel adaptation of the Roter interaction
   analysis system software, provided quantitative empirical data on the
   conflicts and on the communication process. Seven focus groups (56 GPs)
   provided qualitative insights and guided the analysis.
   Results. Conflicts were identified in 40\% of consultations; 21\% of
   these were related to the rationing of health care resources. In
   conflictual encounters, both the opening and closing phases of the
   encounter were shorter than in non-conflictual encounters. In coping
   with resource rationing, the commonest strategy was to accept the
   dictates of the system without telling the patients about other options.
   When conflict of this type occurred, doctors showed more opposition to
   the patients rather than empathy.
   Conclusions. Doctors often face conflicts in their routine work, but
   resource-related conflicts are especially difficult and expose the dual
   loyalties of the doctor to the patient and to the system. Insights
   derived from this research can be used to design training interventions
   that improve doctors' efficacy in coping with conflicts and ultimately
   allow them to provide better patient care.}},

Title = {{Development and preliminary psychometric properties of a well-being
   index for medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Psychological distress is common among medical students but
   manifests in a variety of forms. Currently, no brief, practical tool
   exists to simultaneously evaluate these domains of distress among
   medical students. The authors describe the development of a
   subject-reported assessment (Medical Student Well-Being Index, MSWBI)
   intended to screen for medical student distress across a variety of
   domains and examine its preliminary psychometric properties.
   Methods: Relevant domains of distress were identified, items generated,
   and a screening instrument formed using a process of literature review,
   nominal group technique, input from deans and medical students, and
   correlation analysis from previously administered assessments. Eleven
   experts judged the clarity, relevance, and representativeness of the
   items. A Content Validity Index (CVI) was calculated. Interrater
   agreement was assessed using pair-wise percent agreement adjusted for
   chance agreement. Data from 2248 medical students who completed the
   MSWBI along with validated full-length instruments assessing domains of
   interest was used to calculate reliability and explore internal
   structure validity.
   Results: Burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization),
   depression, mental quality of life (QOL), physical QOL, stress, and
   fatigue were domains identified for inclusion in the MSWBI. Six of 7
   items received item CVI-relevance and CVI-representativeness of >= 0.82.
   Overall scale CVI-relevance and CVI-representativeness was 0.94 and
   0.91. Overall pair-wise percent agreement between raters was >= 85\% for
   clarity, relevance, and representativeness. Cronbach's alpha was 0.68.
   Item by item percent pair-wise agreements and Phi were low, suggesting
   little overlap between items. The majority of MSWBI items had a >= 74\%

Title = {{Burnout and Serious Thoughts of Dropping Out of Medical School: A
   Multi-Institutional Study}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-102}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Little is known about students who seriously consider dropping out of
   medical school. The authors assessed the severity of thoughts of
   dropping out and explored the relationship of such thoughts with burnout
   and other indicators of distress.
   Method
   The authors surveyed medical students attending five medical schools in
   2006 and 2007 (prospective cohort) and included two additional medical
   schools in 2007 (cross-sectional cohort). The survey included questions
   about thoughts of dropping out, life events in the previous 12 months,
   and validated instruments evaluating burnout, depression symptoms, and
   quality of life (QOL).
   Results
   Data were provided by 858 (65\%) students in the prospective cohort and
   2,248 (52\%) in the cross-sectional cohort. Of 2,222 respondents, 243
   (11\%) indicated having serious thoughts of dropping out within the last
   year. Burnout (P < .0001), QOL (P < .003 each domain), and depressive
   symptoms (P < .0001) at baseline predicted serious thoughts of dropping
   out during the following year. Each one-point increase in emotional
   exhaustion and depersonalization score and one-point decrease in
   personal accomplishment score at baseline was associated with a 7\%
   increase in the odds of serious thoughts of dropping out during the
   following year. On subsequent confirmatory multivariable analysis, low
   scores for personal accomplishment, lower mental and physical QOL, and
   having children were independent predictors of students having serious
   thoughts of dropping out during the following year.
   Conclusions
   Approximately 11\% of students have serious thoughts of dropping out of
   medical school each year. Burnout seems to be associated with increased
   likelihood of serious thoughts of dropping out.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that student burnout and mental illness are increasing
   in U. S. medical schools. In response, students and administrators
   developed the Vanderbilt Medical Student (VMS) Wellness Program to
   promote student health and well-being through coordination of many new
   and existing resources. This program consists of three core components:
   The Advisory College Program, The Student Wellness Committee, and VMS
   LIVE. Each of the core components includes separate and unique
   individual programs, but each of these three components collaborates
   with the other two to accomplish the broad wellness goal of maximizing
   student health, happiness, and potential. The VMS Wellness Program has
   had early success with substantial growth and outstanding student buy-in
   since its inception in 2005. Preliminary data indicate that nearly every
   student has participated in at least two components of the VMS Wellness
   Program. In addition to participation, student response has been highly
   satisfactory, as evidenced by their positive feedback. The VMS Wellness
   Program is the first published model of a comprehensive medical student
   wellness initiative. The development and design of the program described
   in this article may serve as a framework for other institutions.}},

Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The authors recognize the pressing need for teaching methods that
   encourage empathy in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical
   curricula. While the useful application of theatrical acting techniques
   in medical education has been reported in major medical journals, these
   reports present an incomplete picture of these techniques and their
   potential importance to physician competence. The authors propose a
   broader understanding of performance theories and practices and a more
   nuanced appreciation of the experience and knowledge acquired through
   working with standardized patients and acting exercises. The academic
   discipline of performance studies offers a paradigm not only for
   teaching doctors how to ``act{''} in a more truly empathetic and
   compassionate manner but also for analyzing, and thus evaluating and
   improving, human interactions in the medical environment. A complex
   understanding of performance is essential to the development of an
   empathetic imagination, a cognitive faculty that allows physicians to
   generate unique responses to given situations rather than employing
   reactions learned by rote in ``communications training.{''} The authors
   recommend the inclusion of a wide range of performance theories and
   practices alongside the ubiquitous presence, in medical schools and
   other physician education forums, of actors performing as standardized
   patients. Acad Med. 2010; 85: 159-163.}},

Abstract = {{The gross anatomy dissection course is a cost-intensive piece of
   undergraduate medical education that students and professionals alike
   describe as very important within the overall medical curriculum. We
   sought to understand more explicitly students' valuation of gross
   anatomy as an ``important'' course and so developed a quantitative
   longitudinal questionnaire. Medical students (n = 124) enrolled in the
   winter term 2006/2007 gross anatomy course at the Ulm University Faculty
   of Medicine were surveyed anonymously prior to, in the middle of, and at
   the end of the dissection course. Subgroups of students expressing
   rising or falling opinions of course value were identified and
   correlated with student opinions about the course's ability to convey
   professional competencies. Five-point Likert scales were used for each
   survey item, which included such standardized instruments as the NeoFFI,
   BSI, and FBM. The study confirmed that medical students believe
   dissection to be valuable. Students indicated that participation in the
   course facilitated acquisition of anatomy knowledge as well as skills
   related to teamwork, coping with stress, and, to a lesser extent, time
   management. Students also noted that they developed less empathy than
   expected beforehand. Significant subgroup differences were observed
   relative to the competencies of teamwork, stress coping strategies, and
   empathy, as well as in students' stress levels associated with having to
   take a dissection course. Our study builds on previous work that has
   shown dissection courses help students develop professional
   competencies. The increase in professionalism might be a reason for the
   generally high value students place on the gross anatomy dissection
   course, Anat Sci Educ 3:3-11, 2010. (C) 2010 American Association of

Abstract = {{The dissection course (DC) is an essential part of the preclinical
   medical curriculum that mediates professionalism. The process of
   dissecting, however, has an inherent additional stress potential. Our
   study determined student mental stress, their need of psychological
   support and factors influencing this need. A quantitative longitudinal
   query before, during and after the DC was performed including the Brief
   Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as self-formulated questions used a
   5-point Likert scale. Half of the students who anticipated dissection to
   be a stress factor reported that this declined significantly over time.
   Instead, student fear of not being able to cope with the work load
   increased significantly. As many as 64\% of the students favored
   psychological support on the first course day, while 75\% rejected this
   during the period of dissection and 39\% appreciated this after the
   course. Moreover, 42\% emphasized the importance of the funeral
   ceremony. Additionally, 75\% documented their need for support in coping
   with stress and learning strategies. Gender, previous medical training,
   and BSI levels were identified as psychosocial influence factors. A
   majority of students named friends, members of their family or workmates
   as partners with whom they could talk about mental stress. Our results
   document the need to develop an optimum support during the DC taking
   into account the ascertained indicators. Exemplarily the Institute of
   Anatomy and Cell Biology at Ulm University suggests several options like
   a step by step approach for optimization. These measures reduce mental
   stress and help students to cope with it by the development of
   ``detached concern{''} towards their ``first patient{''} as this will
   decisively influence their future professional behavior. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of cancer are an understudied
   population with unique developmental and medical needs that extend well

   purpose of this study was to conduct interviews with AYA Latina cancer
   survivors to inform professionals working with these survivors. A
   hermeneutic phenomenological approach was selected based on the focus on
   experiences and meanings of Latino adolescents' cancer survivorship.
   Phenomenology allows for understanding the subjective meaning and lived
   experience of populations that are understudied or marginalized.
   In-depth interviews were conducted with participants. Enrolled in the
   study were Latino AYAs between the ages of 14 and 21 years, after
   treatment. Interviews revealed 7 themes regarding the experience and
   meaning of survivorship for this population: gratitude, humor/positive
   attitude, empathy for younger children with cancer, God and faith,
   cancer happens for a reason/cancer changed my life, familial support,
   and staff relationships. Latino AYA cancer survivors develop meaning out

Title = {{The introduction of medical humanities in the undergraduate curriculum
   of Greek medical schools: challenge and necessity}},
Journal = {{HIPPOKRATIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{241-243}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Medical humanities is a multidisciplinary field,
   consisting of humanities (theory of literature and arts, philosophy,
   ethics, history and theology), social sciences (anthropology, psychology
   and sociology) and arts (literature, theater, cinema, music and visual
   arts), integrated in the undergraduate curriculum of Medical schools.
   The aim of the present study is to discuss medical humanities and
   support the necessity of introduction of a medical humanities course in
   the curriculum of Greek medical schools.
   Materials, Methods and Results: Through the relevant Pub-Med search as
   well as taking into account various curricula of medical schools, it is
   evident that medical education today is characterized by acquisition of
   knowledge and skills and development of medical values and attitudes.
   Clinical observation with the recognition of key data and patterns in
   the collected information, is crucial in the final medical decision,
   i.e. in the complex process, through which doctors accumulate data,
   reach conclusions and decide on therapy. All sciences included in
   medical humanities are important for the high quality education of
   future doctors. The practice of Medicine is in large an image-related
   science. The history of anatomy and art are closely related, already
   from the Renaissance time. Studies have shown that attendance of courses
   on art critics improves the observational skills of medical students.
   Literature is the source of information about the nature and source of
   human emotions and behavior and of narratives of illness, and increases
   imagination. Philosophy aids in the development of analytical and
   synthetical thinking. Teaching of history of medicine develops humility
   and aids in avoiding the repetition of mistakes of the past, and quite
   often raises research and therapeutic skepticism. The comprehension of
   medical ethics and professional deontology guides the patient-doctor
   relationship, as well as the relations between physicians and their
   colleagues. The Medical Humanities course, which is already integrated
   in the undergraduate curriculum of many medical schools of Europe, USA
   and Australia, includes lectures by experts and students' presentations
   on the above-mentioned areas and could be offered, for a semester,
   during the first years.
   Conclusion: The aim of Medical Humanities course is the development of
   imagination and interpretation of data through analytical complex
   procedures, the development of skills of close observation and careful
   interpretation of the patient ``language{''} and the enhancement of
   empathy for the patients, as well as the development of the
   physician-patient relationship and finally the
   conceptualization/construction of personal and professional values.

Title = {{Impact of Resident Well-Being and Empathy on Assessments of Faculty
   Physicians}},

Abstract = {{Teaching effectiveness is an important criterion for promoting
   clinician-educators. However, the relationship between residents'
   psychological characteristics and their assessments of faculty
   physicians is unknown.
   To determine whether residents' well-being and empathy influenced their
   assessments of faculty physicians.
   We studied 1,191 assessments of 356 faculty physicians by 209 internal
   medicine residents at a large academic medical center from 2007 to 2008.
   A repeated measures design with multivariate generalized estimating
   equations was used to evaluate associations between resident well-being
   and empathy, and residents' assessments of faculty.
   Resident surveys included standardized measures of quality of life,
   burnout, depression, and empathy. Residents assessed faculty members'
   teaching performance with a validated 16-item instrument.
   149 residents (71\%) provided well-being, empathy, and assessment data.
   In multivariate models, faculty assessments from the previous year were
   the strongest predictor of current resident-of-faculty assessment
   scores. Residents' Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) scores
   were also associated with faculty assessments (beta = 0.0063, 95\% CI =
   0.0018-0.0108; p = .0061). On this 140-point, 20-item scale, a 10-point
   increase in empathy correlated with a 0.063-point increase in residents'
   assessments of faculty on a 5-point scale. There were no significant
   associations between residents' assessments of faculty and quality of
   life, burnout, or depression.
   This study demonstrates that residents' well-being does not influence
   their assessments of faculty physicians, thus supporting the
   trustworthiness of these assessments as a criterion for promoting
   clinician-educators. However, the association between residents' empathy
   and resident-of-faculty assessments suggests that faculty assessments
   may be modestly influenced by residents' intrinsic characteristics.}},

Title = {{Empathy development in medical education - A critical review}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{593-600}},
Abstract = {{Physicians' empathy is generally regarded as important and attempts are
   made to foster empathy. However, research indicates that the medical
   students' empathy is often stunted during medical education, and our
   understanding of how empathy is modulated during medical education is
   limited. This critical review explores some relatively-neglected
   challenges in the literature on empathy development in medical
   education. There is a lack of adequate attention to physicians'
   disciplinary matrix, the medico-scientific formation of physicians is
   often neglected, the dichotomy between the science and the humanities
   lives on and the `soft' side is often presented as an appendix. This may
   contribute to sustain a double-blinded, dichotomized clinical gaze - a
   clinical gaze that tends to separate biomedical aspects from human
   experience and understanding and to neglect existential aspects of both
   the physician and the patient. Empathy training and the humanities
   should not be situated outside the hard core of medicine, but rather
   foster critical discussions of the limits and strengths of biomedical
   paradigms throughout medicine. In this way, the gap between biomedicine
   and the humanities could be bridged, and empathy training could
   contribute both in developing physicians' general clinical perception
   and judgement and in preventing the widespread stunting of empathy.}},

Title = {{Stability of values during medical school}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{779-781}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical students' values represent an understudied area of
   research in medical education research. No known studies have
   investigated how medical students' values change over time from
   matriculation to graduation.
   Aim: Values are thought to remain relatively stable over the life
   course. However, little research supports this claim. Therefore, we
   examined the extent to which values change or remain the same during
   medical school.
   Method: Forty-six first-year medical students completed the Physician
   Values in Practice Scale (PVIPS) during their first and fourth years of
   medical school. The PVIPS contains 38 statements of values about medical
   practice and comprises six scales: Prestige, Service, Autonomy,
   Lifestyle, Management, and Scholarly Pursuits.
   Results: Matched pair t-tests (p<0.05) indicated significant differences
   between students' PVIPS scores pretest (first year of medical school)
   and posttest (fourth year of medical school) for 2 of the 6 values
   (Autonomy: t(45) = -4.12, p<0.001 and Lifestyle: t(45) = -2.62, p =
   0.012).
   Conclusions: Medical students values appear to change slightly during
   their 4 years of medical education. In line with literature suggesting
   that the medical education process is associated with change in certain
   student qualities and attributes (e. g., empathy), physician values may
   be another variable so affected.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{E471-E478}},
Abstract = {{Background: It has been well documented that effective empathic
   communication in the context of patient care is associated with improved
   health care outcomes. However, the emphasis given to empathy in medical
   education in Iran is limited, and the state of such teaching is unknown
   in many countries.
   Aims: To determine the psychometric properties of an Iranian translation
   of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) among medical
   students, and to examine the differences on mean empathy scores by
   gender and the different years of medical school.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students.
   Data analysis was based on 181 questionnaires. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation was used to identify the number and
   composition of components constituting the developed constructs.
   Results: The PCA yielded three factors: Compassionate care,
   perspective-taking, and the ability to walk in the patient's shoes. No
   statistically significant differences in the empathy means scores were
   found by gender and the different years of medical school.
   Conclusions: The Persian version of JSPE is a psychometrically sound
   instrument to measure empathy. Cultural backgrounds and pedagogical
   practice may influence medical students' attitudes towards empathy. Some
   recommendations are made, and the study limitations are discussed.}},

   general physicians completed the JSPE. The associations of empathy
   scores with demographic characteristics and practice-related variables

   Results: The scale showed an acceptable internal consistency
   (alpha=0.78). Three of six extracted factors were considered as
   prominent based on the scree test, which were similar to those obtained
   in the US samples. Women scored higher than men. Empathy improved with
   increasing practice experiences. Other practice-related variables did

   Conclusions: Results support the construct and criterion-related

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E42-E48}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) may be related to student
   characteristics (such as conscientiousness and empathy), and performance
   at medical school, although few studies have so far been conducted.
   Aim: To investigate the association of EI with students' age, sex,
   ethnicity and stage of study at a London medical school.
   Methods: All medical students were invited to complete an online EI
   instrument, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
   (MSCEIT) version 2, a 141-item measure of the ability to perceive, use,
   understand and manage emotions. An additional questionnaire to gather
   demographic data was linked to the MSCEIT.
   Results: We analysed 263 responses from a population of 2114 medical
   students after three reminders (12.3\% response rate). Aggregated EI
   scores were similar through the curriculum. Age, sex and ethnicity
   explained 9.2\% of the variance in aggregated EI scores. In terms of
   managing emotions, 6.7\% of the variance was explained by the stage of
   study, with significantly higher scores for students in their final year
   compared to those in the first two years.
   Conclusion: This exploratory study provides preliminary data on EI
   scores for UK medical students identifies factors associated with higher
   and lower scores and suggests that aggregated EI scores remain stable

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{E178-E184}},
Abstract = {{Aim: At Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University (Alpert Med), a
   narrative medicine curriculum innovation of students' reflective writing
   (field notes) with individualized feedback from an interdisciplinary
   faculty team (in pre-clinical years) has been implemented in a Doctoring
   course to cultivate reflective capacity, empathy, and humanism.
   Interactive reflective writing (student writer/faculty feedback provider
   dyad), we propose, can additionally support students with rites of
   passage at critical educational junctures.
   Method: At Alpert Med, we have devised a tool to guide faculty in
   crafting quality feedback, i.e. the Brown Educational Guide to Analysis
   of Narrative (BEGAN) which includes identifying students' salient
   quotes, utilizing reflection-inviting questions and close reading,
   highlighting derived lessons/key concepts, extracting clinical patterns,
   and providing concrete recommendations as relevant.
   Results: We provide an example of a student's narrative describing an
   emotionally powerful and meaningful event - the loss of his first
   patient - and faculty responses using BEGAN.
   Conclusion: The provision of quality feedback to students' reflective
   writing - supported by BEGAN - can facilitate the transformation of
   student to professional through reflection within medical education.}},

   communication and relational difficulties.
   Objective. The objective of the study was to elicit providers'
   perspectives on their experiences in caring for patients with chronic
   pain.
   Design. The design used was a qualitative study using open-ended,
   in-depth interviews.
   Participants. Twenty providers (10 men, 10 women) from five different
   clinics were interviewed at the Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical
   Center.
   Results. Three broad themes emerged from the analysis: 1) providers
   emphasized the importance of the patient-provider relationship,
   asserting that productive relationships with patients are essential for
   good pain care; 2) providers detailed difficulties they encounter when
   caring for patients with chronic pain, including feeling pressured to
   treat with opioids, believability of patients' reports of pain, worries
   about secondary gain/diversion, and ``abusive{''} or ``difficult{''}
   patients; and 3) providers described the emotional toll they sometimes
   felt with chronic pain care, including feeling frustrated, ungratified,
   and guilty.
   Findings. Findings were interpreted within a model of patient-centered
   care.
   Conclusions. The clinical implications of these findings are two-fold.
   First, PCPs' needs cannot be ignored when considering pain care. PCPs
   need support, both instrumental and emotional, as they care for patients
   with chronic pain. Second, improving PCPs' patient-centered
   communication skills including demonstrating empathy and encouraging
   shared decision-making holds promise for alleviating some of the strain
   and burden reported by providers, ultimately leading to improved patient
   care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inadequate physician training may be a barrier to
   physician-patient discussions of advance directives (ADs). Description:
   The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an ADs course,
   which includes completing a directive, on medical students' perceived
   knowledge of and preparedness for discussing ADs with patients. All
   4th-year medical students completed a 10-hr bioethics course comprising
   interactive lecture and small-group discussion formats. Curriculum
   content included ethical and legal aspects of ADs. An 8-item survey with
   free-text entry was administered 1 month after course completion.
   Internal consistency reliability of survey scores was determined. Two
   authors independently coded the free-text comments and reached consensus
   on underlying themes. Evaluation: Of the 89 students who completed the
   survey (response rate 80\%), 87 (98\%) felt more knowledgeable and 88
   (99\%) better equipped to counsel patients about ADs. Forty-two (47\%)
   reported they had counseled others to complete ADs during the month
   after the course. Internal consistency reliability of survey scores was
   very good (Cronbach's =.78). Dominant themes of responses to the
   question, oWhat was the most eye opening, troubling, or difficult aspect
   about filling out your advance directive?o included difficulties
   articulating wishes, legal language, selecting a surrogate, and facing
   mortality. Conclusions: These findings suggest an ADs course that
   includes completing a directive enhances medical students' empathy for
   and preparedness to discuss ADs with patients.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the meaning of empathy and how it influences
   clinicians in their personal and professional lives. Empathy may benefit
   Client and clinician by improving patient satisfaction and pain
   management, reducing medical errors, and helping to keep clinicians
   grounded in the priorities of patient care. The cultural and
   developmental origins and neural basis of empathy are reviewed to
   provide insight into how a clinician's and client's emotions can
   interact and influence each other. Methods for cultivating and
   communicating empathetic responses in the clinical setting are provided,
   including ways of identifying and dealing with difficult clients.
   Concepts such as attunement, emotional labor, and parallel emotions are
   explained. The limitations to empathy and potential challenges or
   difficulties for the clinician are also explored, along with possible
   solutions. Narratives from the author's personal and professional life
   are included to illustrate how a clinician's emotions can play a
   significant part in interactions with clients. This discussion shows
   that clinicians must combine both evidenced-based practice and empathy
   in their interactions with clients to achieve the professional goal of
   high-quality care.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Since the Winter Term 2008/2009 the Medical School of the
   University of Muenster, Germany, has used standardized patients in the
   clinical course ``Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy{''} with
   fourth-year undergraduate students performing bio-psycho-social
   anamnesis on these standardized patients. We wanted to evaluate the
   influence of the course on students' empathy.
   Methods: A total of 107 students participated in the standardized
   patient program during the Winter Term 2009/2010, with 90 (84.1 \%)
   completing the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy before and after the
   course. In addition, we conducted a standard evaluation of the medical
   faculty.
   Results: The pre-post comparison revealed a significant increase in
   empathy (d = 0.331, p = .001). The standard evaluation yielded a high
   satisfaction among the course participants, though several students did
   assess the course critically.
   Conclusion: The implementation of a standardized patient program in
   psychosomatics and psychotherapy proved to be of value, since it
   increased students' empathy and received a positive evaluation. To
   prevent the students from being humiliated, it is of particular
   importance to implement a gentle and tactful feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lectures supported by theatrical performance may enhance
   learning and be an attractive alternative to traditional lectures. This
   study describes our experience with using theatre in education for
   medical students since 2001.
   Methods: The volunteer students, coached by experienced students, were
   given a two-week preparation period to write and prepare different
   dramatized headache scenarios during three supervised meetings. A
   theatrical performance was followed by a student presentation about
   history taking and clinical findings in diagnosing headache. Finally, a
   group discussion led by students dealt with issues raised in the
   performance. The evaluation of the theatre in education lecture ``A
   Primary Care Approach to Headache{''} was based on feedback from
   students.
   Results: More than 90\% of 43 responding students fully agreed with the
   statement ``Theatrical performance made it easier to understand the
   topic{''}. More than 90\% disagreed with the statements ``Lecture halls
   were not appropriate for this kind of interaction{''} and ``Students as
   teachers were not appropriate{''}. Open-ended questions showed that the
   lesson was thought of as fun, good and useful by most students. The
   headache questions in the final exam showed results that were similar to
   average exam results for other questions.
   Conclusion: Using theatrical performance in medical education was
   appreciated by most students and may facilitate learning and enhance
   empathy and team work communication skills.}},

Title = {{Skills of Internal Medicine Residents in Disclosing Medical Errors: A
   Study Using Standardized Patients}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1803-1808}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To determine internal medicine (IM) residents' ability to disclose a
   medical error using standardized patients (SPs) and to survey residents'
   experiences of disclosure.
   Method
   In 2005, 42 second-year IM residents at the University of Toronto
   participated in the study. Each resident disclosed one medical error
   (insulin overdose) to an SP. The SP and a physician observer scored
   performance using a rating scale (1 = not performed, 2 = performed
   somewhat, and 3 = performed well) that measures error disclosure on five
   specific component skills and that provides an overall assessment score
   (scored on a five-point scale, 5 = high). Residents also completed a
   questionnaire.
   Results
   The mean scores on the five components were explanation of medical facts
   (2.60), honesty (2.31), empathy (2.47), future error prevention (1.99),
   and general communication skills (2.47). The residents' mean overall
   disclosure score was 3.53. Although 27 of 42 residents (64\%) reported
   previous experience in disclosing an error to a patient during their
   training, only 7 (27\%) of these residents reported receiving any
   feedback about their performance. Of 41 residents, 21 (51\%) had
   received some prior training in disclosure, and 38 (93\%) thought
   additional training would be useful and relevant.
   Conclusions
   Disclosing medical error is now a standard practice. Experience with
   medical error begins early in training, and preparing trainees to
   discuss these errors is essential. Areas exist for improvement in
   residents' disclosure abilities, particularly regarding the prevention
   of future errors. Curricula to increase residents' skills and comfort in
   disclosure need to be implemented. Most residents would welcome further
   training.}},

   specialized coding software.
   Results: Anesthesiologists and parents engaged in higher rates of most
   behaviors than nurses. Overall, adult emotion-focused behavior such as
   empathy and reassurance was significantly positively related to
   children's distress and negatively related to children's coping
   behaviors. Adult distracting behavior such as humor and distracting talk
   showed the opposite pattern. Medical reinterpretation by
   anesthesiologists was significantly positively related to children's
   coping behaviors, but the same behavior by parents was significantly
   positively related to children's distress.
   Conclusions: The data presented here provide evidence for a relation
   between adult behaviors and children's distress and coping at anesthesia
   induction. These behaviors are trainable, and hence it is possible to
   test whether modifying physician behavior can influence child behavior
   in future studies.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{569-577}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Skilled physician-family communication in the ICU has been shown to
   improve patient outcomes, but until now little attention has been given
   to the effect of communication on family satisfaction and bereavement
   outcomes. The aim of this review is to outline the recent evidence that
   effective physician communication with families, and proactive
   palliative care interventions can improve outcomes for both patients and
   family, members in the ICU.
   Recent findings
   New data from the ICU correlates physician ability to identify and
   respond to emotion and to effectively share prognostic information with
   improved outcomes. Furthermore, proactive palliative care interventions
   that promote family meetings, use of empathic communication skills, and
   targeted palliative care consultations can improve family satisfaction,
   reduce length of stay in the ICU and reduce adverse family bereavement
   outcomes.
   Summary
   Empathic communication, skilful discussion of prognosis, and effective
   shared decision-making are core elements of quality care in the ICU,
   represent basic competencies for the ICU physician, and should be
   emphasized in future educational and clinical interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Burnout has negative effects on work performance and patient care. The
   current standard for burnout assessment is the Maslach Burnout Inventory
   (MBI), a well-validated instrument consisting of 22 items answered on a
   7-point Likert scale. However, the length of the MBI can limit its
   utility in physician surveys.
   To evaluate the performance of two questions relative to the full MBI
   for measuring burnout.
   Cross-sectional data from 2,248 medical students, 333 internal medicine
   residents, 465 internal medicine faculty, and 7,905 practicing surgeons.
   The single questions with the highest factor loading on the emotional
   exhaustion (EE) ({''}I feel burned out from my work{''}) and
   depersonalization (DP) ({''}I have become more callous toward people
   since I took this job{''}) domains of burnout were evaluated in four
   large samples of medical students, internal medicine residents, internal
   medicine faculty, and practicing surgeons. Spearman correlations between
   the single EE question and the full EE domain score minus that question
   ranged from 0.76-0.83. Spearman correlations between the single DP
   question and the full DP domain score minus that question ranged from
   0.61-0.72. Responses to the single item measures of emotional exhaustion
   and depersonalization stratified risk of high burnout in the relevant
   domain on the full MBI, with consistent patterns across the four sampled
   groups.
   Single item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization
   provide meaningful information on burnout in medical professionals.}},

Title = {{Elements of effective communication-Rediscoveries from homeopathy}},
Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{172-178}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Patients are increasingly attracted to homeopathy despite the
   unproven effectiveness of homeopathic remedies. Clinical benefit of
   homeopathy may be due to communication. This review aims to identify and
   assess effective communication patterns in homeopathy.
   Methods: Narrative review and synthesis of published communication
   patterns, patient narratives and the author's professional experience as
   a homeopathic practitioner.
   Results: In the biomedical model, where the focus is on disease,
   communication is physician-centered with early redirection of patients'
   concerns, and associated with reduced compliance increasing risk of,
   malpractice claims and low professional fulfillment. The biopsychosocial
   and the developing integrative medicine models are based on biomedicine
   but aim to include the whole person. Patient-centeredness is a behavior
   that elicits, respects and incorporates patients' wishes, allows active
   patient participation and is related to improved outcomes. The
   homeopathic model is based on holism and comprehension of the totality
   of the patient and uses patient-centered communication with a high
   degree of physician cooperation, empathy, hopefulness, enablement and
   narrative competence, all of which can improve outcomes.
   Conclusion: Both biopsychosocial and homeopathic models rely on
   patient-centered communication. Regardless of conceptual differences,
   they overlap in their common respect for the totality and individuality
   of the patient. The study of the homeopathic model shows that respect
   for the whole person is a basic requirement to entrench
   patient-centeredness more firmly in medicine.
   Practice implications: Medical education should include values such as
   individual coping strategies, the benefits of a sound and healthy
   life-style and the necessity of hope and enablement. Health care should
   be redesigned to honor physicians who practice these values. (c) 2009

Abstract = {{People with mental illness around the world continue to suffer from
   stigmatization and limited care. Previous studies utilizing self-report
   questionnaires indicate that many medical students regard clinical work
   with psychiatric patients as unappealing, while the professionalism
   literature has documented a general decline in students' capacity for
   empathy over the course of medical school. Through in-depth interviews,
   this study attempts to better understand the formation of medical
   students' perceptions of psychiatry and the implications of that process
   for a more general understanding of the impact of emotionally-laden
   experiences on medical students' capacity for empathy. Forty-seven
   fourth-year medical students who had expressed interest or performed
   well in psychiatry were asked a series of questions to elicit their
   perceptions of the field of psychiatry. Interview transcripts were
   systematically coded using content analysis and principles of grounded
   theory. Stigma, stereotypes, and stressfully intense emotional reactions
   seemed to adversely affect the students' expected satisfaction from and
   willingness to care for the mentally ill, despite enjoying psychiatry's
   intellectual content and the opportunity to develop in-depth
   relationships with patients. Teaching faculty need to directly address
   the stigma and stereotypes that surround mental illness and actively
   help medical students cope with the stress that they report experiencing
   during their psychiatry clerkship in order to improve the recognition
   and treatment of psychiatric illness by newly graduating physicians.
   More generally, the relationships that we identify among stress,
   stigmatization, and stereotyping along an empathic spectrum suggest that
   increased attention should be paid to the stress that empathy can
   entail. This perspective may allow for the creation of similarly
   targeted interventions throughout the medical school curriculum to
   counteract the decline in empathy, the so-called ``hardening of the
   heart,{''} associated with physician-training worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Context Primary care physicians report high levels of distress, which is
   linked to burnout, attrition, and poorer quality of care. Programs to
   reduce burnout before it results in impairment are rare; data on these
   programs are scarce.
   Objective To determine whether an intensive educational program in
   mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness is associated with
   improvement in primary care physicians' well-being, psychological
   distress, burnout, and capacity for relating to patients.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Before-and-after study of 70 primary
   care physicians in Rochester, New York, in a continuing medical
   education (CME) course in 2007-2008. The course included mindfulness
   meditation, self-awareness exercises, narratives about meaningful
   clinical experiences, appreciative interviews, didactic material, and
   discussion. An 8-week intensive phase (2.5 h/wk, 7-hour retreat) was
   followed by a 10-month maintenance phase (2.5 h/mo).
   Main Outcome Measures Mindfulness (2 subscales), burnout (3 subscales),
   empathy (3 subscales), psychosocial orientation, personality (5
   factors), and mood (6 subscales) measured at baseline and at 2, 12, and
   15 months.
   Results Over the course of the program and follow-up, participants
   demonstrated improvements in mindfulness (raw score, 45.2 to 54.1; raw
   score change {[}Delta], 8.9; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 7.0 to
   10.8); burnout (emotional exhaustion, 26.8 to 20.0; Delta = -6.8; 95\%
   CI, -4.8 to -8.8; depersonalization, 8.4 to 5.9; Delta = -2.5; 95\% CI,
   -1.4 to -3.6; and personal accomplishment, 40.2 to 42.6; Delta = 2.4;
   95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.6); empathy (116.6 to 121.2; Delta = 4.6; 95\% CI, 2.2
   to 7.0); physician belief scale (76.7 to 72.6; Delta = -4.1; 95\% CI,
   -1.8 to -6.4); total mood disturbance (33.2 to 16.1; Delta = -17.1; 95\%
   CI, -11 to -23.2), and personality (conscientiousness, 6.5 to 6.8; Delta
   = 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 5 and emotional stability, 6.1 to 6.6; Delta =
   0.5; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 0.7). Improvements in mindfulness were correlated
   with improvements in total mood disturbance (r = -0.39, P < .001),
   perspective taking subscale of physician empathy (r = 0.31, P < .001),
   burnout (emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment subscales, r =
   -0.32 and 0.33, respectively; P < .001), and personality factors
   (conscientiousness and emotional stability, r = 0.29 and 0.25,
   respectively; P < .001).
   Conclusions Participation in a mindful communication program was
   associated with short-term and sustained improvements in well-being and
   attitudes associated with patient-center care. Because before-and-after
   designs limit inferences about intervention effects, these findings
   warrant randomized trials involving a variety of practicing physicians.

Abstract = {{Context Fatigue and distress have been separately shown to be associated
   with medical errors. The contribution of each factor when assessed
   simultaneously is unknown.
   Objective To determine the association of fatigue and distress with
   self-perceived major medical errors among resident physicians using
   validated metrics.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective longitudinal cohort study
   of categorical and preliminary internal medicine residents at Mayo
   Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Data were provided by 380 of 430 eligible
   residents (88.3\%). Participants began training from 2003 to 2008 and
   completed surveys quarterly through February 2009. Surveys included
   self-assessment of medical errors, linear analog self-assessment of
   overall quality of life (QOL) and fatigue, the Maslach Burnout
   Inventory, the PRIME-MD depression screening instrument, and the Epworth
   Sleepiness Scale.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of self-perceived, self-defined major
   medical errors was recorded. Associations of fatigue, QOL, burnout, and
   symptoms of depression with a subsequently reported major medical error
   were determined using generalized estimating equations for repeated
   measures.
   Results The mean response rate to individual surveys was 67.5\%. Of the
   356 participants providing error data (93.7\%), 139 (39\%) reported
   making at least 1 major medical error during the study period. In
   univariate analyses, there was an association of subsequent
   self-reported error with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.10 per unit increase; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.03-1.16; P = .002) and fatigue score (OR, 1.14 per unit increase; 95\%
   CI, 1.08-1.21; P < .001). Subsequent error was also associated with
   burnout (ORs per 1-unit change: depersonalization OR, 1.09; 95\% CI,
   1.05-1.12; P < .001; emotional exhaustion OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.08;
   P < .001; lower personal accomplishment OR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.92-0.97; P
   < .001), a positive depression screen (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.76-3.72; P <
   .001), and overall QOL (OR, 0.84 per unit increase; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.91;
   P < .001). Fatigue and distress variables remained statistically
   significant when modeled together with little change in the point
   estimates of effect. Sleepiness and distress, when modeled together,
   showed little change in point estimates of effect, but sleepiness no
   longer had a statistically significant association with errors when
   adjusted for burnout or depression.
   Conclusion Among internal medicine residents, higher levels of fatigue
   and distress are independently associated with self-perceived medical
   errors. JAMA. 2009;302(12):1294-1300}},

Abstract = {{Preserving and promoting empathy are ethical imperatives in medical
   education. The authors of this commentary propose that the ``hidden
   curriculum{''} and mixed messages learners frequently receive during
   clinical rotations may erode humanistic traits essential to high-quality
   care. Three articles in this issue focus on assessing attitude towards
   empathy in the health care setting using the Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy. The authors discuss salient points from these
   reports, reinforce the concept of empathy as a cognitive attribute, and
   offer recommendations for teaching and nurturing empathy in health
   professionals. In the reports, construct validity and reliability of the
   instrument were confirmed and were comparable with previous results,
   thus providing medical educators with a sound instrument to measure
   empathic attitudes in the context of patient care. The authors agree
   with the distinctions made in the three studies between empathy
   (described as a cognitive attribute) and sympathy (described as an
   emotional attribute) and believe that empathy as a cognitive skill can
   be role modeled, taught, and assessed. Barriers to empathic practice
   (lack of sufficient role models, failing to teach empathy as a cognitive
   skill, negative experiences, time pressures, overreliance on technology)
   can be remedied in medical education through interprofessional education
   and practice and institutional promotion of relationship-centered care,
   which maintains the centrality of the patient-clinician relationship
   while recognizing the importance of relationships with self and others.}},
