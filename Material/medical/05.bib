Abstract = {{Providing support and talking to the relatives of organ donors is one of
   the most difficult tasks in an intensive care unit. The quality of this
   task, especially the quality of the conversation, can be significantly
   improved by exact and timely preparation as well as by the creation of
   the respective framework conditions and training in the area of
   communication.
   The exact preparation includes knowledge about the patient and their
   relatives, their cultural and religious background, medical data, and
   the findings of examinations. An important aspect is the knowledge and
   the consideration of ethical differences in different cultures as well
   as overcoming language barriers with the help of an interpreter. Team
   meetings with the treating intensive care physician, the nursing staff,
   and the transplant coordinator ensure that all questions on the topic
   brain death and organ donation can be answered satisfactorily. At the
   beginning of the conversation, the uncomfortable news should be
   delivered. Only after the relatives have accepted the news about the
   death which can be recognized by their verbal and non-verbal statements
   should the doctor turn the conversation to organ donation.
   In the conversation, openness, empathy, authenticity, emotional support
   as well as friendly/attentive conversation technique are important.
   Communication skills can be improved through seminars and regular
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Medical school curricula intended to promote empathy varies
   widely. Even the most effective curricula leave a significant group of
   students untouched. Pre-existing student factors influence their
   response to learning experiences. We examined the individual predictors
   of first semester medical students' attitudes toward the value of
   physician empathy in clinical encounters.
   Methods: First year students (n = 4732) attending a stratified random
   sample of 49 US medical schools completed an online questionnaire that
   included measures of dispositional characteristics, attitudes and
   beliefs, self-concept and well-being.
   Results: Discomfort with uncertainty, close-mindedness, dispositional
   empathy, elitism, medical authoritarianism, egalitarianism, self-concept
   and well-being all independently predicted first year medical students'
   attitudes toward the benefit of physician empathy in clinical
   encounters.
   Conclusion: Students vary on their attitude toward the value of
   physician empathy when they start medical school. The individual factors
   that predict their attitudes toward empathy may also influence their
   response to curricula promoting empathic care.
   Practice implications: Curricula in medical school promoting empathic
   care may be more universally effective if students' preexisting
   attitudes are taken into account. Messages about the importance of
   physician empathy may need to be framed in ways that are consistent with
   the beliefs and prior world-views of medical students. (C) 2014

Title = {{Attitudes and Habits of Highly Humanistic Physicians}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1252-1258}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Humanism is fundamental to excellent patient care and is therefore an
   essential concept for physicians to teach to learners. However, the
   factors that help attending physicians to maintain their own humanistic
   attitudes over time are not well understood. The authors attempted to
   identify attitudes and habits that highly humanistic physicians perceive
   allow them to sustain their humanistic approach to patient care.
   Method
   In 2011, the authors polled internal medicine residents at the
   University of Pennsylvania to identify attending physicians who
   exemplified humanistic patient care. In this cross-sectional,
   qualitative study, the authors used a semistructured script to interview
   the identified attending physicians to determine attitudes and habits
   that they believed contribute to their sustenance of humanistic patient
   care.
   Results
   Attitudes for sustaining humanism in this cohort of humanistic
   physicians included humility, curiosity, and a desire to live up to a
   standard of behavior. Many of the physicians deliberately worked at
   maintaining their humanistic attitudes. Habits that humanistic
   physicians engaged in to sustain their humanism included
   self-reflection, connecting with patients, teaching and role modeling,
   and achieving work-life balance. Physicians believed that treating their
   patients humanistically serves to prevent burnout in themselves.
   Conclusions
   Identification of factors that highly humanistic attending physicians
   perceive help them to sustain a humanistic outlook over time may inform
   the design of programs to develop and sustain humanism in teaching
   faculty.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Teaching healthcare providers (HCPs) effective communication
   skills can be challenging, but is crucial for managing complex patient
   encounters.
   Aim: To provide medical trainees strategies for recognizing and
   understanding problematic interactions.
   Methods: The Twelve Tips are based on a study of communication skills
   teaching with family medicine trainees (n = 26) who received controlled
   exposure to common clinical difficulties simulated by standardized
   patients (SPs). The following tips were derived from a thematic analysis
   of a subset of the transcribed coaching sessions.
   Results: These tips demonstrate that doctor-patient communication
   difficulties can arise from any of three sources: the patient's issues,
   the HCP's misunderstanding or inaccurate responsiveness to an issue,
   and/or the interaction between the HCP and the patient. These tips are
   heuristically grouped into two themes: (1) guiding principles to hold in
   mind and (2) behaviors that can be used to apply these principles.
   Conclusion: We believe that these strategies will help trainees to
   remain attentive to the patient, the interaction, and their own
   reactions, to improve the overall clinical encounter.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this exploratory study was to examine how the working
   conditions and job stress of private practice oncologists (PPOs) affect
   their interaction with patients. Data for the study were collected
   through semi-structured interviews with PPOs selected based on
   purposeful sampling criteria. The data were evaluated using content
   analysis. Factors perceived by PPOs to influence their level of stress
   and patient care were some of their own personal characteristics as well
   as working conditions both within and outside their practices. Apart
   from being able to name specific stressors (e. g. dysfunctional
   organisational workflow and interruptions during medical encounters),
   the oncologists also mentioned individual and organisational resources
   (e. g. professional experience, well-educated nurses and good work
   organisation) for coping with job stress and improving interaction with
   patients. Within this study, we identified some obstacles on the
   individual and organisational level for good patient care, as working
   conditions which might lead to time pressure and stress, which
   subsequently have an impact on quality in patient care (e.g. less time
   for personal issues during patient consultations). Future stress
   research should conduct a more in-depth investigation of these and other
   interventions at both the individual and organisational levels in order

Abstract = {{Background: Patient-physician communication is critical for helping
   patients understand and complete the complex steps needed to diagnose
   stage and treat lung cancer. We assessed which domains of
   patient-physician communication about lung cancer and its treatment are
   associated with receipt of disease-directed, stage-appropriate
   treatment.
   Methods: Patients with recently diagnosed lung cancer were recruited
   from four medical centers in New York City from 2008 to 2011.
   Participants were surveyed about discussions with physicians regarding
   treatment, symptoms, and needs. Multiple regression analysis and
   structural equation modeling were used to assess which communication
   factors were associated with disease treatment.
   Results: Of the 352 participants, 191 (54\%) received disease-directed,
   stage-appropriate treatment. Unadjusted associations between
   communication items and treatment found that participants who felt that
   their physicians explained the risks and disadvantages of lung cancer
   treatment (p < 0.01), discussed their chances of cure (p = 0.02),
   discussed goals of treatment (p < 0.01), or who were warm and friendly
   (p = 0.04) were more likely to undergo treatment. Three communication
   domains were identified: treatment information, physician support, and
   patient symptoms/needs. After adjusting for known determinants of lung
   cancer treatment, increased treatment information was associated with
   higher probability of cancer-directed treatment (p = 0.003). Other
   communication domains (physician support or patient symptoms/needs) were
   not independent predictors of treatment (p > 0.05 for both comparisons).
   Conclusion: These data suggest that treatment information is
   particularly important for increasing the probability of cancer-directed
   therapy among lung cancer patients. Clinicians should ensure that they
   clearly discuss treatment goals and options with patients while
   maintaining empathy, supporting patient needs, and addressing symptoms.}},

Journal = {{NURSE EDUCATION TODAY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{1196-1200}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reports of a lack of compassionate care from nurses have
   resulted in calls to integrate the assessment of personal qualities into
   nursing student selection, with the intent to recruit individuals whose
   attributes reflect those desired in the practising nurse. Whilst nursing
   programmes are able to determine students' academic abilities on
   enrolment limited attention has been given to other qualities. Although
   there is an understanding of the qualities desired in the practising
   nurse, to date there has been limited exploration of nursing students'
   personal qualities as they enter nursing programmes and whether these
   change over time.
   Aims: To describe the personal qualities of newly enrolled Bachelor of
   Nursing students, and to determine if these qualities are age and gender
   specific and whether they change over time.
   Methods: The Personal Qualifies Assessment (PQA; www.pqa.netau) was
   completed by 138 nursing students on enrolment and repeated after three
   years.
   Results: Twenty four percent of students had PQA scores at the extreme
   ends (+/- 2 SD) of the continuum of one or more sub-scale distributions.
   Significant positive correlations were found between age and the PQA
   measured traits: self-control, resilience, narcissism, empathy and moral
   orientation. Females were significantly more conscientious, community
   orientated and involved; males had significantly higher narcissism and
   aloofness scores and lower empathy. For those students (n = 28) who
   completed the follow-up PQA, their personal qualities scores did not
   change.
   Conclusion: Most of the study sample possessed mid-range personal
   quality trait scores, but approximately a quarter of the nursing
   students recorded extreme scores. Older students were found to have a
   higher measure of self-control, resilience, empathy and narcissism and
   more communitarian in attitude. Significant differences were found
   between males' and females' scores. That personal qualities were
   unchanged after three years suggests the importance of incorporating the
   assessment of these qualities into selection and recruitment of nursing
   students. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The physician's role and empathy - a qualitative study of third year
   medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important in ensuring the quality of the
   patient-physician relationship. Several studies have concluded that
   empathy declines during medical training, especially during the third
   year. However, there is little empirical research on what may influence
   a medical student's empathy. In addition, studies of empathy in medicine
   have generally been dominated by quantitative approaches, primarily
   self-assessment questionnaires. This is a paradox given the complexity
   and importance of empathy. In this paper we explore medical students'
   opinions of what may foster or inhibit empathy during medical school,
   with a particular emphasis on how empathy is influenced by the
   initiation into the physician's role.
   Methods: We performed semi-structured qualitative interviews with 11
   third year medical students. Content analysis was used to analyse the
   transcribed interviews.
   Results: Five aspects of the the physician's role and the students' role
   acquisition emerged when the students were asked to describe what may
   influence their empathy: 1) Becoming and being a professional, 2) Rules
   concerning emotions and care, 3) Emotional control, 4) The primary
   importance of biomedical knowledge, and 5) Cynicism as a coping
   strategy.
   Conclusion: This study suggest that the described inhibitors of empathy
   may originate in the hidden curriculum and reinforce each other,
   creating a greater distance between the physician and the patient, and
   possibly resulting in decreased empathy. Mastering biomedical knowledge
   is an important part of the students' ideals of the physician's role,
   and sometimes objective and distanced ideals may suppress empathy and
   the students' own emotions.}},

Title = {{Women who are incarcerated for sexual offense in the North of France:
   Sociodemographic and psychopathological data}},
Journal = {{ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{172}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{432-436}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. This is a regional study about incarcerated women sentenced
   for sexual offense in the North of France. The purpose was to sum up
   several sociodemographical, criminological and psychopathological data
   to compare with data found in articles which are already published. Are
   there some common data between those women who are incarcerated for the
   same kind of violence?
   Materials and methods. This is a descriptive study, with a one-off data
   collect. It was based on a voluntary participation. First, we made a
   retrospective data collect in judicial and medical files. After that, we
   proposed an interview with women included to assess a Mini International
   Neuropsychiatric Interview and a short form of the Wechsler Adult
   Intelligence Scale.
   Results. Twenty-two women were included in the study, which allow us to
   assess that there are 7\% of women among sexual offenders incarcerated.
   Two third of them were sentenced for rape during on average 12 years.
   Two third of them will have a care obligation after liberation.
   Eighty-two percent of sexual crimes are chronic, 70\% of the victims are
   their children, especially girls (62\%), in 60\% the cooffender was the
   spouse even if 65\% are sentenced as the author of the crime, not only
   the accomplice. In their past, these women suffered from several abuses
   and deprivations. They present a weak socioeducative level.
   Seventy-eight percent of the sample has a mental deficiency. With the
   MINI, 50\% present alcohol abuse or dependency. Two third of the sample
   have already suffered from a depression and we found anxiety symptoms in
   67\% of the women.
   Even if the sample is a small one, it is quite the same size than other
   samples in published studies, which allows us to compare several data:
   Our sociodemographical and psychopathological data are pretty much the
   same than in the review. Moreover, our study confirmed, with the short
   form of the intelligence scale, the importance of the mental deficiency.
   We also confirmed that women are more often judged as the author of the
   sexual violence contrary to common stereotypes.
   Conclusions. - Psychiatric care obligation after liberation seems to be
   important and has to be adapted. It could be interesting to consider
   several psychopathological and personal life data in order to adapt the
   psychotherapy. For example, because of the mental deficiency, we can
   suggest these women to take part in a psychoeducative group, and to work
   on dealing with their emotions or their self-esteem.
   As they are more often sentenced as the author of the crime, it allows
   the psychiatric staff to work on their responsability, the sexual
   offense recognition, but also their empathy for the victim and their
   comportments and negative emotions before their acting out. (c) 2013
