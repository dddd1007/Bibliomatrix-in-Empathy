Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the effectiveness of motivational interviewing
   (MI) training among medical students.
   Methods: All students (n = 131) (year 5) at Lausanne Medical School,
   Switzerland were randomized into an experimental or a control group.
   After a training in basic communication skills (control condition), an
   8-h MI training was completed by 84.8\% students in the exprimental
   group. One week later, students in both groups were invited to meet with
   two standardized patients. MI skills were coded by blinded research
   assistants using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity 3.0.
   Results: Superior MI performance was shown for trained versus control
   students, as demonstrated by higher scores for ``Empathy{''} {[}p <
   0.001] and ``MI Spirit{''} {[}p < 0.001]. Scores were similar between
   groups for ``Direction{''}, indicating that students in both groups
   invited the patient to talk about behavior change. Behavior counts
   assessment demonstrated better performance in MI in trained versus
   untrained students regarding occurences of MI-adherent behavior {[}p <
   0.001], MI non-adherent behavior {[}p < 0.001], Closed questions {[}p <
   0.001], Open questions {[}p = 0.001], simple reflections {[}p = 0.03],
   and Complex reflections {[}p < 0.001]. Occurrences were similar between
   groups regarding ``Giving information{''}.
   Conclusion: An 8-h training workshop was associated with improved MI
   performance.
   Practice implications: These findings lend support for the
   implementation of MI training in medical schools. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose
   In addition to structural transformations, deeper changes are needed to
   enhance physicians' sense of meaning and satisfaction with their work
   and their ability to respond creatively to a dynamically changing
   practice environment. The purpose of this research was to understand
   what aspects of a successful continuing education program in mindful
   communication contributed to physicians' well-being and the care they
   provide.
   Method
   In 2008, the authors conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with
   primary care physicians who had recently completed a 52-hour mindful
   communication program demonstrated to reduce psychological distress and
   burnout while improving empathy. Interviews with a random sample of 20
   of the 46 physicians in the Rochester, New York, area who attended at
   least four of eight weekly sessions and four of eight monthly sessions
   were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively. The
   authors identified salient themes from the interviews.
   Results
   Participants reported three main themes: (1) sharing personal
   experiences from medical practice with colleagues reduced professional
   isolation, (2) mindfulness skills improved the participants' ability to
   be attentive and listen deeply to patients' concerns, respond to
   patients more effectively, and develop adaptive reserve, and (3)
   developing greater self-awareness was positive and transformative, yet
   participants struggled to give themselves permission to attend to their
   own personal growth.
   Conclusions
   Interventions to improve the quality of primary care practice and
   practitioner well-being should promote a sense of community, specific
   mindfulness skills, and permission and time devoted to personal growth.}},

   cross-sectional study was undertaken using paper-based versions of the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) and Medical Condition Regard
   Scale (MCRS), along with a brief set of demographic questions.
   Participants reported good empathy levels on JSPE. Attitudes towards
   intellectual disability, chronic pain, acute mental illness and terminal
   illness rated well on MCRS. Attitudes towards substance abuse, however,
   were lower. There were no significant differences between age groups,
   gender or year level of study. Overall results of this study were
   positive. Nursing students demonstrated acceptable empathy levels.
   Attitudes towards patients who abuse substances highlight an area that
   needs both further exploration and addressing. Attitudes towards mental
   health diagnoses were particularly favourable given that these often
   attract stigma and negative attitudes.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{There has been a move in medicine towards patient-centred care, leading
   to more demands from patients for particular therapies and treatments,
   and for wish-fulfilling medicine: the use of medical services according
   to the patient's wishes to enhance their subjective functioning,
   appearance or health. In contrast to conventional medicine, this use of
   medical services is not needed from a medical point of view. Boundaries
   in wish-fulfilling medicine are partly set by a physician's decision to
   fulfil or decline a patient's wish in practice. In order to develop a
   better understanding of how wish-fulfilling medicine occurs in practice
   in The Netherlands, a qualitative study (15 semistructured interviews
   and 1 focus group) was undertaken. The aim was to investigate the range
   and kind of arguments used by general practitioners and plastic surgeons
   in wish-fulfilling medicine. These groups represent the public funded
   realm of medicine as well as privately paid for services. Moreover, GPs
   and plastic surgeons can both be approached directly by patients in The
   Netherlands. The physicians studied raised many arguments that were
   expected: they used patient autonomy, risks and benefits, normality and
   justice to limit wish-fulfilling medicine. In addition, arguments new to
   this debate were uncovered, which were frequently used to justify
   compliance with a patient's request. Such arguments seem familiar from
   conventional medicine, including empathy, the patient-doctor
   relationship and reassurance. Moreover, certain arguments that play a
   significant role in the literature on wish-fulfilling medicine and
   enhancement were not mentioned, such as concepts of disease and the
   enhancement-treatment dichotomy and `suspect norms'.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical empathy is increasingly discussed in conventional and
   complementary medicine. Yet the term lacks an agreed conceptual base and
   definition. This article seeks to challenge preconceptions and stimulate
   conversation amongst the community of herbal practitioners, and beyond.
   It aims to contribute to consensus building around the meaning of
   clinical empathy and to the benefits it may offer practitioners,
   students and patients involved with the primary healthcare consultation.
   It is hoped that such an exploration will enable herbal practitioners to
   reflect on where they position themselves in a consultation and to what
   extent they integrate thoughts and feelings during their practice of the
   art and science of complementary medicine. The reading and experience as
   a medical herbalist and university learning facilitator led the author
   to the opinion that clinical empathy was a necessary clinical skill that
   has affective and cognitive aspects which can be developed, taught and
   integrated to improve the quality of patient healthcare. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Background: There is general consent that empathy is crucial for the
   physician-patient relationship and thus an important issue in medical
   education. This comparative study was designed to examine the
   differences in empathy between first year and final year medical
   students in Jimma University, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study among 131 first year and
   106 final year medical students was conducted in Jimma University,
   Ethiopia on academic year 2010/11. The study subjects were selected
   using simple random sampling technique from the list of the students.
   Study participation was voluntary. The Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale
   (BEES) was used for the detection of ``heart-reading{''}, i.e. emotional
   empathy and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RME-R test) to
   evaluate ``mind-reading{''}, i.e. cognitive empathy. We performed t-test
   to compare the mean difference in empathy and RME-R scores between the
   two groups of students. A linear regression was computed to identify
   potential factors influencing the BEES and RME-R.
   Results: Out of the total 237 students, 207 (87.3\%) were males. The
   mean age of first year and final year students was 19.3 +/- 1.1 and 24.0
   +/- 1.4 years respectively. First year students have scored 40.6 +/-
   23.8 while final year students scored 41.5 +/- 20.8 mean in the BEES
   measuring emotional empathy score. However, this difference was not
   statistically significant (t = -0.30, df = 231, P-value >0.05). Final
   year students had significantly higher mean cognitive empathy score
   (17.8 +/- 4.5) than first year students (14.4 +/- 4.8) {[}beta = 2.7,
   95\%CI (1.20, 4.13)]. Males had scored lower cognitive {[}beta = -2.5,
   95\%CI (-4.37, -0.66)] and emotional empathy {[}beta = -12.0, 95\% CI
   (-21.66, -5.46)].
   Conclusions: Low emotional (BEES) and cognitive empathy sores were found
   in first year and final year students of Jimma University could have
   implications on the medical education curricula. Medical education
   targeted at enhancing emotional empathy and increasing cognitive empathy
   is required by segmenting with gender for effective physician-patient
   interaction. The influence of empathy on clinical competence should be
   studied using more rigorous design.}},

Title = {{``Explicitly implicit{''}: examining the importance of physician
   nonverbal involvement during error disclosures}},
Journal = {{SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{142}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY/PRINCIPLES: Medical errors are prevalent, but
   physicians commonly lack the training and skills to disclose them to
   their patients. Existing research has yielded a set of verbal messages
   physicians should communicate during error disclosures. However,
   considering the emotional message contents, patients likely derive much
   of the meaning from physicians' nonverbal behaviours. The purpose of
   this study was to test the causal effects of physicians' nonverbal
   communication on error disclosure outcomes.
   METHODS: At a university hospital in the Southeastern United States, 318
   patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. The first
   group watched a video vignette of a verbally and nonverbally competent
   error disclosure by a person acting as a physician. The second group was
   exposed to a verbally competent but nonverbally incompetent error
   disclosure. The third group read an error disclosure transcript. Then,
   all patients responded to measures of closeness, trust, forgiveness,
   satisfaction, distress, empathy, and avoidance.
   RESULTS: The results evidenced that holding the verbal message content
   constant, physician nonverbal involvement was significantly associated
   with higher patient ratings of closeness, trust, empathy, satisfaction,
   and forgiveness, and with lower ratings of patient emotional distress
   and avoidance. These associations were not affected by patient
   predispositions such as sex, ethnicity, religion and previous
   experiences with medical errors.
   CONCLUSION: The findings of this study imply that nonverbal
   communication has a significant impact on error disclosure outcomes and
   thus should be considered as an important component of future research
   and disclosure training efforts.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: In response to limitations in access to subspecialty care, I
   present personal observations and suggestions related to education of
   future pediatricians regarding development of critical thinking skills,
   care of complex and chronically ill patients, development of empathy,
   and restoration of responsibility that may help ameliorate this serious
   problem. Toward this end, I also offer 1 approach, a 24/7 telephone
   consultation network, for enriching interaction of primary care
   providers (PCPs) and subspecialists who can potentially provide rapid
   access to needed advice, reduce demand for subspecialty appointments,
   bolster decision-making and expertise, and realign resources with need.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from 579 requests by PCPs for telephone
   consultation by subspecialists in 8 areas (including child psychiatry).
   RESULTS: Of calls, 27\% took <5 minutes and 79\% took 5 to 15 minutes.
   Of calls, 28\% resulted in a clinic visit; 8\% prompted hospital
   transfer, hospital admission, or referral to an emergency department;
   and the remaining 64\% resulted in continued management by PCP with
   reinforcement of the plan. Assuming most inquiries would have resulted
   in referral to a subspecialist were there no telephone consultation, we
   estimated that 70\% (8+64\%) of consultations realigned resources with
   need, resulting in large saving of unnecessary clinic visits, travel,
   expense to families, lost days at work, or missed school.
   CONCLUSIONS: Development of rapid telephone consultation networks could
   provide increased access to care for those children in greatest need,
   use limited resources more efficiently, foster collegial and productive
   relationships between medical providers, and increase expertise of PCPs
   and subspecialists. Pediatrics 2012;129:961-967}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To use reflective writing to evaluate a new required palliative
   care experience for third year medical students.
   Method: The authors used a constant comparison method based on grounded
   theory to conduct a thematic analysis of reflective writings produced by
   third-year medical students completing a mandatory week-long clinical
   rotation in palliative care during academic year 2010 at the University
   of Louisville.
   Results: Two broad thematic categories were identified: what the
   students learned and what the students experienced. Student writings
   revealed learning about palliative care (pain management, family
   meetings, goals of care, patient-family centered care, timing of
   palliative care, and delivering bad news); being a doctor (knowledge,
   communication, presence, empathy, not giving false hope, and
   person-focused care); the patient (importance of family, the experience
   of dying, and the uniqueness of each patient); and themselves (need to
   be non-judgmental, ability to do palliative care, self-limitations,
   becoming a better physician, and dealing with death). Student
   reflections centered on encounters with patients and families, internal
   emotional responses, and self-transformation.
   Conclusions: Systematic analysis of reflective writing provides
   educators with valuable data about students' learning experiences. These
   results may inform the design and modification of the curriculum.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{598-602}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Residency training is a challenging period in a physician's career owing
   to a multitude of stressors perhaps not previously encountered. In some
   cases, these stressors may culminate in a state of burnout. In response,
   much has been written about the issues of personal wellness during
   residency training. Recently, duty hours reform has been the major focus
   of addressing resident wellness; however, this intervention has
   established little benefit and has created unintended negative
   consequences. Alternatively, an emerging solution may be the
   implementation of resident wellness programs into residency training.
   Such programs are defined by a combination of active and passive
   initiatives targeting the various domains of physical, mental, social,
   and intellectual wellness. In contrast to duty hours reform, resident
   wellness programs are generally free from controversy and have been
   shown to improve resident wellness and enhance empathy.
   This article highlights the salient causes of burnout as it applies to
   present-day resident physicians and the patient care they provide.
   Moreover, in the wake of the controversy surrounding duty hours reform,
   a novel approach to resident wellness involving structured resident
   wellness programs is discussed. Specifically included are the
   fundamental components of a wellness program, the advantages held over
   duty hours reform, methods to evaluate program efficacy, and the current
   evidence to support these initiatives. Formal wellness curricula,
   including an evaluative process, should be an integral component of
   physician training. These programs represent a new hope in the solution
   to the long-debated issue of burnout and wellness during residency
   training.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, ``reflection{''} and ``reflective writing{''}
   have become familiar terms and practices in medical education. The
   authors of this article argue that the use of the terms requires more
   thoughtfulness and precision, particularly because medical educators ask
   students to do so much reflection and reflective writing. First, the
   authors discuss John Dewey's thoughts on the elements of reflection.
   Then the authors turn the discussion to composition studies in an effort
   to form a more robust conception of reflective writing. In particular,
   they examine what the discipline of composition studies refers to as the
   writing process. Next, they offer two approaches to teaching
   composition: the expressivist orientation and the critical/cultural
   studies orientation. The authors examine the vigorous debate over how to
   respond to reflective writing, and, finally, they offer a set of
   recommendations for incorporating reflection and reflective writing into
   the medical curriculum.}},

Title = {{Associations of Medical Student Personality and Health/Wellness
   Characteristics With Their Medical School Performance Across the
   Curriculum}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{476-485}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To assess the relationships of cognitive and noncognitive performance
   predictors to medical student preclinical and clinical performance
   indicators across medical school years 1 to 3 and to evaluate the
   association of psychological health/wellness factors with performance.
   Method
   In 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, correlational,
   retrospective study of all 175 students at the Saint Louis University
   School of Medicine who had just completed their third (first clinical)
   year. Students were asked to complete assessments of personality,
   stress, anxiety, depression, social support, and community cohesion.
   Performance measures included total Medical College Admission Test
   (MCAT) score, preclinical academic grades, National Board of Medical
   Examiners subject exam scores, United States Medical Licensing
   Examination Step 1 score, clinical evaluations, and Humanism in Medicine
   Honor Society nominations.
   Results
   A total of 152 students (87\%) participated. MCAT scores predicted
   cognitive performance indicators (academic tests), whereas personality
   variables (conscientiousness, extraversion, empathy) predicted
   noncognitive indicators (clinical evaluations, humanism nominations).
   Conscientiousness predicted all clinical skills, extraversion predicted
   clinical skills reflecting interpersonal behavior, and empathy predicted
   motivation. Health/wellness variables had limited associations with
   performance. In multivariate analyses that included control for shelf
   exam scores, conscientiousness predicted clinical evaluations, and
   extraversion and empathy predicted humanism nominations.
   Conclusions
   This study identified two sets of skills (cognitive, noncognitive) used
   during medical school, with minimal overlap across the types of
   performance (e.g., exam performance versus clinical interpersonal
   skills) they predict. Medical school admission and evaluation efforts
   may need to be modified to reflect the importance of personality and
   other noncognitive factors.}},

Title = {{General practitioners' management of mental disorders: A rewarding
   practice with considerable obstacles}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Primary care improvement is the cornerstone of current
   reforms. Mental disorders (MDs) are a leading cause of morbidity
   worldwide and widespread in industrialised countries. MDs are treated
   mainly in primary care by general practitioners (GPs), even though the
   latter ability to detect, diagnose, and treat patients with MDs is often
   considered unsatisfactory. This article examines GPs' management of MDs
   in an effort to acquire more information regarding means by which GPs
   deal with MD cases, impact of such cases on their practices, factors
   that enable or hinder MD management, and patient-management strategies.
   Methods: This study employs a mixed-method approach with emphasis on
   qualitative investigation. Based on a previous survey of 398 GPs in
   Quebec, Canada, 60 GPs representing a variety of practice settings were
   selected for further study. A 10-minute-long questionnaire comprising 27
   items was administered, and 70-minute-long interviews were conducted.
   Quantitative (SPSS) and qualitative (NVivo) analyses were performed.
   Results: At least 20\% of GP visits were MD-related. GPs were
   comfortable managing common MDs, but not serious MDs. GPs' based their
   treatment of MDs on pharmacotherapy, support therapy, and
   psycho-education. They used clinical intuition with few clinical tools,
   and closely followed their patients with MDs. Practice features (salary
   or hourly fees payment; psycho-social teams on-site; strong informal
   networks), and GPs' individual characteristics (continuing medical
   education; exposure and interest in MDs; traits like empathy) favoured
   MD management. Collaboration with psychologists and psychiatrists was
   considered key to good MD management. Limited access to specialists,
   system fragmentation, and underdeveloped group practice and shared-care
   models were impediments. MD management was seen as burdensome because it
   required more time, flexibility, and emotional investment. Strategies
   exist to reduce the burden (one-problem-per-visit rule; longer time
   slots). GPs found MD practice rewarding as patients were seen as
   grateful and more complying with medical recommendations compared to
   other patients, generally leading to positive outcomes.
   Conclusions: To improve MD management, this study highlights the
   importance of extending multidisciplinary GP practice settings with
   salary or hourly fee payment; access to psychotherapeutic and
   psychiatric expertise; and case-discussion training involving local
   networks of GPs and MD specialists that encourage both knowledge
   transfer and shared care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The interviews and interactions with patients are part of
   everyday health care provider. However, there is sometimes a difficulty
   in communication, linked to several factors. For this reason, the use of
   images to illustrate the medical conditions in the outpatient clinic can
   improve patient communication. We report our initial experience with the
   use of images to manage the quality of care to surigcal patients.
   Methodology: He used a computer to show pictures of the following
   conditions: surgery for an inguinal hernia, cholelithiasis,
   cholecystitis and the choledocholithiasis and finally thyroid pathology.
   Were randomized two groups of patients. Each of the affected patients in
   any stage of the disease, they explained their problems. In one of the
   groups also showed the patient was using the current image and continued
   to give appropriate explanations related to pathology. Thereafter,
   patients in both groups filled in an anonymous questionnaire in which
   they responded to what degree it was considered useful this methodology,
   and degree of satisfaction received outpatient treatment with or without
   the deployment of images by computer. We have analyzed the average time
   expected and made a visit.
   Results: 187 patients will be visited in the consultations over a period
   of 8 months. In 83 patients have been using images to give the
   explanations in external consultations. Of these, 24 patients suffering
   from thyroid, 24 hernias or incisional hernias and 35 patients with
   biliary tract pathology. Patients in the group were shown images of
   conditions have responded mostly be very satisfied with the use of
   images while the explanations are given on the patient's illness. Also,
   over 80\% of patients report being satisfied with this system. The
   visiting time was not lengthened.
   Discussion: Despite the existence of different variables that can
   influence patient satisfaction, use of images to illustrate surgical
   diseases to patients improves communication and flow of the explanations
   of the physician.
   Conclusions: The relationship doctor-patient communication is the key
   event in an outpatient setting. It determines a good overall result of
   the clinical interview. The use of images in an outpatient improves
   communication between patients and doctors. Moreover, the degree of
   satisfaction is high and the degree of understanding of the disease. It
   seems useful to incorporate in our outpatient clinic.}},

   Multivariate generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate
   associations between residents' well-being and empathy and assessments
   of their knowledge and clinical performance.
   MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables were empathy using the Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index (IRI), burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory,
   depression using a standardized two-question screening instrument, and
   quality of life using a Linear Analog Self-Assessment item and the
   Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-8). Dependent variables were
   mini-CEX, ITE, and the validated six-item Mayo clinical performance
   assessment.
   RESULTS: 202 residents (64.7\%) provided both wellbeing and at least one
   category of assessment data. In multivariate models, residents' scores
   on the IRI empathy measure of ``the tendency to adopt the psychological
   view of others{''} were associated with higher peer ratings on
   ``desirability as a physician for a family member{''} (beta=0.023, 95\%
   CI=0.007-0.039, p=0.004). Additionally, burnout was associated with
   higher supervisor ratings of communication (beta=0.309, 95\%
   CI=0.100-0.517, p=0.004). There were no observed associations between
   ITE or mini-CEX scores and resident quality of life, burnout, fatigue,
   depression, or empathy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most dimensions of resident well-being were not associated
   with residents' knowledge scores and assessments of their clinical
   performance by other members of the health care team, which supports the
   trustworthiness of these measures. Nonetheless, correlations of resident
   empathy and burnout with assessments completed by peers and supervising
   residents suggest that some ratings of residents may be influenced by
   interpersonal factors.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT Empathy towards patients is associated with improved health
   outcomes. However, quantitative studies using self-reported data have
   not provided an in-depth opportunity to explore the lived experiences of
   medical students concerning empathy.
   OBJECTIVES This study was designed to investigate undergraduate medical
   students' experiences of the phenomenon of empathy during the course of
   their medical education and to explore the essence of their empathy.
   METHODS This was a descriptive, phenomenological study of medical
   student interviews conducted using the method of Colaizzi and Giorgi.
   The sample (n = 10) was drawn from medical students in Years 4 and 5.
   In-depth interviews were used to obtain a clear understanding of their
   experiences of empathy in the context of patient care. Interviews
   continued until no new information could be identified from transcripts.
   RESULTS Five themes were identified from analysis: the meaning of
   empathy; willingness to empathise; innate empathic ability; empathy
   decline or enhancement, and empathy education. Empathic ability was
   manifested through two factors: innate capacity for empathy, and
   barriers to displaying empathy. Different experiences and explanations
   concerning the decline or enhancement of empathy during medical
   education were explored.
   CONCLUSIONS Empathic ability was identified as an important innate
   attribute which nevertheless can be enhanced by educational
   interventions. Barriers to the expression of empathy with patients were
   identified. Role-modelling by clinical teachers was seen as the most
   important influence on empathy education for students engaged in
   experiential learning.}},

Title = {{The legacy of altruism in health care: the promotion of empathy,
   prosociality and humanism}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{317-325}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES This study aimed to examine concepts of altruism and empathy
   among medical students and professionals in conjunction with health care
   initiatives designed to support the maintenance of these qualities.
   METHODS We searched for the terms ` altruism', ` altruistic', `
   helping', ` prosocial behaviour' and ` empathy' in the Englishlanguage
   literature published from 1980 to the present within the Ovid MEDLINE,
   PsycInfo and PubMed databases. We used conceptual analysis to examine
   the relationships among altruism, empathy and related prosocial concepts
   in health care in order to understand how such factors may relate to
   emotional and career burnout, cynicism, decreased helping and decreased
   patient- centredness in care.
   RESULTS Altruistic ideals and qualities of empathy appear to decrease
   among some medical students as they progress through their education.
   During this process, students face increasingly heavy workloads, deal
   with strenuous demands and become more acquainted with non- humanistic
   informal practices inherent in the culture of medicine. In combination,
   these factors increase the likelihood that emotional suppression,
   detachment from patients, burnout and other negative consequences may
   result, perhaps as a means of self-preservation. Alternatively, by
   making a mindful and intentional choice to endeavour for self-care and a
   healthy work-life balance, medical students can uphold humanistic and
   prosocial attitudes and behaviours.
   CONCLUSIONS Promoting altruism in the context of a compensated health
   care career is contradictory and misguided. Instead, an approach to
   clinical care that is prosocial and empathic is recommended. Training in
   mindfulness, self-reflection and emotion skills may help medical
   students and professionals to recognise, regulate and behaviourally
   demonstrate empathy within clinical and professional encounters.
   However, health care initiatives to increase empathy and other
   humanistic qualities will be limited unless more practical and feasible
   emotion skills training is offered to and accepted by medical students.
   Success will be further moderated by the culture of medicine's full
   acceptance of empathy and humanism into its customs, beliefs, values,
   interactions and daily practices.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{When physicians interview patients with ambiguous or nonspecific
   symptoms, they often try to reassure them with the purpose of explaining
   that no dangerous illness or disease is causing the symptoms.
   Unfortunately the evidence suggests that patients with benign (back)
   pain instead feel misunderstood, frustrated and unsatisfied with the
   consultation. Validation is a communication method that focuses on
   understanding and empathy as a platform for problem solving and it may
   be applicable for interviews in medical settings. The aim of this study
   was to examine the effects of validation on patient satisfaction, pain
   and affect.
   To this end 28 nurses with (re) current back pain were recruited and
   randomly assigned to be interviewed in a validating or invalidating
   condition. Patient satisfaction, affect, pain, disability, pain
   catastrophizing, and fear of movement were assessed immediately after
   the interview.
   The results show that the participants in the validated group were more
   satisfied with the interview than participants in the invalidating
   condition. Moreover, they showed a significant decrease on all measures
   of negative affect as well as for pain. For example, there was a
   significant between group difference in frustration where frustration
   decreased in the validation group, while it increased in the
   invalidation condition.
   A validating communication style seems to be beneficial for enhancing
   patient satisfaction, as well as diminishing negative affect and pain
   intensity ratings. Our results suggest that validation might be a viable
   technique to use in clinical examinations of patients suffering pain.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Conceptualising the doctor-patient relationship as a `window
   mirror' exposes care delivery from doctor to self, doctor to patient,
   patient to self, and patient to doctor. These directions have not been
   measured concurrently. We aimed to develop and validate a patient
   questionnaire informed by this model.
   Methods: A modified-Delphi exercise was conducted to develop, and face
   and content validate, the questionnaire. Stage 2 surveyed 495 patients
   in general practice to assess the internal consistency and construct
   validity of the questionnaire.
   Results: The questionnaire is face and content valid. Its internal
   reliability and construct validity appear good. Patients who care more
   about their doctor also care more about themselves. A patient or doctor
   who cares about the other person is associated with increased self-care
   by that person.
   Conclusions: Further development and testing of the patient
   questionnaire is warranted to validate measurement of how patients
   perceive the caring they and their doctor give, and receive from, each
   other.
   Practice implications: From the patient perspective the questionnaire
   may increase awareness of the importance of family doctors and patients
   caring about each other and themselves. It may inform and evaluate
   medical students, educational programmes and caring in doctor-patient
   relationships. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In the German health system general practice has changed
   drastically in the past few years and patients' opportunities to get
   medical informations have increased significantly. In light of this,
   patients' needs in general practice should be reassessed.
   Patients and methods: 279 patients from 16 practices mainly in Hessen
   and Rhineland-Palatinate were interviewed. Using principal factor
   analysis, 51 questions about doctors were analyzed regarding possible
   dimensions of patient care needs.
   Results: The dimensions of patient care needs could be described with
   four scales: (1) social situation and emotional support, (2) the
   practitioner's expertise, explanations and information, (3) empathy and
   esteem for patients and (4) availability of the practitioner and care to
   chronic patients. In older age groups the importance of psychosocial
   care was emphasized as well as the practitioner's availability and care
   for patients with chronic diseases.
   Conclusion: Patient care needs are concentrated in four scales, which
   include psychosocial and continuous care and availability for patients
   with chronic diseases. These tasks should be further emphasized in
   medical education and also represented in the remuneration of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Professionalism is a central tenet of the dental
   undergraduate curriculum. Dental undergraduate curricula and standards
   expect the dentist to put the patients interests first, and in this
   respect, an important attitude is empathy.
   Objective: This study examined the self-reported empathy levels of
   first-year dental students before and after an early analytical exposure
   to behavioural sciences and the clinical encounter.
   Method: First-year dental undergraduates were given an attitudinal
   questionnaire to complete before and after the behavioural science
   course. The questionnaire consisted of the HP version of the Jefferson
   Scale of Physician Empathy and the Patient-Practitioner Orientation
   Scale. Paired non-parametric tests and Spearman's Rho correlations,
   along with simple descriptive statistics, were used to test the
   statistical significance of observations.
   Results: A total of 66 paired questionnaires were returned, giving a
   response rate of 75\%. There were no correlations between age and total
   mean score of JSPE or PPOS, and no gender differences. There was a
   significant increase (P < 0.01) in empathy as measured by the JSPE
   between pre-and post-course scores. The PPOS did not record any
   significant change in the sharing, caring or total scale scores pre-to
   post-course.
   Conclusion: The modified JSPE has potential utility in assessing the
   cognitive-affective aspect of dental students' empathy. Using the JSPE,
   short-term measurable empathy changes can be detected in first-year
   dental undergraduates after the structured and assessed analytical
   introduction to the clinical encounter and environment.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. This article is a report of a study to determine the effect of an
   educational programme and to follow up weekly meetings on nurses and
   medical residents attitudes towards positive communication and
   collaboration. Background. Clear and appropriate communication and
   interdisciplinary collaboration is critical to the delivery of quality
   care. Collaborative practice among all healthcare professionals creates
   a positive work environment, decreases costs, improves job satisfaction
   among nurses and improves patient care, as well as decreasing patient
   morbidity and mortality. Poor communication and lack of teamwork or
   collaboration have been cited as persistent problems in healthcare.
   Method. The study was conducted in 2008 - 2009 at a hospital where a new
   medical residency programme was beginning and nurses had no prior
   experience working with medical residents. A quasi-experimental pre
   test, post-test design was used. The Jefferson Scale of Attitudes
   towards Physician-Nurse Collaboration and the Communication,
   Collaboration and Critical Thinking for Quality Patient Outcomes Survey
   tool measured the attitudes of 68 nurses and 47 medical residents in the
   areas of positive communication and collaboration. Results/Findings. The
   study demonstrates that a formal educational programme and follow-up
   discussions improved the attitudes of both nurses and medical residents
   on the Jefferson scale (medical residents t = 4.68, P = 0.001, nurses t
   = 4.37, P = 0.001) and on the communication scale (medical residents t =
   4.23, P = 0.001, nurses t = 4.13, P = 0.001). Conclusion. Continuing
   education for nurses, medical residents and other healthcare providers
   may assist in developing positive communication styles and promote
   collegiality and team work.}},

Title = {{The trajectory to diagnosis with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a
   qualitative study}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the patient's experience of the trajectory to
   receiving a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and
   inform the provision of care for this patient group.
   Design: Qualitative study using in-depth one-to-one interviews and
   pictorial representations. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Setting: Participants were interviewed in their own homes across
   England.
   Participants: 30 patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (18
   participants were women, mean age 56 and range 26-80 years and time
   since diagnosis ranged from a few months to more than 12 years)
   participated.
   Results: All participants, regardless of the time since diagnosis,
   vividly described the process from manifestation of symptoms to
   receiving a confirmed diagnosis. The authors present data using three
   major themes: (i) making sense of symptoms, (ii) process of elimination
   and (iii) being diagnosed with PAH. Making sense of symptoms represented
   an early period of perseverance people tried to carry-on as usual
   despite `unexplained breathlessness'. As time progressed, this period
   was punctuated by critical events that triggered seeking medical advice.
   Once medical contact had been made, patients described a period of
   `elimination' and convoluted contact with the medical profession.
   Dyspnoea misdiagnosis was a key factor that delayed the PAH diagnosis.
   Diagnosis disclosure by some medical professionals was also viewed as
   lacking empathy. More positive experiences were relayed when the medical
   team disclosing the diagnosis acknowledged previous limitations.
   Conclusions: A lack of awareness of this illness from both the sufferer
   themselves and the medical profession emerged as a central theme and led
   to prolonged periods of being misdiagnosed. The application of a
   diagnostic pathway for unexplained dyspnoea that alerts practitioners to
   rare conditions could expedite the process of correct diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Interventions for providers to promote a patient-centred approach in
   clinical consultations}},
Journal = {{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{12}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Communication problems in health care may arise as a result of
   healthcare providers focusing on diseases and their management, rather
   than people, their lives and their health problems. Patient-centred
   approaches to care delivery in the patient encounter are increasingly
   advocated by consumers and clinicians and incorporated into training for
   healthcare providers. However, the impact of these interventions
   directly on clinical encounters and indirectly on patient satisfaction,
   healthcare behaviour and health status has not been adequately
   evaluated.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of interventions for healthcare providers that aim
   to promote patient-centred care (PCC) approaches in clinical
   consultations.
   Search methods
   For this update, we searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP),
   PsycINFO (OvidSP), and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) from January 2000 to June
   2010. The earlier version of this review searched MEDLINE (1966 to
   December 1999), EMBASE (1985 to December 1999), PsycLIT (1987 to
   December 1999), CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) and HEALTH STAR (1975 to
   December 1999). We searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for
   inclusion and contacted study authors to identify other relevant
   studies. Any study authors who were contacted for further information on
   their studies were also asked if they were aware of any other published
   or ongoing studies that would meet our inclusion criteria.
   Selection criteria
   In the original review, study designs included randomized controlled
   trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies,
   and interrupted time series studies of interventions for healthcare
   providers that promote patient-centred care in clinical consultations.
   In the present update, we were able to limit the studies to randomized
   controlled trials, thus limiting the likelihood of sampling error. This
   is especially important because the providers who volunteer for studies
   of PCC methods are likely to be different from the general population of
   providers. Patient-centred care was defined as a philosophy of care that
   encourages: (a) shared control of the consultation, decisions about
   interventions or management of the health problems with the patient,
   and/or (b) a focus in the consultation on the patient as a whole person
   who has individual preferences situated within social contexts (in
   contrast to a focus in the consultation on a body part or disease).
   Within our definition, shared treatment decision-making was a sufficient
   indicator of PCC. The participants were healthcare providers, including
   those in training.
   Data collection and analysis
   We classified interventions by whether they focused only on training
   providers or on training providers and patients, with and without
   condition-specific educational materials. We grouped outcome data from
   the studies to evaluate both direct effects on patient encounters
   (consultation process variables) and effects on patient outcomes
   (satisfaction, healthcare behaviour change, health status). We pooled
   results of RCTs using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative
   risks (RR) applying a fixed-effect model.
   Main results
   Forty-three randomized trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 29
   are new in this update. Inmost of the studies, training interventions
   were directed at primary care physicians (general practitioners,
   internists, paediatricians or family doctors) or nurses practising in
   community or hospital outpatient settings. Some studies trained
   specialists. Patients were predominantly adults with general medical
   problems, though two studies included children with asthma. Descriptive
   and pooled analyses showed generally positive effects on consultation
   processes on a range of measures relating to clarifying patients'
   concerns and beliefs; communicating about treatment options; levels of
   empathy; and patients' perception of providers' attentiveness to them
   and their concerns as well as their diseases. A new finding for this
   update is that short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful
   as longer training.
   The analyses showed mixed results on satisfaction, behaviour and health
   status. Studies using complex interventions that focused on providers
   and patients with condition-specific materials generally showed benefit
   in health behaviour and satisfaction, as well as consultation processes,
   with mixed effects on health status. Pooled analysis of the fewer than
   half of included studies with adequate data suggests moderate beneficial
   effects from interventions on the consultation process; and mixed
   effects on behaviour and patient satisfaction, with small positive
   effects on health status. Risk of bias varied across studies. Studies
   that focused only on provider behaviour frequently did not collect data
   on patient outcomes, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about
   the relative effect of intervention focus on providers compared with
   providers and patients.
   Authors' conclusions
   Interventions to promote patient-centred care within clinical
   consultations are effective across studies in transferring
   patient-centred skills to providers. However the effects on patient
   satisfaction, health behaviour and health status are mixed. There is
   some indication that complex interventions directed at providers and
   patients that include condition-specific educational materials have
   beneficial effects on health behaviour and health status, outcomes not
   assessed in studies reviewed previously. The latter conclusion is
   tentative at this time and requires more data. The heterogeneity of
   outcomes, and the use of single item consultation and health behaviour
   measures limit the strength of the conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Necker Hospital for Sick Children
   cares for severely ill newborn infants and children. Ethical dilemmas
   about whether to continue care, reduce or abandon treatment occur daily.
   A partnership with the parents represents an essential aspect of the
   medical and paramedical care provided. A psychologist intervenes in this
   context to support the health care personnel and to analyse the
   functioning of the system. A study was carried out to assess how useful
   family interviews were when announcing the worsening condition of the
   hospitalized child. The idea of re-enacting these interviews with the
   medical team which had been involved, led to a new way of conducting
   such interviews. The work of the staff members who had taken part in
   this re-enacting was assessed. Analysing these practices as well as
   listening to what the staff had to say during informal exchanges enabled
   the team to express their unvoiced concerns. Using such techniques,
   practices have been improved and in this paper, we propose to offer one
   theoretical elaboration of this point. The original role played here by
   a psychologist who is specifically devoted to listening to the staff of
   a highly specialised hospital service, dealing daily with vital, ethical
   questions, could well be continued and assessed at regular intervals.}},

Title = {{An exploration of empathy and correlates among Taiwanese nurses}},
Journal = {{JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{169-176}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Empathy is essential to optimal health care. The empathy of nurses,
   who make up the front line in patient care, merits particular attention.
   However, information on empathy among nurses is still limited. This
   study aimed to examine the nurses' empathy and correlates in Taiwan.
   Methods: The study used a cross-sectional correlational design with a
   convenience sampling method to recruit full-time nurses from a hospital
   in southern Taiwan between May and November of 2010. A structured
   questionnaire was used to gather data on respondents' demographic and
   job characteristics and included a Chinese version of the Jefferson
   Scale of Empathy. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, Pearson correlations,
   analysis of variance, and stepwise linear regression were used for
   analysis.
   Results: Of a total of 740 questionnaires that were distributed, 675
   valid copies were returned, for a response rate of 91.2\%. After the
   exclusion of 15 cases because of missing data, 660 participants were
   included for data analysis. The mean empathy score for entire
   participants was 110.66. Those who received empathy-related training,
   worked on a psychiatric ward, had children, and had more years of
   nursing work experience demonstrated significantly higher empathy
   scores. These four variables accounted for 22.0\% of the variance in
   empathy among participants.
   Conclusions: Our findings may help hospital administrators better
   understand the empathy level of nurses, and can serve as a reference in
   the design of appropriate in-service training to improve empathy among
   nurses.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{503-507}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many religions underline the value of merciful acts,
   especially the care of the sick. The aim of the survey was to verify the
   hypothesis that a higher religiosity correlates with a more desirable
   ethical attitude towards patients.
   Method: An anonymous questionnaire consisting of standardized tools:
   Scale of Attitudes towards the Patient (SAtP) (four dimensions: respect
   for autonomy, altruism, empathy and holistic approach to a patient), the
   Scale of Religious Attitudes (SReAt) evaluating the religiosity, and
   some questions related to the role of religious beliefs in respondents'
   professional lives. The research was carried out on a group of 528
   Polish physicians, 324 of whom returned the questionnaire (return =
   61\%); 51\% women, 49\% men; average work experience: 17.03 years; 93\%
   Catholics.
   Results: Religiosity correlates positively with altruism (r=0.12;
   p<0.05), holistic approach (r=0.18; p<0.01) and empathy (r=0.20;
   p<0.01), but not with respect for autonomy. For the majority of
   physicians, religious faith is an important supportive factor,
   especially in making difficult decisions. Surgeons are less religious
   (M=5.32; SD=1.06) than non-surgeons (M=5.61; SD=0.93); (t=-2.59,
   p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Physicians' religiosity is an essential factor shaping their
   attitude towards patients. The majority of physicians declared that
   their religious faith influences their professional decisions,
   especially in difficult situations. The religiosity variable explains
   physicians' moral attitude better than the denomination (religious
   affiliation) variable. Physician-patient relation frameworks should take
   into account not only patients' but also physicians' cultural and
   religious beliefs.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between nurses and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients
   begins from the time of the selection of medical treatment for renal
   replacement therapy. There are various roles in this field that involve
   nurses, not only in providing technical guidance to patients but also in
   relaying dietary restrictions including those on fluid and diet, in
   providing information on public welfare for dialysis patients and in
   fostering interactions between the patient and doctors, nutritionists,
   social workers and medical support staff. The nurse plays an important
   role in the success of a PD training program. Only highly trained nurses
   should carry out PD training. The nurse trains the patient or a family
   member as a helper to perform PD. The ultimate goal is to make a plan to
   help the patient maintain his or her general condition and expand the
   quality of life by self-care. However, the most important role of nurses
   is to display empathy to the patient, that is, to put themselves in the
   patient's position, to foster an ongoing interaction between themselves
   and the patient and to listen to the patient and understand what is in
   the mind of the patient.}},

Title = {{Development of emotional intelligence in a team-based learning internal
   medicine clerkship}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{802-806}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although increasing number of articles have been published
   on team-based learning (TBL), none has explored team emotional
   intelligence.
   Aim: We extend the literature by examining changes in team emotional
   intelligence during a third year clerkship where TBL is a primary
   instructional strategy. We hypothesized that team emotional intelligence
   will change in a positive direction (i.e., increase) during the
   clerkship.
   Method: With IRB approval, during the 2009-2010 academic year third-year
   students in their internal medicine clerkship (N = 105, 100\% response
   rate) completed the Workgroup Emotional Intelligence Profile - Short
   Version (WEIP-S) at the beginning and at the end of their 12-week
   clerkship. TBL is an instructional strategy utilized during the internal
   medicine clerkship.
   Results: Paired t-tests showed that team emotional intelligence
   increased significantly pre to post clerkship for three of the four
   areas: awareness of own emotions (p = 0.018), recognizing emotions in
   others (p = 0.031), and ability to manage other's emotions (p = 0.013).
   There was no change for ability to control own emotions (p = 0.570).
   Conclusion: In an internal medicine clerkship, where TBL is utilized as
   an instructional strategy, team emotional intelligence increases. This
   supports TBL as an adjunctive tool to traditional medical education
   pedagogy.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to test hypothetical associations between

   Portuguese version of NEO-FFI was administered in order to characterize
   participants in terms of five personality traits: Neuroticism,
   Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, and
   Conscientiousness. Self-reported empathy measures were obtained with the
   Portuguese version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy
   (JSPE-spv), a Likert-type questionnaire specifically developed for
   administration in health sciences settings that measures domains, such
   as compassionate care and perspective taking. Correlation analysis,
   multivariate analysis of covariance, and logistic regression analysis
   were conducted. The results confirmed positive associations between
   agreeableness, openness to experience and empathy, and did not support
   our hypothesis of negative associations between neuroticism and empathy.
   It is suggested that that the personality of students should be taken

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{E464-E468}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is an important element of professionalism in
   medicine. Thus, evaluation and enhancement empathy in physicians is
   important, regardless of geographical boundaries.
   Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the psychometrics of a Korean
   version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) among Korean
   physicians.
   Methods: The Korean version of JSPE was completed by 229 physicians in
   Korea.
   Results: Item-total score correlations were all positive and
   statistically significant. Cronbach's coefficient alpha was 0.84. The
   mean score was 98.2 (SD = 12.0), which was lower than that reported for
   American and Italian physicians. The emerged factor structure of the
   translated version was somewhat similar to that reported for American
   physicians, although the order was different. Significant differences in
   the mean empathy scores were observed between men and women and among
   physicians in different specialties.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence in support of reliability and
   construct validity of the Korean version of JSPE for assessing empathy
   among Korean physicians. The disparity between Korean physicians and
   physicians from other countries may be explained by differences in the
   culture of medical education and medical practice. It suggests an
   exploration of cross-cultural differences in physician empathy.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{E338-E348}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although communication skills training (CST) enhances
   patient-centred skills and attitudes, the literature indicates a
   problematic transfer of these from education into practice.
   Aim: We explored `lived' experiences of medical students and doctors to
   gain a better understanding of the impact of CST on patient-centredness
   in the transition to real practice.
   Methods: From a phenomenological perspective, we conducted 15 interviews
   and 11 focus groups with 4-9 participants/group (n=67) at two
   universities and carried out constant comparative analysis.
   Results: The gap between education and practice is the central
   phenomenon. Although CST raises students' communication awareness and
   self-efficacy in an `ideal' context, this paradoxically seems to
   jeopardize their ability to bridge the gulf. In addition, CST does not
   come to grips with students' attitudes. However, CST appears to be
   successful in equipping students with long-lasting `handles'. Yet
   students need more support to mould the provided `ideal' models into
   their own unique style of context-specific patient-centred behaviour.
   This implies: raising students' awareness of own attitudes and
   communication styles, offering a more realistic training ground,
   integrating CST with clinical experience and translating the
   primary-care-rooted concept of patient-centredness into various
   specialization contexts.
   Conclusion: CST could raise its impact by supporting students' recycling
   processes towards a personal style of context-sensitive
   patient-centredness.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{E325-E331}},
Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about medical students' perceptions of the
   factors that influence their academic performance.
   Aim: To detect factors medical students, in the final years of their
   undergraduate medical studies, believe affect their academic
   performance.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with high-achieving and
   re-sitting students in the final two years of their studies in a London
   medical school. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic
   content analysis was conducted. Similarities and differences in factors
   perceived to affect the academic performance of high-achieving and
   re-sitting students were identified.
   Results: Eight re-sitting and ten high-achieving students were
   interviewed. Three core themes were identified: engagement with
   learning; reflections on learning methods and experiences and the
   application of learning to future practice. High-achieving students
   showed a greater awareness of what worked in terms of their approaches
   to learning and coping with difficulty than re-sitting students. There
   were also differences in the degree of positive engagement with peers,
   suggesting the positive contribution of socialising with other medical
   students.
   Conclusions: This exploratory qualitative study identified attitudes,
   behaviours and motivations that appeared to contribute to success or
   failure at medical school. Our findings suggest ways to improve
   appraisal, remediation and support mechanisms for students.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Human dissection commonly occurs early in the undergraduate
   medical school curriculum, thus presenting an immediate opportunity for
   educators to teach and encourage humanistic qualities of respect,
   empathy, and compassion. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to
   measure the impact of the Donor Luncheon, a unique program in which
   medical students meet the families of the anatomical donor prior to
   dissection in the anatomy course at the University of Oklahoma College
   of Medicine. Methods: Students were randomized into groups of 8 to
   attend the luncheon and either met with family of the donor or attended
   the luncheon with no donor family present. A questionnaire measured
   students' attitudes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and at the conclusion of the
   anatomy course. Results: Factor analysis revealed 5 scales. Analysis
   revealed statistically significant differences across time for Donor as
   Person, Dissection Process, and Donor as Patient and statistically
   significant differences between groups for Donor as Person and Donor as
   Patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that this program can
   provide students with the opportunity to maintain more humanistic
   attitudes at the beginning of their medical education career.}},

   Results. Nursing and pharmacy students had significantly more empathy
   than did law students. Third-year pharmacy students scored higher on
   empathy than did first-year pharmacy students, whereas the converse was
   true for nurses. There was no significant difference in empathy between
   first-and third-year law students. Across the study years, empathy
   increased among pharmacy students, decreased among nurses, and remained
   the same among law students. Women scored higher on empathy than did
   males.
   Conclusions. Empathy scores among university students vary depending on
   discipline and year of study.}},

Title = {{Characterizing changes in student empathy throughout medical school}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{305-311}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy is important in the physician-patient relationship.
   Prior studies suggest that medical student empathy declines with
   clinical training.
   Aims: We examined the trend of empathy longitudinally; determined
   differences in empathy according to gender and medical specialty
   preferences; and determined empathy and career preference differences
   among students admitted through different medical school admission
   pathways.
   Method: The data for this study were collected using a longitudinal
   cohort design and included 2652 observations nested within 1162
   individuals. Participants were medical students at a university-based
   medical school surveyed yearly from 2007 through 2010. Empathy was
   measured by the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version
   (JSPE-S), a validated, 20-item self-administered questionnaire.
   Predictors of JSPE-S scores included gender, age, anticipated financial
   debt upon graduation and future career interest.
   Results: Empathy scores of students in preclinical years were higher
   than in clinical years. Gender was a significant predictor of empathy,
   with women having higher empathy scores than men. Students preferring
   technology-oriented specialties had lower empathy scores. When career
   preference was controlled, higher levels of debt were significantly
   associated with greater empathy. Students with high baseline empathy
   decreased less than students with low baseline empathy during medical
   school. Students in traditional four-year medical school programs had
   higher baseline empathy than those in early pathway programs.
   Conclusions: Self-reported empathy for patients, a possibly critical
   factor in high-quality patient-centered care, wanes as students advance
   in clinical training, particularly among those entering
   technology-oriented specialties. In the era of new health care policy
   and primary care shortages, our research may have implications for the
   medical education system and admission policy.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{188-195}},
Abstract = {{Burnout is a psychological syndrome of emotional exhaustion,
   depersonalization, and impaired personal accomplishment induced by
   repeated workplace stressors. Current research suggests that physician
   burnout may have its origins in medical school. The consequences of
   medical student burnout include both personal and professional distress,
   loss of empathy, and poor health. We hypothesized that burnout occurs
   prior to the initiation of the clinical years of medical education. This
   was a cross-sectional survey administered to third-year medical students
   at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) in New York, New York (a
   traditional-style medical school with a marked division between
   pre-clinical and clinical training occurring at the beginning of the
   third year). Survey included an instrument used to measure job burnout,
   a sleep deprivation screen, and questions related to demographic
   information, current rotation, psychiatric history, time spent working/
   studying, participation in extracurricular activities, social support
   network, autonomy and isolation. Of the 86 medical students who
   participated, 71\% met criteria for burnout. Burnt out students were
   significantly more likely to suffer from sleep deprivation (p = 0.0359).
   They were also more likely to disagree with the following statements:
   ``I have control over my daily schedule'' (p = 0.0286) and ``I am
   confident that I will have the knowledge and skills necessary to become
   an intern when I graduate'' (p = 0.0263). Our findings show that burnout
   is present at the beginning of the third year of medical school, prior
   to the initiation of the clinical years of medical training. Medical
   student burnout is quite common, and early efforts should be made to
   empower medical students to both build the knowledge and skills
   necessary to become capable physicians, as well as withstand the
   emotional, mental, and physical challenges inherent to medical school.}},

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To measure changes in pharmacy and medical students' empathy
   scores after a 40-minute workshop during which students observed and
   discussed a theatrical performance about the challenges of aging.
   Methods. First-year pharmacy and medical students (n = 187 and n = 183,
   respectively) participating in the workshop observed and discussed a
   10-minute performance in which students enacted problems and concerns
   faced by elderly patients. The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) was
   administered just prior to the workshop (pretest), immediately afterward
   (posttest 1), and 7 or 26 days afterward (posttest 2).
   Results. Empathy increased significantly from pretest to posttest 1 for
   students of each profession (p < 0.01). Improvement in empathy scores
   declined by the time the JSE was readministered to pharmacy students 7
   days later and to medical students 26 days later (posttest 2). Similar
   patterns of improved and declining empathy were found when the data were
   analyzed by gender and medical student specialty interest (ie, primary
   vs non-primary care specialties).
   Conclusion. Empathy scores increased but were not sustained for both
   pharmacy and medical students after a brief workshop on aging that

Abstract = {{Background: Although medical student specialty choices shape the future
   of the healthcare workforce, factors influencing changes in specialty
   preference during training remain poorly understood.
   Aim: To explore if medical student distress and empathy predicts changes
   in students' specialty preference.
   Methods: A total of 858/1321 medical students attending five medical
   schools responded to surveys in 2006 and 2007. The survey included
   questions about specialty choice, burnout, depression, quality of life,
   and empathy.
   Results: A total of 26\% (205/799) changed their specialty preference
   over 1 year. Depersonalization - an aspect of burnout - was the only
   distress variable associated with change in specialty preference (OR,
   odds ratio 0.962 for each 1-point increase in score, p=0.03). Empathy at
   baseline and changes in empathy over the course of 1 year did not
   predict change in specialty preference (all p>0.05). On multi-variable
   analysis, being a third year (OR 1.92), being male (OR 1.48), and
   depersonalization score (OR 0.962 for each point increase) independently
   predicted a change in specialty preference. Distress and empathy did not
   independently predict students' losing interest in primary care whereas
   being a fourth-year student (OR 1.83) and being female (OR 1.83) did.
   Conclusion: Among those who did have a major change in their specialty
   preference, distress and empathy did not play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To find out the views of the patient on their participation
   in decision making (DM) when visiting their family physician.
   Design: A cross-sectional, qualitative and quantitative study.
   Setting and participants: Patients attending their family doctors in
   diverse geographical Health Centres.
   Measurements: Personal interviewing using different kinds of questions
   (close-ended, close-ended with options and open-ended questions).
   Results: Patients participation: 658 (52+/-17.4 years, 62\% females,
   consulting with 97 doctors (from urban centres: 36 (458); rural centres:
   22 (200). Most patients (94\%; 620) declared to be satisfied with DM and
   up to 41\% (266) thought that DM should be taken only by the doctor.
   Nevertheless, after the consultation 60\% of patients (360) confirmed
   that they would have liked the physician to have asked them for their
   opinion, but the doctor did not encourage them to do this. Furthermore,
   patients considered information, discussion about options, ways to make
   decisions, medical advice, active listening and empathy as key aspects
   to encourage them to participate.
   Conclusions: After a medical consultation, most patients wanted to give
   their opinion about the proposals of treatment. Nevertheless, they felt
   that their doctors offered them these opportunities on very few
   occasions. Some types of questions are better than others in detecting
   of these kinds of needs, and are more useful to design strategies for
   involving patients in the DM process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All

Abstract = {{Background: Short-term medical missions are common in medical
   educational settings and could possibly affect student learning. Little
   research has been conducted about the potential of these missions on
   students' transformative learning, in particular as it relates to
   empathy and multicultural awareness.
   Methods: Eight podiatric medical students who participated in short-term
   medical missions in 2008 and 2009 completed an electronic survey to
   investigate the effect of their experience as it relates to their
   learning. The empathy and multicultural awareness impact of the mission
   experience was emphasized. Qualitative questions in the survey were
   coded, themed, and triangulated with the quantitative responses.
   Results: Six students (75\%) ``strongly agreed{''} that participating in
   the medical mission was a significant positive experience in their
   podiatric medical training. Six students felt that their experiences in
   serving these communities increased their personal awareness of
   multicultural/diversity needs in general. All of the students agreed
   that they will become better podiatric physicians because of their
   experiences in the medical missions. The qualitative data also indicate
   that the experience had an effect on the students' views of health care
   and increased empathy toward their patients.
   Conclusions: Short-term medical missions could play a significant role
   in the transformative learning experience in podiatric medical
   education. This could affect the empathy and multicultural awareness of
   podiatric medical students. Further and more extensive evaluations of
   the potential impact of short-term medical missions in podiatric medical
   education should be explored because it could influence curriculum and
   global health in the field of podiatric medicine. (J Am Podiatr Med

Title = {{Verbal and non-verbal behavior of doctors and patients in primary care
   consultations - How this relates to patient enablement}},
Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-76}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the relationship between observable patient and
   doctor verbal and non-verbal behaviors and the degree of enablement in
   consultations according to the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) (a
   patient-reported consultation outcome measure).
   Methods: We analyzed 88 recorded routine primary care consultations.
   Verbal and non-verbal communications were analyzed using the Roter
   Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) and the Medical Interaction Process
   System, respectively. Consultations were categorized as patient- or
   doctor-centered and by whether the patient or doctor was verbally
   dominant using the RIAS categorizations.
   Results: Consultations that were regarded as patient-centered or
   verbally dominated by the patient on RIAS coding were considered
   enabling. Socio-emotional interchange (agreements, approvals, laughter,
   legitimization) was associated with enablement. These features, together
   with task-related behavior explain up to 33\% of the variance of
   enablement, leaving 67\% unexplained. Thus, enablement appears to
   include aspects beyond those expressed as observable behavior.
   Conclusion: For enablement consultations should be patient-centered and
   doctors should facilitate socio-emotional interchange. Observable
   behavior included in communication skills training probably contributes
   to only about a third of the factors that engender enablement in
   consultations.
   Practice implications: To support patient enablement in consultations,
   clinicians should focus on agreements, approvals and legitimization
   whilst attending to patient agendas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An empathic relationship between caregiver and patient not only defines
   the quality of the patient's experience as a recipient of care, it also
   contributes to patient outcomes. This longitudinal study was designed to
   examine changes in empathy during an academic year among undergraduate
   nursing students. Participants were 214 undergraduate nursing students
   who completed the Jefferson Scale of Empathy at the beginning and at the
   end of 2006-2007 academic year. Statistical analyses showed a
   statistically significant decline of empathy for nursing students who
   were exposed more than others to patient encounters during study period
   (F(2, 211)= 4.2, p < 0.01). Findings are consistent with those found
   among medical students in that nursing students' encounters with
   patients which ironically are supposed to strengthen empathic engagement
   have shown a decline in student empathy. Suggestions for improving
   empathic behaviors in nursing students are discussed.}},

   intelligence have on medical students? BEME Guide No. 17}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) is a type of social intelligence
   that involves monitoring, discriminating between and using emotions to
   guide thinking and actions. EI is related to interpersonal and
   communication skills, and is important in the assessment and training of
   medical undergraduates.
   Aim: This review aimed to determine the impact of structured educational
   interventions on the EI of medical students.
   Methods: We systematically searched 14 electronic databases and hand
   searched high yield journals. We looked at changes in EI and related
   behaviour of medical students, assessed using Kirkpatrick's hierarchy,
   provided they could be directly related to the content of the
   educational intervention.
   Results: A total of 1947 articles were reviewed, of which 14 articles
   met the inclusion criteria.
   Conclusions: The use of simulated patients is beneficial in improving EI
   when introduced in interventions later rather than earlier in
   undergraduate medical education. Regardless of duration of intervention,
   interventions have the best effects when delivered: (1) over a short
   space of time; (2) to students later in their undergraduate education
   and; (3) to female students. This should be taken into account when
   designing and delivering interventions. Emphasising the importance of
   empathetic qualities, such as empathetic communication style should be
   made explicit during teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To demonstrate a quantitative abstraction method for
   Communication Quality Assurance projects to assess physicians'
   communication about hidden emotions after newborn genetic screening.
   Design: Communication quality indicator analysis.
   Setting: Standardized parent encounters performed in practicing
   physicians' clinics or during educational workshops for residents.
   Participants: Fifty-nine pediatrics residents, 53 pediatricians, and 31
   family physicians.
   Intervention: Participants were asked to counsel standardized parents
   about a screening result; counseling was recorded, transcribed, and
   parsed into statements (each with 1 subject and 1 predicate). Pairs of
   abstractors independently compared statements with a data dictionary
   containing explicit-criteria definitions.
   Outcome Measures: Four groups of ``precautionary empathy{''} behaviors
   (assessment of emotion, anticipation/validation of emotion, instruction
   about emotion, and caution about future emotion), with definitions
   developed for both ``definite{''} and ``partial{''} instances.
   Results: Only 38 of 143 transcripts (26.6\%) met definite criteria for
   at least 1 of the precautionary empathy behaviors. When partial criteria
   were counted, this number increased to 80 of 143 transcripts (55.9\%).
   The most common type of precautionary empathy was the ``instruction
   about emotion{''} behavior (eg, ``don't be worried{''}), which may
   sometimes be leading or premature.
   Conclusions: Precautionary empathy behaviors were rare in this analysis.
   Further study is needed, but this study should raise concerns about the
   quality of communication services after newborn screening.}},
