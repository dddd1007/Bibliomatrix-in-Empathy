Abstract = {{Nonadherence to maintenance medication is common in paediatric chronic
   conditions. Despite the common belief that nonadherence is
   therapy-resistant, and the apparent lack of evidence for successful
   interventions to improve adherence, there is, in fact, a considerable
   body of evidence suggesting that adherence can be improved by applying
   specific communicative consultation skills. These can be summarized as
   the adherence equation: adherence = follow-up + dialogue + barriers and
   beliefs + empathy and education => concordance. Close follow-up of
   children with a chronic condition is needed to establish a therapeutic
   partnership with the family. Teaching self management skills is not a
   unidirectional process of providing information, but requires a
   constructive and collaborative dialogue between the medical team and the
   family. Identifying barriers to adherence can be achieved in a
   non-confrontational manner, by showing a genuine interest what the
   patient's views and preferences are. In particular, parental illness
   perceptions and medication beliefs should be identified, because they
   are strong drivers of nonadherence. Through empathic evidence-based
   education, such perceptions and beliefs can be modified. By applying
   these strategies, concordance between the child's family and the medical
   team can be achieved, resulting in optimal adherence to the jointly
   created treatment plan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To characterize gynecologic oncology patients' perceptions of
   the process of disclosure of a cancer diagnosis.
   METHODS: We surveyed 100 gynecologic oncology patients between December
   2011 and September 2012. An 83-item tool based on three validated
   assessment tools evaluated patient-centered factors, physician behavior
   and communication skills, and environmental factors. Associations
   between patients' satisfaction and these variables were analyzed using
   Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's rho tests. Poisson
   regression was used to assess factors associated with patient's
   satisfaction.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of patients were notified of their
   diagnosis by phone, 60\% in the physician's office, and 16\% in the
   hospital. Disclosure was performed by an obstetrician-gynecologist
   (58\%), gynecologic oncologist (26\%), primary care physician (8\%), or
   other (8\%). Fifty-two percent of all patients were accompanied by a
   support person. Higher patient satisfaction scores were associated with
   face-to-face disclosure (mean score 91\% compared with over the phone
   72\%, P=.02), a private setting (mean score 92\% compared with
   impersonal setting 72\%, P=.004), and duration of the encounter of
   greater than 10 minutes (mean score 94\% compared with less than 10
   minutes 79\%, P<.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that both
   physician communication skills (P<.001) and patient-centered factors
   (eg, perception of physician sensitivity and empathy, opportunities to
   ask questions and express emotion, and set the pace of conversation;
   P=.013) were associated with higher patient satisfaction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Effective physician communication skills and
   patient-centered factors resulted in higher patient satisfaction with
   the gynecologic cancer diagnosis disclosure experience.}},

Title = {{The Utility of Reflective Writing after a Palliative Care Experience:
   Can We Assess Medical Students' Professionalism?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1342-1349}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical education leaders have called for a curriculum that
   proactively teaches knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for
   professional practice and have identified professionalism as a
   competency domain for medical students. Exposure to palliative care
   (PC), an often deeply moving clinical experience, is an optimal trigger
   for rich student reflection, and students' reflective writings can be
   explored for professional attitudes. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate
   the merit of using student reflective writing about a PC clinical
   experience to teach and assess professionalism. Methods: After a PC
   patient visit, students wrote a brief reflective essay. We explored
   qualitatively if/how evidence of students' professionalism was reflected
   in their writing. Five essays were randomly chosen to develop a
   preliminary thematic structure, which then guided analysis of 30
   additional, randomly chosen essays. Analysts coded transcripts
   independently, then collaboratively, developed thematic categories, and
   selected illustrative quotes for each theme and subtheme. Results:
   Essays revealed content reflecting more rich information about students'
   progress toward achieving two professionalism competencies
   (demonstrating awareness of one's own perspectives and biases;
   demonstrating caring, compassion, empathy, and respect) than two others
   (displaying self-awareness of performance; recognizing and taking
   actions to correct deficiencies in one's own behavior, knowledge, and
   skill). Conclusions: Professional attitudes were evident in all essays.
   The essays had limited use for formal summative assessment of
   professionalism competencies. However, given the increasing presence of
   PC clinical experiences at medical schools nationwide, we believe this
   assessment strategy for professionalism has merit and deserves further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined perspectives regarding the use of empathy
   within medicine and developed a model to demonstrate the components of
   empathy in a medical setting.
   Methods: Grounded theory guided the methodology and final theory
   formation. Participants included 21 medical professionals representing
   multiple specialty areas and employed in a teaching hospital, private
   practice, or clinical setting in Eastern Virginia. Processes for
   transcription analysis and coding preserved participant perspectives and
   contributed to a final model.
   Results: Participant interviews revealed a seven-tier model that
   displays the facilitative conditions and potential barriers that may
   impact the full expression of empathy within the medical setting.
   Interviews also delineated between levels of empathy and described the
   benefits of providing empathic care, all of which are included in the
   final model.
   Conclusion: This new model of empathy describes a complex and dynamic
   process and conceptualizes ideal conditions for empathic treatment. The
   model presents concepts that may be useful in medical education, and
   creates new directions for empathy research.
   Practice implications: Physicians can assess themselves along each level
   of the model and can use it to identify barriers as well as ensure
   optimal conditions for empathic treatment. This new conceptualization of
   empathy also has implications for medical training and directions for
   future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Oncologists must have empathy when breaking bad news to
   patients who have incurable advanced cancer, and the level of empathy
   often depends on various individual characteristics. This study aimed to
   clarify the relationship between these characteristics and empathic
   behavior in Japanese oncologists.
   Methods: We videotaped consultations in which oncologists conveyed news
   of incurable advanced cancer to simulated patients. Oncologists'
   empathetic behaviors were coded, and regression analysis was performed
   to determine the existence of any relationships with factors such as
   age, sex, and specialism.
   Results: Sixty oncologists participated. In a multivariate model, only
   age was related to the empathy score (r = 0.406, p = 0.033); younger
   oncologists scored higher than did older oncologists.
   Conclusions: We found that empathic behaviors were more frequent in
   younger oncologists.

Abstract = {{Every pediatrician would want to satisfy their patients and their
   parents to sustain good practice, earn name and fame and simultaneously
   to avoid litigation in this era of consumer protection act. This can be
   achieved only by use of good communication skills. Today the patients
   demand time, information and want their questions to be answered. They
   expect politeness, empathy and human touch from doctors. Time
   constraints, arrogance, telephone calls, language barriers and cultural
   insensitivity are the important barriers to good communication. Research
   has shown that doctor, who undergoes training to acquire good
   communication skills, can better satisfy his patients. Good
   communication skill is an art which can be acquired or improved by
   putting conscious efforts in day to day practice. Such skills should
   also be incorporated as part of medical teaching curriculum. Asking open
   ended questions, effective listening, appropriate praise, providing
   enough information as part of advice and finally checking their
   understanding, are the key areas of communication during medical
   interview. During this process pediatrician should ensure to address the
   parental concerns, should empathize with parents and involve parents in
   decision making. This will not only ensure satisfaction of parents but
   also their adherence to the therapy and to the pediatrician.}},

Abstract = {{Providing care for patients and caring about patients should go hand in
   hand. Caring implicates our fundamental attitude towards patients, and
   our ability to convey kindness, compassion and respect. Yet all too
   often, patients and families experience health care as impersonal,
   mechanical; and quickly discover that patienthood trumps personhood. The
   consequences of a medical system organized around care rather than
   caring are considerable. Despite technical competence, patients and
   families are less satisfied with medical encounters when caring is
   lacking. Lack of empathy and emotional disengagement from patients
   typifies health care provider burnout. Caring is the gateway to
   disclosure; without it, patients are less likely to say what is
   bothering them, leading to missed diagnoses, medical errors and
   compromised patient safety. There are also liability issues, with most
   complaints levied against health care professionals stemming from
   failures in care tenor. Formal education for health care providers lacks
   a continued focus on achieving a culture of caring. If caring really
   matters, health care systems can insist on certain behaviors and impose
   certain obligations on health care providers to improve care tenor,
   empathy, and effective communication. Caregivers need to be engaged in
   looking at their own attitudes towards patients, their own
   vulnerability, their own fears and whatever else it is that shapes their
   tone of care. Health care professionals must set aside some time,
   supported by their institutions, to advance a culture of caring-now is
   the time to take action. (C) 2013 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

   to patients' outcomes has not been studied. This review aimed to
   systematically evaluate the evidence from prospective cohorts in primary
   care that measured patient-practitioner interactions with reference to
   patient outcomes. We carried out a systematic literature search and
   appraisal of study methodology. We extracted measures of affective and
   cognitive reassurance in consultations and their associations with
   consultation exit and follow-up measures of patients' outcomes. We
   identified 16 studies from 16,059 abstracts. Eight studies were judged
   to be high in methodological quality. Pooling could not be achieved as a
   result of heterogeneity of samples and measures. Affective reassurance
   showed inconsistent findings with consultation exit outcomes. In 3
   high-methodology studies, an association was found between affective
   reassurance and higher symptom burden and less improvement at follow-up.
   Cognitive reassurance was associated with higher satisfaction and
   enablement and reduced concerns directly after the consultations in 8
   studies; with improvement in symptoms at follow-up in 7 studies; and
   with reduced health care utilization in 3 studies. Despite limitations,
   there is support for the notion that cognitive reassurance is more
   beneficial than affective reassurance. We present a tentative model
   based on these findings and propose priorities for future research. (C)

Abstract = {{IntroductionEmpathy levels of health practitioners are related to
   patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes. The Toronto Composite
   Empathy Scale (TCES) was recently developed to assess cognitive and
   emotional empathy levels in both professional and personal spheres, and
   tested in an English-speaking sample of dental students. The aim of this
   study was to examine the psychometrics of the Greek version of the TCES.
   Materials and MethodsThe TCES was translated into Greek and administered
   to all of the dental students at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. A
   random subset of students completed the questionnaire twice for
   test-retest analysis.
   ResultsNearly all (96.5\%) of the students completed the questionnaire.
   The internal consistencies of each of the four subscales were generally
   acceptable (Cronbach's alphas: 0.676-0.805), and the scale showed good
   discriminant and convergent validities (r's for discriminant validity:
   0.217 and 0.103; r's for convergent validity: 0.595 and 0.700).
   Test-retest reliabilities ranged from 0.478 to 0.779. After eliminating
   items that fell on both cognitive and emotional factors, a rotated
   factor analysis indicated that the items loaded on two cognitive and
   three emotional factors.
   DiscussionOur results indicate that the Greek version of the TCES has
   good psychometric properties. The factor analysis indicates that the
   emotional and cognitive aspects of empathy are distinct, supporting the
   need to address both aspects in studies of empathy.
   ConclusionsThe Greek version of the TCES is a reliable and valid tool
   for the measurement of cognitive and emotional empathy, in both
   professional and personal life, in Greek dental students.}},

Title = {{A study of the effect of a visual arts-based program on the scores of

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The effect of visual arts interventions on development of
   empathy has not been quantitatively investigated. A study was conducted
   on the effect of a visual arts-based program on the scores of the
   Jefferson Scale for Physician Empathy (JSPE).
   Methods: A total of 110 clerks (n = 92) and first-year postgraduate
   residents (PGY1s) (n = 18) participating in the program were recruited
   into this study. The 4-hr program covered the subjects of learning to
   interpret paintings, interpreting paintings relating to medicine,
   illness and human suffering, the related-topics of humanitarianism and
   the other humanities fields and values and meaning. The JSPE was
   completed at the beginning (pretest) and the end (posttest) of the
   program.
   Results: There was no significant difference between the pretest and
   posttest JSPE scores. The average of the scores for the pretest was
   lower in the subgroup of PGY1s than the subgroup of clerks (p = 0.0358).
   An increased but not significantly mean posttest JESPE score was noted
   for the subgroup of PGY1s. Neither the females nor the males had higher
   posttest JSPE scores than the pretest scores.
   Conclusions: Although using a structured visual arts-based program as an
   intervention may be useful to enhance medical students' empathy, our
   results failed to show a positive effect on the JSPE Scores for a group
   of clerks and PGY1s. This suggests that further experimental studies are
   needed if quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of visual-arts
   based programs on empathy is to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the significant clinical and economic burden of hand
   dermatitis, data on patients' satisfaction with treatment and related
   determining factors are lacking.
   Patients and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using a
   standardized survey, including all patients with hand dermatitis treated
   between 12/2001 and 11/2008 at the Department of Dermatology, TU
   Dresden. Patients were asked about socio-demographic data, disease
   characteristics, occupational data, quality of life, treatment
   satisfaction and their treatment goals. Based on an a priori model,
   possible impact factors on treatment satisfaction were analyzed using
   regression modeling.
   Results: Of 382 contacted patients, 215 agreed to participate in the
   study (133 {[}61.3 \%] female). The mean age was 42 years. 155 patients
   (72.1 \%) had had severe or very severe hand dermatitis in the past. The
   majority of the patients were satisfied with the medical treatment.
   Treatment satisfaction was determined by the impression of professional
   competence (p < 0.001), physicians' empathy (p < 0.001), sufficient
   information on course, prognosis, and treatment options (p < 0.001), the
   patients' self-treatment competency (p < 0.001), quality of life (p =
   0.007), as well as on the severity of hand dermatitis (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The data point out that in the therapy of chronic hand
   dermatitis, along with professional competence, the physicians' empathy,
   provision of sufficient information about the disease, and teaching
   self-treatment competency play a prominent role in improving the
   treatment satisfaction of the patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:The aim of the present study was to investigate second-year
   medical students' understanding of quality of life associated with
   childhood inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Methods:A cross-sectional
   study in a major teaching institution in San Francisco was carried out.
   A questionnaire was administered following an hour-long gastroenterology
   lecture, which featured 2 young patients with pediatric-onset IBD who
   addressed everyday life with the disease. Analyses of numerate responses
   to the questionnaire were paired with a content and thematic analysis of
   audiotape recordings of the patients' commentaries.Results:Medical
   students' responses to the patient interviews were extremely positive.
   Medical students gained a new awareness of the psychosocial complexities
   associated with living with a pediatric chronic illness and a new way of
   thinking about the meaning of healthy. Despite listening to 2 healthy
   young patients, however, the medical students still conceptualized
   pediatric IBD in mostly, although not exclusively, negative
   terms.Conclusions:Medical students' perceptions of pediatric IBD
   improved as a result of listening to the patient interviews. Although
   this teaching modality effectively introduced students to a complex
   condition, it did not overcome their unfavorable impression of the
   effect of IBD on children's lives. The symptoms associated with IBD have
   stigma attached to them, and these stereotypes influence how medical
   students perceive those living with this chronic illness. More research
   and training in this area is necessary.}},

Title = {{Facilitators and barriers to initiating change in medical intensive care

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Alcohol abuse and dependence are collectively referred to as
   alcohol use disorders (AUD). An AUD is present in up to one third of
   patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). We sought to
   understand the barriers and facilitators to change in ICU survivors with
   an AUD to provide a foundation upon which to tailor alcohol-related
   interventions.
   Methods: We used a qualitative approach with a broad constructivist
   framework, conducting semistructured interviews in medical ICU survivors
   with an AUD. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 2
   medical ICUs and were excluded if they refused participation, were
   unable to participate, or did not speak English. Digitally recorded and
   professionally transcribed interviews were analyzed using a general
   inductive approach and grouped into themes.
   Results: Nineteen patients were included, with an average age of 51
   (interquartile range, 36-51) years and an average Acute Physiology and
   Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 9 (interquartile range, 5-13);
   68\% were white, 74\% were male, and the most common reason for
   admission was alcohol withdrawal (n = 8). We identified 5 facilitators
   of change: empathy of the inpatient health care environment, recognition
   of accumulating problems, religion, pressure from others to stop
   drinking, and trigger events. We identified 3 barriers to change: missed
   opportunities, psychiatric comorbidity, and cognitive dysfunction.
   Social networks were identified as either a barrier or facilitator to
   change depending on the specific context.
   Conclusions: Alcohol-related interventions to motivate and sustain
   behavior change could be tailored to ICU survivors by accounting for
   unique barriers and facilitators. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate how patient, clinician and relationship
   characteristics may predict how oncologists and nurses respond to
   patients' emotional expressions.
   Methods: Observational study of audiotapes of 196 consultations in
   cancer care. The consultations were coded according to Verona Coding
   Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES). Associations were tested
   in multi-level analyzes.
   Results: There were 471 cues and 109 concerns with a mean number of 3.0
   (SD = 3.2) cues and concerns per consultation. Nurses in admittance
   interviews were five times more likely to provide space for further
   disclosure of cues and concerns (according to VR-CoDES definitions) than
   oncologists in outpatient follow-up consultations. Oncologists gave more
   room for disclosure to the first cue or concern in the consultation, to
   more explicit and doctor initiated cues/concerns and when the doctor
   and/or patient was female. Nurses gave room for further disclosure to
   explicit and nurse initiated cues/concerns, but the effects were smaller
   than for oncologists.
   Conclusion: Responses of clinicians which provide room for further
   disclosure do not occur at random and are systematically dependent on
   the source, explicitness and timing of the cue or concern. Practice
   implications: Knowledge on which factors influence responses to cues and
   concerns may be useful in communication skills training. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Assessment of students' attitudes towards physicians' empathy is
   essential in medical education and in practice because empathy is vital
   in physician-patient communication. To cross-culturally adapt the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (S-version, JSPE-S) into a German
   version, examine its psychometric properties in comparison to the
   original US version (psychometric equivalence), and to compare the level
   of attitude towards empathy to the original US version and to other
   cultural adaptations. The German version was administered to the 2010
   2nd year medical students cohort at the Medical University of Vienna,
   Austria (n = 516). Item-total score correlations were all positive.
   Reliability was high (Cronbach's alpha = .82); a 6-7 weeks test-retest
   correlation for a subsample was .45. In an explanatory factor analysis,
   a four-factor solution emerged and is akin to published results of the
   original JSPE-S. This study provides an example of successful
   cross-cultural adaptation of an assessment instrument. The German
   adaptation of the JSPE at hand will pave the way for future
   international research regarding the concept of empathy and its
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT In light of the call for humanistic caring in the contemporary
   health care system globally and in China, the issue of improving the
   caring skills that are essential to student success, high-quality
   nursing practice and positive patient outcomes is at the forefront of
   nursing education.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this mixed-methods quantitative and qualitative
   study was to investigate baccalaureate nursing students' caring ability
   in the context of China and to explore the role of clinical practice
   learning in the development of students' caring skills.
   METHODS A two-phase, descriptive study utilising a mixed methodology
   consisting of a caring ability survey and focus group interviews was
   conducted. In the quantitative phase, 598 baccalaureate nursing students
   at two colleges in Yunnan Province in southwest China were surveyed
   using the Caring Ability Inventory (CAI). In the qualitative phase, 16
   of the students who had participated in the quantitative phase were
   interviewed.
   RESULTS Students obtained lower scores on the CAI than have been
   reported elsewhere by other researchers. In addition, students in the
   clinical stage of training scored lower than students in the
   pre-clinical stage. Three themes concerning facilitation by and three
   themes concerning the obstructive effects of clinical practice learning
   in the development of caring ability were identified. Themes pertaining
   to facilitation were: (i) promoting a sense of professional
   responsibility and ethics; (ii) providing an arena in which to practise
   caring, and (iii) learning from positive role models. Themes pertaining
   to obstruction were: (i) a critical practice learning environment; (ii)
   encountering inappropriate clinical teachers, and (iii) experiencing
   shock at the contrast between an idealised and the real environment.
   CONCLUSIONS The key to developing students' ability to care lies in
   highlighting caring across the entire health care system. By diminishing
   exposure to negative role models, and adopting appropriate pedagogical
   ideas about education in caring, such as truth telling and helping
   students to think in a critical manner, educators can help students to
   improve their caring ability.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT PAIN AND HEADACHE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{One of the most controversial issues in the management of patients in a
   vegetative state or a minimally conscious state concerns their
   hypothetical capacity to continue to experience pain despite an apparent
   absence of self- and environmental awareness. Recent functional
   neuroimaging studies have shown a greater perception of pain in patients
   in minimally conscious state compared with patients in vegetative state,
   suggesting the possible involvement of preserved cognitive mechanisms in
   the process of pain modulation in the former. In addition, a subgroup of
   patients might continue to experience some elementary emotional and
   affective feelings, as suggested by the reported activation of specific
   cerebral areas in response to situations, which commonly generate
   empathy. However, the available evidence is not sufficient to draw
   conclusions about the presence or absence of pain experience in patients
   with disorders of consciousness. Future studies should contribute to a
   better understanding of which central neural pathways are involved in
   the perception and modulation of pain in healthy subjects and in
   patients with severe brain injuries. Such studies should thus also
   improve our know-how about pain management in this particularly
   challenging group of patients.}},

   differences by gender and year of medical education}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: In recent years in China, the tense physician-patient
   relationship has been an outstanding problem. Empathy is one of the
   fundamental factors enhancing the therapeutic effects of
   physician-patient relationships and is significantly associated with
   clinical and academic performance among students.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study used the JSPE-S (The Student Version
   of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy) to assess 902 medical
   students from 1st year to 4th year at China Medical University. The
   reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach's alpha
   coefficient. We performed an exploratory factor analysis to evaluate the
   construct validity of the JSPE-S. Group comparisons of empathy scores
   were conducted via the t-test and one-way ANOVA. Statistic analysis was
   performed by SPSS 13.0.
   Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.83. The three factors
   emerging in the factor analysis of the JSPE-S are ``perspective
   taking{''}, ``compassionate care{''} and ``ability to stand in patients'
   shoes{''}, which accounted for 48.00\%. The mean empathy score was
   109.60. The empathy score of medical students had significant
   differences between different genders (p < 0.05) and academic year level
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This study provided support for the validity and
   reliability of the Chinese translated version of the JSPE-S for medical
   students. Early exposure to clinical training and a curriculum for
   professional competencies help to enhance the empathy of medical
   students. We suggest that the curriculum within Chinese medical schools
   include more teaching on empathy and communicational skills.}},

Abstract = {{The Institute of Medicine defines patient-centered care as providing
   care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient
   preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide
   all clinical decisions. What is missing in this definition is an
   explicit emphasis on compassion. This perspective article draws on the
   experience of Planetree (CT, USA), a not-for-profit organization that
   partners with healthcare establishments to drive adoption of
   patient-centered care principles and practices by connecting healthcare
   professionals with the voices and perspectives of the patients and
   family members who utilize their services. Across hundreds of focus
   groups facilitated by Planetree, patients and their loved ones emphasize
   that paramount among their needs, preferences and values are
   compassionate human interactions. For care to be truly patient-centered,
   a foundation of compassion is essential. Reports from patients and the
   media, and research from healthcare systems around the world demonstrate
   the fallacy of assuming that compassion is a current or prevalent
   feature of the care experience. Concurrently, a growing evidence base
   highlights the supreme importance of compassion in driving high-quality,
   high-value care. However, good intentions are not sufficient for
   delivering compassionate care. Drawing on the experiences of exemplary
   patient-centered hospitals (recognized as such following a rigorous
   culture audit to determine fulfillment of the criteria for formal
   recognition as a Designated (R) Patient-Centered Hospital
   {[}Planetree]), this paper explores practical approaches for embedding
   compassion in healthcare delivery and organizational culture to meet
   patients expressed desires for empathic and respectful human
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In 2002 the American Medical Student Association (AMSA)
   created a fourth-year medical student elective known as the Humanistic
   Elective in alternative medicine, Activism, and Reflective
   Transformation (HEART) that provided the opportunity for students to
   explore humanism in medicine, self-care, complementary and alternative
   medicine modalities, communication, activism, and community building in
   a four-week immersion experience. The educational effects of this
   elective, and whether it has met its stated goals, are unknown.
   Method: The authors conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey of the
   first eight cohorts of HEART graduates in 2010. Survey questions
   assessed respondents' demographics and perspectives on the educational
   impact of the elective. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize
   the sample and qualitative analyses were guided by grounded theory.
   Results: Of 168 eligible alumni, 122 (73\%) completed the survey. The
   majority were female (70\%), age <= 35 (77\%) years, and trained in
   primary care specialties (66\%). Half were attendings in practice. The
   majority of respondents felt the elective taught professionalism (89\%)
   and communication skills (92\%) well or very well. The majority highly
   agreed that the elective helped them better cope with stress during
   residency training (80\%), taught them self-care skills (75\%), and
   improved their ability to empathize and connect with patients (71\%).
   Qualitative analysis of the personal and professional impact of the
   elective identified twelve common themes with self-discovery, self-care,
   and collegial development/community most frequently cited.
   Conclusions: The majority of HEART graduates endorse learning important
   skills and benefiting from the experience both personally and
   professionally. Aspects of the HEART curriculum may help training
   programs teach professionalism and improve trainee well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Professional capabilities, such as empathy and
   patient-centeredness, decline during medical education. Reflective
   practice is advocated for teaching these capabilities. The Clinical
   Reflection Training (CRT) is a reflective practice intervention using
   the professional dilemmas faced by medical students during clinical
   practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate students' perceptions of
   the helpfulness of the CRT and its effects on their medical education.
   Methods: Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with medical
   students who had participated in the CRT. Content analysis was used to
   analyze the interview data.
   Results: Medical students did not feel adequately prepared to manage the
   difficult personal and interpersonal problems frequently encountered in
   clinical practice. They reported that the CRT reduces stress, improves
   patient care and serves as a tool for professional development.
   Conclusion: The CRT may be a useful tool for developing professionalism
   during medical education, reducing stress and enhancing the quality of
   patient care.
   Practice implications: Providing students with reflective practice
   training that draws on their current personal clinical problems in order
   to improve their clinical work may be a productive investment in
   personal professional development, physician health, and quality
   improvement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Surgeons General, the Institute of Medicine,
   and others have called for physicians to be role models for meeting the
   obesity epidemic. There are few published reports describing
   undergraduate medical education obesity curriculum elements. Physician
   experiences, knowledge, and attitudes have been shown to affect patient
   counseling behavior of physicians.
   METHODS: Required and extra credit obesity educational interventions
   were designed for third-year family medicine clerkship. For extra
   credit, students completed a personal weight management experience that
   spanned at least 4 weeks, included calculations of body mass index
   (BMI), waist circumference, caloric needs, description of eating and
   physical activity and monitoring plan, and a final report and
   reflection.
   RESULTS: During 2011-2012, 72\% of the students completed this extra
   credit activity with almost all losing or maintaining their weight. Most
   reflected gratitude for this opportunity and their increased empathy for
   patients as they struggle with weight issues.
   CONCLUSIONS: Medical students completing a weight management experience
   during their third-year clerkship can see the effects on their own
   health while developing empathy for and understanding of the weight
   management struggles of their patients. Minimal faculty time commitment
   is required.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce suicides among Veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs
   (VA) has designated suicide risk assessments for Veterans who screen
   positive for depression or post-traumatic stress disorder as a national
   performance goal. Many VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) are using brief
   suicidal ideation screens, administered in non-mental health ambulatory
   care settings, as the first step in the assessment process.
   To explore Veterans' perceptions of the suicide screening and risk
   assessment process, the barriers and facilitators to disclosing suicidal
   thoughts, and perceptions of possible consequences of revealing suicidal
   thoughts.
   Investigators recorded one semi-structured interview with each Veteran.
   Transcripts were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach.
   Thirty-four Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)
   Veterans who screened positive for suicidal ideation in non-mental
   health ambulatory care settings in 2009 and 2010.
   Veterans accepted the need to assess suicide risk. They increasingly
   experienced attempts to suppress and avoid thoughts of suicide as
   burdensome and exhausting. Despite this, Veterans often failed to
   disclose severe and pervasive suicidal thoughts when screened because:
   (1) they considered suicidal thoughts as shameful and a sign of
   weakness; (2) they believed suicidal thoughts were private and not to be
   divulged to strangers; (3) they worried that disclosure would lead to
   unwanted hospitalization or medication recommendations; and (4) the
   templated computer reminder process was perceived as perfunctory and
   disrespectful. In contrast, admitting and discussing thoughts of suicide
   with a health provider who focused on building a relationship,
   demonstrated genuineness and empathy, offered information on the
   rationale for suicide risk assessment, and used straightforward and
   understandable language, all promoted trust that resulted in more honest
   disclosure of suicidal thoughts.
   In ambulatory care settings, both provider behaviors and system
   modifications may lead to more honest disclosure of suicidal thoughts.

Title = {{Bearing witness: Midwives experiences of witnessing traumatic birth}},
Journal = {{MIDWIFERY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1056-1063}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: traumatic birth is a phenomenon that has been identified in
   women's birthing experiences, yet there has been no primary research
   conducted into midwives experiences of witnessing traumatic birth.
   Traumatic stress from witnessing and working with traumatised clients
   has been identified in other caring professionals such as nurses, social
   workers and emergency department personnel. This includes evidence of
   posttraumatic stress disorder, secondary traumatic stress, vicarious
   traumatisation and compassion fatigue. A distinct gap in the literature
   about midwives experiences of witnessing traumatic birth and the effects
   of working with potentially traumatised women formed the basis for this
   research.
   Research design and method: a descriptive qualitative study was used to
   explore midwives experiences of witnessing traumatic birth. The aim of
   this research was to enable midwives to describe their experiences and
   to determine if they are at risk of negative psychological sequalae
   similar to those in other caring professions. Ten currently or
   previously Registered Midwives with varying amounts of experience were
   interviewed, and transcripts of those interviews formed the raw data for
   the study. The data were independently thematically analysed by the two
   authors to identify common themes used to describe the experience of
   witnessing traumatic birth.
   Results: `Stuck between two philosophies', `What could I have done
   differently', and `Feeling for the woman', emerged as the main themes
   from the research. The participants described their emotional distress
   from feeling `stuck' between wishing they could practice according to
   their midwifery philosophy, and the reality of working within a medical
   model of care. Feelings of responsibility for women and babies'
   outcomes, and repeatedly questioning what they could have done
   differently to prevent a traumatic birth was also reported. Feeling for
   the woman emerged as a major factor in midwives' experiences of
   witnessing traumatic birth.
   Conclusions: as far as we can determine this is the first study to
   explicitly examine the phenomenon of midwives witnessing traumatic birth
   from the midwives point of view. While it was anticipated that midwives
   might describe being emotionally distressed by their experiences, the
   extent of their empathy and feelings of being stuck between two
   philosophies provide new knowledge into what affects midwives when
   working with birthing women. Further research into these areas is
   warranted. Better understanding of how witnessing traumatic birth
   impacts on midwives and what kind of support after these experiences is
   required to ensure midwives are equipped to cope when witnessing
   traumatic birth. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Writing letters to patients as an educational tool for medical students}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite rapid growth and development of medical technology,
   personal relationship between the patient and physician remains the
   basis of high quality treatment. The aim of our study was to develop,
   implement and evaluate patient therapeutic letters written by students
   as a tool in teaching family medicine.
   Methods: The study included all 6th year students attending their rounds
   in family medicine, structured into two 10-day cycles, one in urban
   offices and one in offices on the Adriatic islands (rural). After
   receiving detailed instructions, students wrote letters to two patients
   after a consultation in the office. The letters were audited by patients
   and 3 family medicine experts who used a grading instrument (scale 0
   -poor, 1 - medium, 2 - good) for 1) adequacy and clarity of description
   of patients' disease/state, 2) knowledge, 3) adequacy of
   recommendations, 4) courtesy and respect and 5) language and style.
   Patients and experts were also asked to underline phrases they thought
   would be difficult to understand; the underlined text was subjected to
   content analysis.
   Results: Both the patients and the experts gave high scores for the
   value and quality of the letters in terms of the description of the
   problem, adequacy of recommendations given, and courtesy and respect
   (mean (+/-standard deviation) 5.65 +/- 0.79 for patients vs. 4.87 +/-
   0.79 for experts out of maximum score of 6). Family medicine experts
   were stricter than patients in their evaluation of the content of the
   letters (adequacy and clarity of disease description (P < 0.001) and
   adequacy of recommendations (P < 0.001). Both the patients and the
   experts seemed to like longer letters as the length of the letter showed
   significant positive correlation with the quality summary score
   (correlation r = 0.492 vs. r = 0.338, respectively, P < 0.010).
   Overlapping of the text underlined as difficult to understand by
   patients and experts was found in 10 (11.6\%) out of 86 letters. The
   highest overlap (20 terms) was found for the category ``Technical terms
   unclear to a lay reader{''}.
   Conclusions: Writing of a letter to their first patients may be a useful
   tool for students to personally experience the practice of medicine and
   establish better partnership with patients in health care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Rates of depression among medical students have been shown
   to be high and related to year of study and other factors. We report on
   cluster of symptoms related to depression and their association with
   other difficulties in specific domains.
   Methods: 481 (Response rate=79.8\%) medical students completed a
   questionnaire about areas of difficulty in the medical school (studies,
   leisure, colleagues, professors, and patients), and Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI). We studied correlation among areas of difficulty and
   clusters of BDI along with year in the course.
   Results: Two areas which contributed most difficulty were studies and
   leisure. The significant associations for studies were seen between
   somatic cluster of depressive symptoms and the level of the course.
   Difficulties associated with leisure activities and with colleagues were
   correlated with the affective cluster of symptoms of depression.
   Activities related to clinical matters especially working with patients
   in the internship year were associated with somatic clusters. The
   different associations confirmed that rather than relying on scores
   emphasis should be placed on clusters of symptoms.
   Limitations: Sample from a single medical school.
   Conclusions: Although the clusters are associated with specific
   difficulties, it is important that educators and health professionals
   are aware of streesors the medical students face. The correlations if
   confirmed in future studies with qualitative factors could guide the
   development of more specific therapeutic or curriculum interventions.

Abstract = {{Purpose Some research shows that empathy declines during medical school.
   The authors conducted an updated, systematic review of the literature on
   empathy-enhancing educational interventions in undergraduate medical
   education.
   Method The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus,
   and Web of Science (January 1, 2004 through March 19, 2012) using key
   words related to undergraduate medical education and empathy. They
   independently selected and reviewed all English-language articles that
   described an educational intervention designed to promote empathy in
   medical students, assessing the quality of the quantitative studies
   using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).
   Results The authors identified and reviewed the full texts of 18
   articles (15 quantitative and 3 qualitative studies). Included
   interventions used one or more of the followingpatient narrative and
   creative arts (n = 7), writing (n = 3), drama (n=1), communication
   skills training (n = 4), problem-based learning (n = 1),
   interprofessional skills training (n = 1), patient interviews (n = 4),
   experiential learning (n = 2), and empathy-focused training (n = 1).
   Fifteen articles reported significant increases in empathy. Mean effect
   size was 0.23. Mean MERSQI scorewas 10.13 (range 6.5-14).
   Conclusions These findings suggest that educational interventions can be
   effective in maintaining and enhancing empathy in undergraduate medical
   students. In addition, they highlight the need for multicenter,
   randomized controlled trials, reporting long-term data to evaluate the
   longevity of intervention effects. Defining empathy remains problematic,
   and the authors call for conceptual clarity to aid future research.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a relevant attribute in the context of patient care. However,
   a decline in empathy throughout medical education has been reported in
   North-American medical schools, particularly, in the transition to
   clinical training. The present study aims to longitudinally model
   empathy during medical school at three time points: at the entrance,
   final of pre-clinical phase and at the beginning of clinical training.
   Data collected with the adaptation to Portuguese of the Jefferson Scale
   of Physician Empathy (student version) were analysed with latent growth
   modelling, conditioned by gender, openness and agreeableness. Empathy
   scores at all times were higher for females than for males, but only
   significantly at the end of the preclinical phase. The model showed a
   satisfactory fit level and the primary finding was that undergraduate
   medical student's empathy did not decline over time. Empathy scores were
   significantly and positively related with Openness to Experience and
   Agreeableness at admission, but the empathy rate of change across time
   was not significant. The stability of empathy revealed by a longitudinal
   methodology applied for the first time to empathy studying, contradicts
   previous results of decline and contributes to the understanding of the
   empathy development of medical students.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Treatment at home during the pancytopenic phase after
   allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been an
   option for patients at our center since 1998. Earlier studies have shown
   that home care is safe and has medical advantages. In this study, we
   present patients' experiences of care and support while being treated in
   hospital or at home during the acute post-transplantation phase.
   Method: Patients (n = 41, 22 in hospital care and 19 in home care)
   answered the SAUC questionnaire at discharge (when home, or from
   hospital). Both statistical analysis and deductive content analysis were
   used.
   Results: The patients were highly satisfied with the care and support
   during the acute post-transplantation phase. Patients in home care were
   found to be more satisfied with care in general than patients in
   hospital care. The importance of safety, empathy, and encouragement from
   healthcare staff were expressed regardless of where care was given.
   Patients also felt that receipt of continuous, updated information
   during treatment was important and they had a strong belief in HSCT but
   were uncertain of the future regarding recovery.
   Conclusions: The main findings of this study were that in comparison to
   hospital care, home care does not appear to have a significant negative
   effect on patients' experiences of care and support during the acute
   post-transplantation phase. In addition patients in home care felt safe,
   seen as a person and encouragement seem to empower the patients at home.
   Thus, this study may encourage other transplantation centers to provide
   home care if the patients want it. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives Health care disparities represent a major issue impacting the
   quality of care in the USA. Provider biases have been identified as
   contributing to health care disparities. This study examined the helping
   intentions and biases reported by medical students based on patient race
   and perceived patient responsibility. The study was guided by the
   responsibility-affect-helping model (RAHM), which proposes that helping
   behaviour is a function of perceived responsibility and affect.
   Methods In a 2x3 online experiment, medical students (n=231) viewed a
   health chart and dialogue for either a Black or a White patient, in
   which the dialogue included a manipulation of the patient's rationales
   for his non-compliance with diet recommendations (responsible, not
   responsible, no responsibility assigned). After viewing the
   manipulation, medical students completed measures regarding perceived
   patient responsibility, affect, intention to help, perceptions of the
   patient and ethnocentrism.
   Results The RAHM was supported, such that increased perceived patient
   responsibility led to increased provider anger and reduced provider
   helping intentions, whereas decreased perceived patient responsibility
   led to increased provider empathy and helping intentions. Additionally,
   an interaction effect between race and perceived patient responsibility
   occurred such that bias toward the Black patient was most likely to
   occur in the control condition.
   Conclusions Perceived patient responsibility affects provider helping
   intentions and interacts with patient race to influence provider
   perceptions of patient characteristics. Communication on rationales for
   non-compliance as associated with perceived responsibility may lead to
   better or worse patient care as providers make attributions about
   patients based on these factors.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{824-831}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Most medical schools focus upon aspects of interpersonal
   functioning such as empathy in the doctor-patient relationship with the
   aim of training clinically competent doctors. This study investigated
   the relationship between empathy and clinical competence among medical
   students.
   Methods Fifty-seven medical students participated in the study. Clinical
   competence was assessed in an objective structured clinical examination
   (OSCE). Empathy was rated by an independent observer of the clinical
   interaction in OSCE stations. In addition, empathy was self-rated using
   the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student Version.
   Results Observed behaviour indicative of empathy, as rated objectively
   by an independent observer, was strongly associated with clinical
   competence. The strong association between the behavioural manifestation
   of empathy and clinical competence was evident across a range of medical
   conditions and types of consultation. In addition, observable empathy
   was strongly associated with patients' ratings of the students'
   performances. Self-rated empathy, however, was not associated with
   clinical competence. Significant differences in mean total competence
   scores were noted between students low in observed empathy (mean +/-
   standard deviation {[}SD]: 165.86 +/- 12.92) and students high in
   observed empathy (mean +/- SD: 190.35 +/- 14.00) (t{[}55]=6.28, p=0.000,
   0.01).
   Conclusions In medical education, strategies that enhance the
   behavioural expression of empathy (or at least retard its decay) could
   help to make medical students appear to be more clinically competent to
   both examiners and patients. However, if medical students' internal
   emotions are found to be discrepant with their behaviour, these findings
   will raise difficult questions regarding the fundamental nature of
   genuine empathy and alert us to the possibility that medical students
   may learn that it pays to subscribe to the view that if a person does
   not feel empathy, he or she can fake it.}},

Title = {{A year in transition: a qualitative study examining the trajectory of
   first year residents' well-being}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is generally understood that trainees experience periods
   of heightened stress during first year residency, yet there is little
   information on variations in stress and well-being over the transition
   period or those factors that contribute to these variations. This
   qualitative study explored the trajectory of well-being described by
   first year residents in the context of challenges, supports and
   adaptations over time.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face with 17 first
   year residents at the University of Toronto. Participants drew a graph
   of their well-being over the course of their first year and described
   critical periods of challenge and adaptation. Interviews were
   audio-taped and transcribed. Results were organized into a thematic
   analysis using NVivo software.
   Results: Residents described a pattern of well-being that varied in
   accordance with changes in rotations. Wellbeing increased when residents
   perceived high levels of team support, felt competent and experienced
   valued learning opportunities. Well-being decreased with low team
   support, heavy work demands, few learning opportunities and poor
   orientations. Anxiety and excitement in the beginning of the year gave
   way to heightened confidence but increased fatigue and apathy towards
   the year's end. Residents used a number of cognitive, behavioural and
   self-care strategies to cope with transitional challenges.
   Conclusions: Residents experienced a pattern of highly fluctuating
   well-being that coincided with changes in rotations. Residents'
   well-being varied according to levels of supervisor and colleague
   support, learning opportunities, and work demands. Residents' well-being
   may be improved by program interventions that facilitate better team and
   supervisory supports, maintain optimal service to learning ratios,
   establish effective fatigue and risk management systems, offer wellness
   support services and integrate skills based resiliency training into the
   curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{Research investigating the effects of attitude-focused interventions on
   doctors' and medical students' attitudes toward older adults has
   produced mixed results. The objective of this systematic review was to
   determine whether factors pertaining to study design and quality might
   provide some explanation of this inconclusive picture. Articles were
   judged of interest if they reported doctors' or medicals students'
   attitude scores before and after a geriatric-focused intervention.
   Articles that did not report the measure used, mean scores, or
   inferential statistics were excluded. Twenty-seven databases, including
   Medline, PsychInfo, and Embase, were searched through April 2011 using a
   systematic search strategy. After assessment and extraction, 27 studies
   met the eligibility criteria for this review. These studies demonstrated
   inconsistent results; 14 appeared successful in effecting positive
   attitude change toward older adults after an intervention, and 13
   appeared unsuccessful. Attitude change results differed in line with the
   content of the intervention. Of the 27 studies, 11 interventions
   contained solely knowledge-building content. Three of these studies
   demonstrated positive changes in doctors' or medical students' attitudes
   toward older adults after the intervention. The remaining 16
   interventions incorporated an empathy-building component, such as an
   aging simulation exercise or contact with a healthy older adult. Of
   these, 11 successfully demonstrated positive attitude change after the
   intervention. The inclusion of an empathy-building task in an
   intervention appears to be associated with positive attitude change in
   medical students' and doctors' attitudes toward older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Physician-patient email communication is increasing but
   trainees receive no education on this communication medium. Research
   eliciting patient preferences about email communication could inform
   training. Investigators elicited parents' perspectives on
   physician-parent email communication and compared parent and faculty
   assessments of medical students' emails.
   Methods: This mixed methods study explored physician-parent email
   communication in 5 parent focus groups using qualitative analyses to
   identify themes. Differences between faculty and parent assessment
   scores for students' email responses were calculated using univariate
   general linear modeling.
   Results: Themes that emerged were: (1) Building the Relationship, (2)
   Clarity of Communication and (3) Expectations. Parents criticized
   student's statements as condescending. The sum of assessment scores by
   parents and faculty were moderately correlated (r(44) = .407, P < .01),
   but parents gave students lower scores on ``acknowledges
   validity/expresses empathy{''} (P = .01) and higher scores on ``provides
   next steps{''} (P < .01) and ``identifies issues{''} (P < .01).
   Conclusion: Parents place value on students' abilities to communicate
   clearly and convey respect and empathy in email. Parent and faculty
   perspectives on email communication are similar but not the same.
   Practice implications: Differences between parental and faculty
   assessments of medical students' emails supports the need for the
   involvement of patients and families in email communication curriculum

Abstract = {{Background: Medical students struggle with varied stressors and
   developing adequate coping mechanisms is essential. Purpose: This study
   examined medical student perceptions of the well-being impact of a
   theatre-based course. Methods: Eighteen 1st-year medical students at the
   University of Alberta participated in 3 focus groups following the
   conclusion of a theatre-based module that was piloted in the first
   quarter of 2010. A semistructured protocol was used to guide the focus
   groups, which were audiotaped and transcribed. Along with general
   feedback, impact on personal development and student well-being were
   discussed. Thematic aspects of these discussions were qualitatively
   analyzed. Findings: During the focus groups, medical students identified
   three aspects of the theatre-based module that contributed to their
   sense of overall well-being. These included (a) fun/relaxation, (b)
   enhanced relationships with each other, and (c) personal
   growth/resilience. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that participating
   in an optional theatre module can enhance medical student well-being.
   Our analysis suggests the need to consider novel, humanities-based
   curriculum offerings in relation to personal development and well-
   being.}},

Abstract = {{Context Although doctor-patient communication is considered a core
   competency for medical doctors, the effect of training has not been
   unequivocally established. Moreover, knowledge about the variance in the
   growth of different skills and whether certain patterns in growth can be
   detected could help us to develop more efficient programmes. We
   therefore investigated the growth in general practitioner (GP) trainees'
   doctor-patient communication skills in their first year and whether the
   growth was different for distinct categories of skills. Methods
   Seventy-one first-year GP trainees were invited to participate in a
   study aimed at measuring their consultation skills at the beginning
   (baseline) and at the end of their first year (follow-up). Consultation
   skills were assessed with the MAAS-Global rating list for consultation
   skills. Results Data on 29 general practitioner trainees were collected.
   MAAS-Global scores showed a significant growth on all items but one.
   Patient-oriented skills showed significantly more growth than
   task-oriented skills. Empathy as a separate skill seems to be mastered
   predominantly before the start of training. Conclusions Three patterns
   in the growth in skills were distinguished: (i) low baseline, relatively
   high follow-up, (ii) moderate baseline, moderate growth and (iii) high
   baseline, hardly any growth. Patient-oriented skills follow either
   pattern (i) or (iii), whereas task-oriented skills follow pattern (ii).
   These findings may help to define where the focus should lie in the
   training of doctor-patient communication skills.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medical schools are currently charged with a lack of
   education as far as empathic/relational skills and the meaning of being
   a health-care provider are concerned, thus leading to increased interest
   in medical humanities.
   Discussion: Medical humanities can offer an insight into human illness
   and in a broader outlook into human condition, understanding of one
   self, responsibility. An empathic relation to patients might be fostered
   by a matching approach to humanities and sciences, which should be
   considered as subjects of equal relevance, complementary to one another.
   Recently, movies have been used in medical - especially psychiatric -
   trainees education, but mainly within the limits of teaching a variety
   of disorders. A different approach dealing with the use of cinema in the
   training of psychiatry residents is proposed, based on Jung and
   Hillman's considerations about the relation between images and
   archetypes, archetypal experience and learning.
   Summary: Selected full-length movies or clips can offer a priceless
   opportunity to face with the meaning of being involved in a
   care-providing, helping profession.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing an empathic physician-patient relationship is an essential
   physician skill. This chapter discusses the sexually dimorphic aspects
   of the neural components involved in affective and cognitive empathy,
   and examines why men and women medical students or physicians express
   different levels of empathy. Studies reveal levels of medical student
   affective or cognitive empathy can help reveal which medical specialty a
   student will enter. The data show students or physicians with higher
   empathy enter into specialties characterized by large amounts of patient
   contact and continuity of care; and individuals with lower levels of
   empathy desire specialties having little or no patient contact and
   little to no continuity of care. Burnout and stress can decrease the
   empathy physicians had when they first entered medical school to
   unacceptable levels. Conversely, having a too empathetic physician can
   let patient conditions and reactions interfere with the ability to
   provide effective care. By learning to blunt affective empathic
   responses, physicians establish a certain degree of empathic detachment
   with the patient in order to provide objective care. However, a
   physician must not become so detached and hardened that their conduct
   appears callous, because it is still important for physicians,

Title = {{Expressing one's feelings and listening to others increases emotional
   intelligence: a pilot study of Asian medical students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: There has been considerable interest in Emotional
   Intelligence (EI) in undergraduate medical education, with respect to
   student selection and admissions, health and well-being and academic
   performance. EI is a significant component of the physician-patient
   relationship. The emotional well-being of the physician is, therefore, a
   significant component in patient care. The aim is to examine the
   measurement of TEIQue-SF in Asian medical students and to explore how
   the practice of listening to the feelings of others and expressing one's
   own feelings influences an individual's EI, set in the context of the
   emotional well-being of a medical practitioner.
   Methods: A group of 183 international undergraduate medical students
   attended a half-day workshop (WS) about mental-health and well-being.
   They completed a self-reported measure of EI on three occasions, pre-
   and post-workshop, and a 1-year follow-up.
   Result: The reliability of TEIQue-SF was high and the reliabilities of
   its four factors were acceptable. There were strong correlations between
   the TEIQue-SF and personality traits. A paired t-test indicated
   significant positive changes after the WS for all students (n=181,
   p=.014), male students (n=78, p=.015) and non-Japanese students (n=112,
   p=.007), but a repeated measures analysis showed that one year
   post-workshop there were significant positive changes for all students
   (n=55, p=.034), female students (n=31, p=.007), especially Japanese
   female students (n=13, p=.023). Moreover, 80\% of the students reported
   that they were more attentive listeners, and 60\% agreed that they were
   more confident in dealing with emotional issues, both within themselves
   and in others, as a result of the workshop.
   Conclusion: This study found the measurement of TEIQue-SF is appropriate
   and reliable to use for Asian medical students. The mental health
   workshop was helpful to develop medical students' EI but showed
   different results for gender and nationality. The immediate impact on
   the emotional awareness of individuals was particularly significant for
   male students and the non-Japanese group. The impact over the long term
   was notable for the significant increase in EI for females and Japanese.
   Japanese female students were more conscious about emotionality.
   Emotion-driven communication exercises might strongly influence the
   development of students' EI over a year.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evidence based largely on self-report data suggests that
   factors associated with medical education erode the critical human
   quality of empathy. These reports have caused serious concern among
   medical educators and clinicians and have led to changes in medical
   curricula around the world. This study aims to provide a more objective
   index of possible changes in empathy across the spectrum of clinical
   exposure, by using a behavioural test of empathic accuracy in addition
   to self-report questionnaires. Moreover, non-medical groups were used to
   control for maturation effects.
   Methods: Three medical groups (N = 3x20) representing a spectrum of
   clinical exposure, and two non-medical groups (N = 2x20) matched for
   age, sex and educational achievements completed self-report measures of
   empathy, and tests of empathic accuracy and interoceptive sensitivity.
   Results: Between-group differences in reported empathy related to
   maturation rather than clinical training/exposure. Conversely, analyses
   of the ``eyes'' test results specifically identified clinical practice,
   but not medical education, as the key influence on performance. The data
   from the interoception task did not support a link between visceral
   feedback and empathic processes.
   Conclusions: Clinical practice, but not medical education, impacts on
   empathy development and seems instrumental in maintaining empathetic
   skills against the general trend of declining empathic accuracy with
   age.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Medical education in Pakistan traditionally emphasizes
   physician's biomedical knowledge with less emphasis on interpersonal
   skills and ability to relate to the patients. This study explored the
   emotional intelligence \& empathy of undergraduate medical students and
   investigated its relationship with various factors to act as baseline
   for future work in this area.
   Methodology: The Schutte Emotional Intelligence scale and Davis'
   Interpersonal Reactivity Index in addition to socio demographic
   questionnaire were administered to first year and final year medical
   undergraduates of two medical Institutions in Lahore, Pakistan. Data was
   analyzed by using SPSS 17 version.
   Results: The overall mean scores for medical students both on emotional
   intelligence and empathy is significantly lower than that found in
   previous literature, highlighting that medical students do not appear to
   fare better than average people in EQ. Women showed statistically
   significant higher scores on Appraisal of emotions, Regulation of
   emotions, Empathic concern Scale \& Personal distress scale. Comparison
   of EI \& IRI of students according to medical college year did not show
   any statistical significance.
   Conclusion: Current medical curriculum and training in Pakistan does not
   appear to increase EI abilities which are building blocks that may allow
   students and residents to develop competence. Medical educators in
   Pakistan should look for ways to incorporate emotional intelligence in
   medical curriculum which will ultimately contribute towards patient
   centered practice, patient satisfaction as well as effective
   communication skills.}},

   (MBI-HSS)]. MBI-HSS scores were analysed in three dimensions: emotional
   exhaustion (EE), depersonalisation (DP), and personal accomplishment
   (PA).
   Of the responding physicians, 42.4 \% scored high for EE burnout, 16.0
   \% for DP, and 15.2 \% for PA. Multiple regression analysis showed that
   low job satisfaction and more patients per day predicted high EE scores.
   Low job satisfaction, working more years at a current workplace, and
   younger age predicted high DP scores. Lack of engagement in education
   and academic work, shorter consultations, and working more years at
   current workplace predicted low PA scores, respectively (P<0.05 for
   each).
   Burnout is common among family physicians in Croatia yet burnout in our
   physicians was not associated with patient enablement, suggesting that
   it did not affect the quality of interpersonal care. Job satisfaction,
   participation in educational or academic activities and sufficient
   consultation time seem to reduce the likelihood of burnout.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing incidence of cancer is at the same time one of the
   leading causes of death all over the world. Many clinical studies show
   that the psychological disorders are more frequent in cancer patients
   than the normal population. That is the reason why ``psychooncology{''}
   is getting popular each day. On the other hand, clinical studies about
   psychological status of the oncologists who are in contact with cancer
   patients ceaselessly and who are mostly responsible to give the ``bad
   news{''} to the cancer patients are very limited. In fact, if the
   clinical studies which show that the frequency of depression and burnout
   syndrome are increasing among physicians are taken into consideration,
   one can say that psycho-oncology must cover all the medical personnel
   who are dealing with cancer patients. It is determined that the rate of
   depression and burnout syndrome is high among oncologists when referred
   to the literature. Several solutions are proposed for the psychological
   conditions of the oncologists and other related personnel who empathize
   with the patients and deliver ``bad news{''} and also try to adopt ideal
   ``patient-physician{''} communication model. The knowledge on the
   psychological conditions of oncology professionals and their behaviour
   and the results of the clinical studies on this subject will be
   discussed and the personal opinion will also be presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Palliative care is a uniquely demanding field in that clinicians
   routinely address the complex needs of patients living with incurable
   illness. Due to their relative inexperience, medical learners completing
   a palliative care educational experience are particularly vulnerable to
   the stresses that are often encountered. To address this educational
   need, a structured Self-Care Module was developed for medical learners
   rotating through a palliative care clinical rotation. Components of this
   module include completion of a process recording exercise, a structured
   reflection, and participation in a facilitated group discussion. An
   examination of the acceptability, utility, and operational feasibility
   of the module demonstrated that 86\% (n = 35) of learners found the
   module helpful in reflecting on their clinical encounters, 86\% (n = 35)
   gained an appreciation for the importance of self-reflection and
   self-awareness as a component of self-care and 97\% (n = 35) gained a
   greater appreciation for sharing clinical experiences with other
   learners. This novel Self-Care Module was found to be a well accepted,
   useful, and operationally feasible educational experience for
   postgraduate and undergraduate learners completing a palliative care
   educational experience.}},

Title = {{Social Media Use in Medical Education: A Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{893-901}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The authors conducted a systematic review of the published literature on
   social media use in medical education to answer two questions: (1) How
   have interventions using social media tools affected outcomes of
   satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, and skills for physicians and
   physicians-in-training? and (2) What challenges and opportunities
   specific to social media have educators encountered in implementing
   these interventions?
   Method
   The authors searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, Embase, PsycINFO,
   ProQuest, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (from
   the start of each through September 12, 2011) using keywords related to
   social media and medical education. Two authors independently reviewed
   the search results to select peer-reviewed, English-language articles
   discussing social media use in educational interventions at any level of
   physician training. They assessed study quality using the Medical
   Education Research Study Quality Instrument.
   Results
   Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria. Interventions using social
   media tools were associated with improved knowledge (e.g., exam scores),
   attitudes (e.g., empathy), and skills (e.g., reflective writing). The
   most commonly reported opportunities related to incorporating social
   media tools were promoting learner engagement (71\% of studies),
   feedback (57\%), and collaboration and professional development (both
   36\%). The most commonly cited challenges were technical issues (43\%),
   variable learner participation (43\%), and privacy/security concerns
   (29\%). Studies were generally of low to moderate quality; there was
   only one randomized controlled trial.
   Conclusions
   Social media use in medical education is an emerging field of
   scholarship that merits further investigation. Educators face challenges
   in adapting new technologies, but they also have opportunities for
   innovation.}},
