Abstract = {{Context Internship is a time of great transition, during which mood
   disturbances are common. However, variations in mood and empathy levels
   throughout the internship year have not been investigated.
   Objective To examine mood patterns and changes in empathy among internal
   medicine residents over the course of the internship year.
   Design Cohort study of interns involving completion of survey
   instruments at 4 points: time I (June 2000; Profile of Mood States
   {[}POMS] and Interpersonal Reactivity Index {[}IRI]), times 2 and 3
   (November 2000 and February 2001; POMS), and time 4 (June 2001; POMS and
   IRI).
   Setting Internal medicine residency program at a University-based
   medical center.
   Participants Sixty-one interns.
   Main Outcome Measures Baseline scores of mood states and empathy; trends
   in mood states and empathy over the internship year.
   Results Response rates for time 1 were 98\%; for time 2, 72\%; for time
   3, 79\%; and for time 4, 79\%. Results of the POMS revealed that
   physicians starting their internship exhibit less tension, depression,
   anger, fatigue, and confusion and have more vigor than general adult and
   college student populations (P < .001 for all). Results of the IRI
   showed better baseline scores for perspective taking (P < .001) and
   empathic concern (P = .007) and lower scores for personal distress (P <
   .001) among interns compared with norms. Five months into internship,
   however, POMS scores revealed significant increases in the
   depression-dejection (P < .001), anger-hostility (P < .001), and
   fatigue-inertia (P < .001) scales, as well as an increase in IRI
   personal distress level (P < .001). These increases corresponded with
   decreases in the POMS vigor-activity scores (P < .001) and I RI empathic
   concern measures (P = .005). Changes persisted throughout the internship
   period.
   Conclusions We found that, in this sample, enthusiasm at the beginning
   of internship soon gave way to depression, anger, and fatigue. Future
   research should be aimed at determining whether these changes persist
   beyond internship.}},

Title = {{Evaluating physicians' professionalism and humanism: The case for

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{489-495}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Physicians' professionalism and humanism have become central foci of the
   efforts of medical educators as the public, various accrediting and
   licensing agencies, and the profession itself have expressed concerns
   about the apparent erosion of physicians' competency in these aspects of
   the art, rather than the science, of medicine. Of the many obstacles to
   enhancing trainees' skills in these domains, one of the most significant
   is the difficulty in assessing competency in physicians' professionalism
   and humanism. The author suggests that the assessment of these aspects
   of the art of medicine has more in common with the approaches used in
   criticism of the arts than with the quantitative assessment tools
   appropriate to the scientific method and the medical model. Quantitative
   and semi-quantitative tools, so effective in elucidating the etiology,
   pathophysiology, and treatment of disease, are often inappropriate and
   invalid when applied to evaluation of professional and humanistic
   competencies. The author proposes that humanism ``connoisseurs{''} be
   employed to qualitatively evaluate medical trainees' professionalism and
   humanism. Such connoisseurs Would possess expert knowledge, training,
   and experience in the interpersonal aspects of the art of medicine,
   allowing them to deconstruct concepts such as empathy, compassion,
   integrity, and respect into their respective key elements while
   evaluating physicians' behaviors as an integrated, Cohesive whole.
   Through the use of a rich descriptive vocabulary, humanism connoisseurs
   would provide valid formative and summative feedback regarding
   competency in medical professionalism and humanism. In the process, they
   would serve to Counteract the relative marginalization of
   professionalism and humanism in the informal and lived curricula of
   medical trainees.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The study examined the pattern of utilization of Maternal
   and Child Health (MCH)-services of women with child-bearing experience
   in a suburb of city Kabul.
   Methods. A semi-structured questionnaire administered to 100 women in
   the community and 40 in the maternal hospital. Interviews and
   observations in the local MCH-clinic were used to collect the relevant
   information.
   Results. Sixty one of the 100 women in the community delivered at home
   exclusively, 35 having experienced both home and institutional
   deliveries, four women had hospital childbirths only. Approximately half
   of the women decided about utilizing the modern MCH services themselves.
   Women valued in the MCH-clinic mainly medical care and vaccinations.
   Delivery was seen primarily as a technical event, but when probed more
   deeply it was obvious, that fear of death was the driving power for
   decisions made. With at-home deliveries female relatives were preferred
   as birth assistants. If outside assistance was required, trained
   midwives were preferred rather than traditional birth attendants.
   Institutional delivery was seen as the last resource for complicated
   deliveries, but was also esteemed by many because of the security and
   cleaness. Professional skill, but also empathy and justice were
   appreciated in professionals.
   Conclusions. Promoting rooming-in and early breast feeding in the
   maternity wards, ongoing education of the MCH-staff about communication
   skills, ethics and teaching methods, dialogue with decision makers on
   all levels in the society about MCH including family planning, ongoing
   training and support of community midwives (dayas) in the community by
   local MCH-staff, adequate supplies, inexpensive services, incentive
   money for the competent staff members are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Background: When empathy was presented in a lecture, medical students
   did not appreciate the topic or have opportunities to practice empathic
   techniques. The Patient Navigator Project was designed to foster
   understanding of a patient's experiences and encourage empathic
   communication.
   Methods: The project uses experiential learning in an outpatient setting
   in the first year of training. Each student was to ``shadow{''} a
   patient during a visit to a surgical oncologist and could observe the
   patient throughout treatment. Patient consent was obtained. Assignments
   were made before the appointments. Afterward, students met in small
   groups to reflect on their experiences.
   Results: Patients were willing to let medical students observe their
   care. Most students reported a positive learning experience and that
   they learned to see patients as people. not as numbers or diseases.
   Conclusions: Requiring individualized patient-centered activities in the
   preclinical curriculum is challenging owing to the large number of
   students and the unpredictable nature of patients. (C) 2002 Excerpta

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Context Empathy is a major component of a satisfactory doctor-patient
   relationship and the cultivation of empathy is a learning objective
   proposed by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) for all
   American medical schools. Therefore, it is important to address the
   measurement of empathy, its development and its correlates in medical
   schools.
   Objectives We designed this study to test two hypotheses: firstly, that
   medical students with higher empathy scores would obtain higher ratings
   of clinical competence in core clinical clerkships; and secondly, that
   women would obtain higher empathy scores than men.
   Materials and subjects A 20-item empathy scale developed by the authors
   (Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy ) was completed by 371 third-year
   medical students (198 men, 173 women).
   Methods Associations between empathy scores and ratings of clinical
   competence in six core clerkships, gender, and performance on objective
   examinations were studied by using t -test, analysis of variance,
   chi-square and correlation coefficients.
   Results Both research hypotheses were confirmed. Empathy scores were
   associated with ratings of clinical competence and gender, but not with
   performance in objective examinations such as the Medical College
   Admission Test (MCAT), and Steps 1 and 2 of the US Medical Licensing
   Examinations (USMLE).
   Conclusions Empathy scores are associated with ratings of clinical
   competence and gender. The operational measure of empathy used in this
   study provides opportunities to further examine educational and clinical
   correlates of empathy, as well as stability and changes in empathy at
   different stages of undergraduate and graduate medical education.}},

Abstract = {{The decoding of the human genome offers great promise for the

   now accepted by many leading figures of the medical establishment that
   the undergraduate curriculum must evolve to incorporate a variety of
   subjects conventionally taught in the faculty of humanities at our great
   universities. In this article, the case is argued that the study of
   `medical humanities' will enhance the empathy, communication skills,
   ethical standing and, paradoxically, the scientific literacy of the next
   generation of young doctors. As a clinical scientist, I cannot prove
   these assertions with an evidence base, but offer up arguments as
   qualitative or hypothesis generation.}},

Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{752-757}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Health maintenance organizations and other payers
   increasingly use patient satisfaction data to profile physician
   performance. Little is known about physicians' use of patient
   satisfaction information or how profiles affect individual physician
   behaviors. The objective of this study was to examine primary care
   physicians' perceptions of performance profiles based on patient
   satisfaction data, whether physicians use profiles to change practice
   behaviors, and which profile components physicians think are important
   for assessing quality of care.
   Methods. A written survey was conducted in 1998 in Massachusetts with
   810 primary care physicians (304 pediatricians, 201 family
   practitioners, 305 internists) who had at least 100 patients in a large
   managed care plan and had received 1 or more profiles based on patient
   satisfaction data. Physicians in training were excluded. Physicians'
   perceptions of profiles and their reported use to change practice
   behaviors were measured.
   Results. The response rate was 68\%. Twenty-three percent reported that
   profiles were very or extremely useful for improving care. Only 7\%
   reported using profiles often or always to change care. Although
   specific profile components related to interpersonal aspects of care
   were rated more useful, <11\% reported using profiles often or always to
   make changes on any individual component. A majority, 67\% to 89\%,
   reported making no or minor changes on profile components. Responses did
   not vary by specialty, demographics, or practice characteristics.
   Physicians rated interpersonal factors (eg, ability to communicate with
   patients, ability to show caring and empathy) as the most important
   indicators of quality of care; they report having the most control over
   these factors. Office factors (eg, staying on schedule, ease of
   scheduling appointments) were ranked as least important for assessing
   quality of care.
   Conclusion. Although health maintenance organizations and other payers
   increasingly use patient satisfaction reports to profile individual
   physicians and guide physician compensation and health plan
   participation, <25\% of primary care physicians find profiles useful for
   improving patient care and even fewer report using profiles to change
   practice. Profiles likely have limited influence on behavior changes.
   Payers who invest in profiles may find it advantageous to focus on
   health plans and practice facilities rather than on individual
   physicians.}},

Abstract = {{To explore how primary care clinician-teachers actually attempt to
   convey empathy to medical students and residents, the author carried out
   a qualitative study in 19992000 in which 12 primary care physicians
   reflected on their views of empathy, how they demonstrated empathy to
   patients, and how they went about teaching empathy to learners.
   Interview data were triangulated with observations of actual teaching
   sessions and informal questioning of students and residents who had been
   taught by the faculty participants. Grounded theory was used to
   interpret the data.
   The faculty had clear conceptualizations of what empathy meant in
   clinical practice, but differed as to whether it was primarily a
   measurable, behavioral skill or a global attitude. Respondents stressed
   the centrality of role modeling in teaching, and most used debriefing
   strategies, as well as both learner- and patient-centered approaches, in
   instructing learners about empathy. Findings suggest that limiting the
   teaching of empathy to a skill-based approach does not reflect the
   richness of what actually occurs in the clinical setting, and that it is
   important to teach empathy comprehensively, acknowledging both
   behavioral and attitudinal tools.}},

Title = {{Can communication skills training alter physicians' beliefs and behavior

Abstract = {{Purpose : To measure the psychosocial attitudes and beliefs of
   physicians working within oncology in the United Kingdom and to examine
   whether beliefs alter after communication skills training. Additionally,
   to investigate whether physicians' attitudes are reflected in
   communication behaviors with patients during interviews.
   Methods: Ninety-three physicians completed a 32-item Physician
   Psychosocial Belief (PPSB) questionnaire at baseline (T1) before
   randomization to attendance at a 3-day residential communication skills
   course (n = 48) or a control group (n = 45). Three months later (T2),
   both groups completed another PPSB and a self-assessment questionnaire
   recording perceived changes in communication with patients. At both time
   points, physicians' consultations with two consenting patients were
   videotaped. Communication behaviors were measured using the Medical
   Interaction Processing System.
   Results : Physicians who attended the course showed significantly
   improved attitudes and beliefs toward psychosocial issues compared with
   controls (P = .002). This improvement was reflected in the analysis of
   the videotaped recordings of their communication behaviors with
   patients. Expressions of empathy were more likely for the course group
   at T2 than the controls (P = .02), as were open questions (P = .001),
   appropriate responses to patient cues (P = .005), and psychosocial
   probing (P = .041). These objective findings were supported by
   physicians' self report of changes in communication style during
   interviews with patients.
   Conclusion: Our results show that a communication skills training
   intervention using behavioral, cognitive, and affective components not
   only increases potentially beneficial and more effective interviewing
   styles but can also alter attitudes and beliefs, thus increasing the
   likelihood that such skills will be used in the clinical setting. (C)

Abstract = {{The effective practice of medicine requires narrative competence, that

   of literature and reflective writing allows narrative medicine to
   examine and illuminate 4 of medicine's central narrative situations:
   physician and patient, physician and self, physician and colleagues, and
   physicians and society. With narrative competence, physicians can reach
   and join their patients in illness, recognize their own personal
   journeys through medicine, acknowledge kinship with and duties toward
   other health care professionals, and inaugurate consequential discourse
   with the public about health care. By bridging the divides that separate
   physicians from patients, themselves, colleagues, and society, narrative
   medicine offers fresh opportunities for respectful, empathic, and

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of this study is to understand in depth the
   experience of the family physician faced with the patient that he
   perceives as `difficult'. This was done by means of the `long interview'
   as a method of qualitative research.
   Method. We interviewed 15 randomly selected Board-certified family
   physicians, with five or more years experience as specialists, employed
   in the northern district of the `Clalit Health Services', the major sick
   fund in Israel.
   Results. The participants stated that the `difficult' patients are not
   those with difficult medical problems but rather those who are violent,
   demanding, aggressive, rude and who seek secondary gain. Patients with
   multiple non-specific complaints and those with psychosomatic problems
   are also difficult for the family physician. Appropriate use of
   patient-doctor communication skills and an effort to improve relations
   with the patient through empathy, tolerance and non-judgmental listening
   were suggested by the physicians as ways of making the difficult
   encounter easier.
   Conclusions. Family physicians acknowledge their responsibility for the
   `difficult' patient, and seek innovative and creative ways to cope with
   the difficult medical encounter. The more experienced the doctor is, the
   less he perceives patients as `difficult', as he learns to accept
   greater diversity of behaviours in his patients.}},

Abstract = {{Low compliance to prescribed medical interventions is an ever present
   and complex problem, especially for patients with a chronic illness.
   With increasing numbers of medications shown to do more good than harm
   when taken as prescibed, low compliance is a major problem in health
   care. Relevant studies were retrieved through comprehensive searches of
   different database systems to enable a thorough assessment of the major
   issues in compliance to prescribed medical interventions. The term
   compliance is the main term used in this review because the majority of
   papers reviewed used this term.
   Three decades have passed since the first workshop on compliance
   research. It is timely to pause and to reflect on the accumulated
   knowledge. The enormous amount of quantitative research undertaken is of
   variable methodological quality, with no gold standard for the
   measurement of compliance and it is often not clear which type of
   non-compliance is being studied. Many authors do not even feel the need
   to define adherence. Often absent in the research on compliance is the
   patient, although the concordance model points at the importance of the
   patient's agreement and harmony in the doctor-patient relationship.
   The backbone of the concordance model is the patient as a decision maker
   and a cornerstone is professional empathy. Recently, some qualitative
   research has identified important issues such as the quality of the
   doctor-patient relationship and patient health beliefs in this context.
   Because non-compliance remains a major health problem, more high quality
   studies are needed to assess these aspects and systematic
   reviews/meta-analyses are required to study the effects of compliance in
   enhancing the effects of interventions.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify the preferences and concerns of seriously III
   patients about discussing religious and spiritual beliefs with
   physicians.
   DESIGN. Three focus group discussions with patients who had experienced
   a recent life-threatening illness. Discussions were audiotaped,
   transcribed verbatim, and reviewed independently by two investigators to
   identify discrete comments for grouping into domains. A third
   investigator adjudicated differences in opinion. Comments were then
   independently reviewed for relevance and consistency by a health
   services researcher and a pastoral counselor. SETTING: Academic medical
   center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Referred sample of 22 patients hospitalized with a recent
   life-threatening illness.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Almost all of the 562 comments could be
   grouped into one of five broad domains: 1) religiosity/spirituality, 2)
   prayer, 3) patient-physician relationship, 4) religious/spiritual
   conversations, and 5) recommendations to physicians. God, prayer, and
   spiritual beliefs were often mentioned as sources of comfort, support,
   and healing. All participants stressed the importance of physician
   empathy. Willingness to participate in spiritual discussions with
   doctors was closely tied to the patient-physician relationship. Although
   divided on the proper context, patients agreed that physicians must have
   strong interpersonal skills for discussions to be fruitful.
   Physician-initiated conversation without a strong patient-physician
   relationship was viewed as inappropriate and as implying a poor
   prognosis.
   CONCLUSION: Religion and spirituality are a source of comfort for many
   patients. Although not necessarily expecting physicians to discuss
   spirituality, patients want physicians to ask about coping and support
   mechanisms. This exploratory study suggests that if patients then
   disclose the importance of spiritual: beliefs In their lives, they would
   like physicians to respect these values.}},

   limits of medicine, death and dying, anticipating future challenges, and
   identification with the patient. Students evaluated this creative

Abstract = {{The expression of emotion and the sharing of information are determined
   by cultural factors, consultation time, and the structure of the health
   care system. Two emblematic situations in Spain - the expression of
   aggression in the patient-physician encounter, and the withholding of
   diagnostic information from the patient - have not been well-described
   in their sociocultural context. To explore these, the authors observed
   and participated in clinical practice and teaching in several settings
   throughout Spain and analyzed field notes using qualitative methods. In
   this paper, we explore three central constructs - modesty (pudor),
   dignity (honor), and authority (autoridad) - and their expressions in
   patient-physician encounters. We define two types of emotions in
   clinical settings - public, extroverted expressions of anger and
   exuberance, and private, deeply held feelings of fear and grief that
   tend to be expressed through the arts and religion. Premature
   reassurance and withholding of information are interpreted as attempts
   to reconstruct the honor and pudor of the patient. Physician authority
   and perceived loyalty to the government-run health care system generate
   conflict and aggression in the patient-physician relationship. These
   clinical behaviors are contextualized within cultural definitions of
   effective communication, an ideal patient-physician relationship, the
   role of the family, and ethical behavior. Despite agreement on the goals
   of medicine, the behavioral manifestations of empathy and caring in
   Spain contrast substantially with northern European and North American
   cultures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of antimicrobial agents, there has been an
   association between antibiotic use and the development of antimicrobial
   resistance. Antibiotic therapy eradicates not only pathogenic organisms
   but also the protective normal flora. This so-called ``selective
   pressure{''} results in colonization with bacteria that are resistant to
   the original therapy. The result has been an increase over the past two
   decades in antibiotic resistance among common bacteria{[} causes of
   outpatient infections. Several studies have demonstrated that a
   substantial portion of the antibiotics prescribed in the outpatient
   setting are given for viral illnesses or bacterial diseases where the
   benefit of antibacterial therapy is marginal. The reasons for
   prescribing antibiotics in these situations are related to medical and
   social factors. Physicians should be familiar with the clinical
   situations in which they should provide antibiotics and those in which
   they may safely be withheld. Physicians should understand the
   motivations of patients who are seeking antibiotics and provide
   education, empathy and alternative treatments.}},

   numerical ratings, medical educators also use the rich qualitative
   material produced in the SP examination (e.g., patient comments,

   clinical competence, which involves the purposive integration of basic

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. To determine senior residents' views on the meaning of
   professionalism and how they learned about it.
   Method. By means of a modified Dillman technique, all senior residents
   at two faculties of medicine (n = 533) were surveyed about
   professionalism during the 1998-99 academic year. The residents were
   asked to list attributes of professionalism and to rank methods they
   found most useful for learning about professionalism, to rate the
   adequacy and quality of their teaching about professionalism and their
   comfort in explaining the concert of professionalism to a more junior
   trainee, to list suggestions about how teaching about professionalism
   could be improved, and to name the medical organization most concerned
   with matters of professionalism
   Results. A total of 258 residents (48.4\%) responded. They listed 1,052
   attributes they associated with professionalism. The three most common
   attributes, all listed by more than 100 respondents, were respect,
   competence, and empathy. The respondents had learned the most about
   professionalism from observing role models, they rated the quantity and
   quality of teaching about it positively, and they felt comfortable
   explaining professionalism to a junior resident. Only 56\% of the
   residents correctly identified the Canadian medical organization most
   concerned with professionalism.
   Conclusion. Residents' knowledge about professionalism reflects their
   early stage of development as physicians and their daily activities,
   where such aspects of proiessionalism as the social contract, codes of
   ethics, participation in professional societies, and altruism are not
   highlighted. Residency programs should develop teaching activities
   focusing on professionalism that: relate to issues residents face in
   their daily work.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{North American physicians emerge from their medical training with a wide
   array of professional beliefs and values. Many are thoughtful and
   introspective. Many are devoted to patients' welfare. Some bring to
   their work a broad view of social responsibility. Nonetheless, the
   authors contend that North American medical education favors an explicit
   commitment to traditional values of doctoring-empathy, compassion, and
   altruism among them -and a tacit commitment to behaviors grounded in an
   ethic of detachment, self-interest, and objectivity.
   They further note that medical students and young physicians respond to
   this conflict in various ways. Some re-conceptualize themselves
   primarily as technicians and narrow their professional identities to an
   ethic of competence, thus adopting the tacit values and discarding the
   explicit professionalism. Others develop non-reflective professionalism,
   an implicit avowal that they best care for their patients by treating
   them as objects of technical services (medical care).
   Another group appears to be ``immunized{''} against the tacit values,
   and thus they internalize and develop professional virtue. Certain
   personal characteristics of the student, such as gender, belief system,
   and non-medical commitments, probably play rules in ``immunization,{''}
   as do medical school features such as family medicine, communication
   skills courses, medical ethics, humanities, and social issues in
   medicine. To be effective, though, these features must be prominent and
   tightly integrated into the medical school curriculum.
   The locus of change in the culture of medicine has now shifted to
   ambulatory settings and the marketplace. It remains to be seen whether
   this move will lessen the disjunction between the explicit curriculum
   and the manifestly contradictory values of detachment and entitlement,
   and the belief that the patient's interest always coincides with the
   physician's interest.}},

Abstract = {{The growing abundance of highly immunogenic vaccines has arrived with a
   burden of pain, distress, and common adverse reactions that in turn may
   interfere with parental compliance and aggravate anti-vaccine sentiment.
   In a study of 150 children in each of 2 age-groups, we found that
   approximately 20\% of the subjects suffered serious distress or worse.
   During the procedural phase, approximately 90\% of the 15-to-18 month
   old children and 45\% of the 4-to-6 year old children showed serious
   distress or worse. To address non-adherence with pediatric vaccine
   schedules, we must consider all of the possible issues that might
   prevent a parent from taking a child to a health care provider for
   vaccination. In that same study we identified useful predictors for both
   preparatory and procedural distress - predictors that might be used in
   identifying children who might benefit from preventive interventions.
   Vaccine providers might consider a variety of interventions. Attitude,
   empathy, instruction. and practice have all been shown to have a
   salutatory effect upon pain and anxiety with medical procedures in
   general and specifically with vaccinations. Distraction has also been
   found to be an effective method for distress and pain prevention in
   children. More formal methods of clinical hypnosis which combine a deep
   state of relaxation with focused imagery and suggestion have also been
   found to be effective in helping children and adolescents prepare for,
   cope with, and tolerate the pain and anxiety associated with medical
   procedures. So-called `sugar nipples' delivering small amounts of
   sucrose orally at the time of a painful procedure in an infant has been
   not been shown to decrease vaccination pain and studies on refrigerant
   topical anesthetics are mixed. Studies have found a eutectic mixture of
   2.5\% lidocaine and 2.5\% prilocaine (EMLA) effective in providing
   adequate local anesthesia in children, but it suffers from problems in
   practical application. Studies with various injection techniques have
   not identified ready solutions, and although jet injection appears to
   provoke less anxiety and cause less immediate pain, studies also
   indicate a somewhat greater incidence of delayed local reactogenicity
   including soreness and edema. Other measures to prevent or rapidly treat
   other common adverse events have been shown effective and should be
   considered as well. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   define it, teach it, examine it. It is difficult to evaluate many of the
   attributes that we desire in a doctor; and examples of this include
   empathy, ethical behaviour, problem-solving skills, ability to
   self-educate and teamwork. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that it
   is better to measure uncertainly the significant than to measure
   reliably and validly the trivial. Furthermore different methods of
   assessment suit different educational objectives (fitness for purpose)
   and this supports the use of multiple assessment techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Patient satisfaction is an important part and a measure of
   the quality of health care. Patient satisfaction with family physicians
   was studied within the project `Analysis of Transition of Health Care

   Objectives. The aim of this study was to explore patient satisfaction
   with family physicians through evaluation of some characteristics of
   physician behaviour. The specific goals of this study were to determine
   whether there were differences in the evaluation of patient satisfaction
   with physician behaviour with regard to some sociodemographic
   characteristics of the respondents.
   Methods. The study group consisted of 1217 respondents: 479 (39.4\%) men
   and 738 (60.6\%) women. Medical students interviewed the respondents
   `face-to-face' immediately after their consultation with the physician.
   An anonymous questionnaire was created providing answers to 10 questions
   on patient satisfaction. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and
   the reason for encounter of the respondents were also collected.
   Results. The average positive rating over 10 questions on patient
   satisfaction was 85.3\%. There was a statistically significant
   difference in age distribution between geographic areas (P < 0.001).
   Differences in answers were found regarding sex, age, educational level
   (P < 0.001) and reason for encounter (P < 0.01). Two factors were
   obtained by factor analysis: the fi rst could be called physician's
   competence/expertise estimated by respondents, and the other physician's
   empathy evaluated by respondents. The respondents were divided into two
   groups based on the reason for encounter as a criterion for discriminant
   analysis: acute (symptoms and complaints, injuries; n = 553) and other
   reasons (n = 664). The discriminant function obtained was statistically
   significant (P < 0.01). Younger respondents, regardless of sex, whose
   reason for encounter was an acute condition, were less satisfied with
   the physician's expertise, agreeableness during the consultation,
   physician's interest in what they were saying and physician's
   friendliness.
   Conclusion. Considering the difficulties present in the health systems
   of countries in transition, the results of our study were surprisingly
   encouraging, showing that the respondents were satisfied with the
   physician's behaviour and that the physicians fulfilled the basic
   elements of professional behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the prematurity stereotype was extended by randomly
   assigning 158 Israeli medical and nursing students to view full-term
   infants labelled either `full-term' (FTL) or `premature' (PL). One-half
   of the students were additionally assigned to a goal condition in which
   they were informed that their judgements would be evaluated for their
   accuracy. Overall, students were found to show strong stereotyping
   effects, rating PL infants more negatively than FTL infants when asked
   questions about their expectations for the infants' growth and
   development as well as their expectations for how mothers of these
   infants might behave during a medically related contact concerning her
   infant. However, the content of the stereotype varied across type of
   health care provider when general perceptions of the infants' status
   characteristics were elicited, with pre-clinical medical students
   showing greater levels of stereotyping than upper level students. Only
   limited effects involving the goal condition were found. When
   communicating with mothers, upper level students reported that they
   would respond more time-expediently and pre-clinical students reported
   that they would show more empathy. The findings emphasize the important
   role stereotypes play in interpersonal processes, including
   caregiver-patient interactions. Implications for medical education and
   practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Successful management of chronic pain in older people is dependent on a

   However, detailed attention must also be paid to the effects of

   with patients who often have sight and hearing impediments, and on the
   feasible range of functional outcomes for each patient. Drug
   interactions are common in older people as they take more medications
   and have reduced ability to clear most analgesic and adjuvant
   medications. This suggests a larger than usual role for
   non-pharmacological management strategies. However, simple analgesics
   and narcotics are safe to use in older people without overt liver and
   renal disease, providing the lowest dose compatible with functional
   improvement is sought; the goal of therapy is to maintain optimum
   function rather than cure the pain. In general the outcome is positive
   for both the patient and the practitioner as patients usually respond to
   medical, physical, psychosocial and cognitive behavioural programmes as
   well as young adults if given an appropriate milieu, adequate time and

   activity, synchronism, video-assistance, self-controlling,
   individualization, analysis. The Furka microsurgical educational method,
   named after one of the authors, is 20 hours long (five 4-hour sessions).
   The first lesson allows students to become acquainted with the
   microsurgical instruments. The next lesson consists of learning the
   probe of layer-feeling. The third lesson is to learn how to produce
   stitches under the microscope. The fourth lesson includes arterial
   anastomosis preparation on fresh arterial pieces of animal origin. The
   fifth lesson means a quality change from previous classes, as practice
   is performed on living animals, generally rats. The teaching of
   microsurgical basics requires both patience and empathy. The teaching

Abstract = {{Aim-To investigate whether attitudes to parenting were altered in final
   year medical students following a period spent caring for a simulated
   infant.
   Methods-Seventy medical students during their paediatric attachment in
   the final year completed a questionnaire regarding personal childcare
   attitudes. Students attached to a teaching hospital were allocated a 24
   hour time period to care for ((Baby Think It Over{''} (BTIO), a
   computerised doll that simulates a 6 week old infant and records care
   given. The students then completed a second questionnaire assessing the
   impact of the experience.
   Results-Forty nine per cent of students thought their advice regarding
   sick children was less valid than if they had their own children; 96\%
   of students believed their approach to parents caring for young infants
   could be improved by caring for a 6 week old infant. All the students
   felt their lifestyle would be affected. Following the BTIO care period,
   79\% considered the experience straightforward, with 35\% expressing a
   little more empathy and 15\% a lot more empathy for parents as a result.
   Thoughts regarding impact on lifestyle were unaltered. Caring for BTIO,
   however, was not considered to be a realistic experience and overall not
   particularly useful.
   Conclusion-Simulated infants are of only limited value in increasing
   medical student understanding of parental concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction General practice trainers hold a key position in general
   practice training, especially through their provision of a role model.
   Their own competence in general practice care is important in this
   regard. The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether a quality
   assessment programme could identify the strengths and weaknesses of GP
   trainers in four main domains of general practice care.
   Methods The quality assessment programme comprised validated tests on
   four domains of general practice: general medical knowledge, knowledge
   of medical-technical skills, consultation skills and practice
   management. The criterion for the identification of relative strengths,
   and weaknesses of GP trainers was a variation in the scores of trainers
   indicating higher and lower scores (strengths and weaknesses) within
   each domain.
   Results GP trainers (n = 105) were invited to participate in the study
   and 90\% (n = 94) did so. The variation in scores allowed the indication
   of strengths and weaknesses. Main strengths were: general medical
   knowledge of the digestive system; knowledge of medical skills relating
   to the skin; consultation skills concerning empathy; practice management
   with regard to accessibility. Main weaknesses were: general medical
   knowledge of the neurological system; knowledge of the medical/technical
   skills relating to the endocrine metabolic and nutritional system;
   consultation skills regarding shared decision making; practice
   management involving cooperation with staff and other care providers.
   Discussion This first systematic evaluation of GP trainers identified
   their strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses identified will be used
   in the improvement process as topics for collective improvement in the
   GP trainers' general curriculum and in individual learning plans.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine: 1) the relationship between residents' responses
   toward caring for underserved children and families during residency and
   their perceptions of their continuity clinic experience; and 2) which
   characteristics are related to continuing to care for the underserved
   after completion of training.
   Design. Cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Methods. A 49-item questionnaire was mailed to 210 third-year pediatric
   residents at 12 urban training programs in the Northeast in May 1995.
   Information was collected about residents' emotional responses toward
   caring for underserved families, their assessments of clinic operations,
   their sense of effectiveness in caring for underserved patients in
   continuity clinic, preresidency experiences with the underserved, and
   their intent to care for the underserved after training.
   Results. Of 210 surveys mailed, 71\% were returned. Thirty-six percent
   of residents planned to pursue a career in primary care, 53\% did not,
   and 11\% did not answer or were planning a year as chief resident.
   Fifty-seven percent of all residents planned to devote a portion of
   their practice toward caring for the underserved after training.
   Residents whose emotional responses toward caring for the underserved
   included: 1) not worrying that they had become numb to children's
   psychosocial difficulties, 2) not feeling angry with how families cared
   for their children, and 3) feeling more empathy with the underserved had
   significantly higher mean scores on both their assessment of clinic
   operations and their sense of effectiveness. The only demographic
   characteristic associated with a greater sense of effectiveness was
   being black.
   To better characterize which residents planned to care for the
   underserved after training, we examined a subsample of 46 residents who
   recalled an interest in caring for the underserved during residency
   training and who were pursuing a career in primary care. Residents that
   did not recall an interest in caring for the underserved at the onset of
   residency training were unlikely to have plans to care for the
   underserved after the completion of training. Within this group
   residents who planned to care for the underserved after training
   differed significantly from residents who did not plan to continue this
   work by feeling a greater sense of effectiveness in clinic, feeling less
   worried about becoming numb, and having greater empathy for underserved
   families.
   Conclusions. There are a number of identifiable emotional responses
   residents develop toward caring for the underserved that relate to their
   perceptions of continuity clinic and whether a resident chooses to
   continue to care for the underserved after training.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Reflexivity as a strategy in general practice can be used to implement a
   patient-centred approach in the consultation. General practice has long
   represented a tradition attempting to integrate both illness and
   disease. For the GP, it is natural to focus on the patient's whole
   situation, and the GP's experience with patients is often based on a
   long-term relationship. Reflexivity implies having a self-conscious
   account of the production of knowledge as it is being produced. We
   believe that GPs can gain access to additional knowledge by consciously
   using reflexivity as a strategy in the consultation. In the present
   article, we discuss reflexivity in relation to the notions of empathy,
   personal experience and self-knowledge. By using reflexivity in order to
   rely on personal experience, the GP can gain access to patients'
   understanding of their health. Reflexivity can be a valuable concept for
   the GP in patient-centred medicine and can contribute to bridging the
   gap between the patient's perspective and the doctor's understanding of
   the patient's health.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To explore the contribution patients can make to medical education
   from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, to describe a
   framework for reviewing and monitoring patient involvement in specific
   educational situations and to generate suggestions for further research.
   Methods Literature review.
   Results Direct contact with patients can be seen to play a crucial role
   in the development of clinical reasoning, communication skills,
   professional attitudes and empathy. It also motivates through promoting
   relevance and providing context. Few studies have explored this area,
   including effects on the patients themselves, although there are
   examples of good practice in promoting more active participation.
   Conclusion The Cambridge framework is a tool for evaluating the
   involvement of patients in the educational process, which could be used
   by curriculum planners and teachers to review and monitor the extent to
   which patients are actively involved. Areas for further research include
   looking at the `added value' of using real, as opposed to simulated,
   patients; more work on outcomes for patients (other than satisfaction);
   the role of real patients in assessment; and the strengths and

Abstract = {{Context Patients often present clues (direct or indirect comments about
   personal aspects of their lives or their emotions) during conversations
   with their physicians. These clues represent opportunities for
   physicians to demonstrate understanding and empathy and thus, to deepen
   the therapeutic alliance that is at the heart of clinical care. A
   paucity of information exists regarding how physicians address the
   psychological and social concerns of patients.
   Objectives To assess how patients present clues and how physicians
   respond to these clues in routine primary care and surgical settings.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Descriptive, qualitative study of 116
   randomly selected routine office visits to 54 primary care physicians
   and 62 surgeons in community-based practices in Oregon and Colorado,
   audiotaped and transcribed in 1994.
   Main Outcome Measures Frequency of presentation of clues by patients
   during office visits, nature (emotional vs social) and content of clues,
   and nature of physician responses to clues, coded as positive or missed
   opportunity.
   Results Fifty-two percent and 53\% of the visits in primary care and
   surgery, respectively, included 1 or more clues. During visits with
   clues, the mean number of clues per visit was 2.6 in primary care and
   1.9 in surgery. Patients initiated approximately 70\% of clues, and
   physicians initiated 30\%. Seventy-six percent of patient-initiated
   clues in primary care settings and 60\% in surgical settings were
   emotional in nature. In surgery, 70\% of emotional clues related to
   patients' feelings about their biomedical condition, while in primary
   care, emotional clues more often related to psychological or social
   concerns (80\%) in patients' lives. Physicians responded positively to
   patient emotions in 38\% of cases in surgery and 21\% in primary care,
   but more frequently they missed opportunities to adequately acknowledge
   patients' feelings. Visits with missed opportunities tended to be longer
   than visits with a positive response.
   Conclusion This study suggests that physicians in both primary care and
   surgery can improve their ability to respond to patient clues even in
   the context of their busy clinical practices.}},

Title = {{Stress management in medical education: A review of the literature}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{748-759}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. To review systematically clinical studies providing empirical
   data on stress-management programs in medical training.
   Method. The authors searched Medline and PSYCHINFO from 1966 to 1999.
   Studies were included if they evaluated stress-management programs for
   medical trainees (medical students, interns, or residents); reported
   empirical data; and had been conducted at allopathic medical schools.
   Results. Although the search yielded over 600 articles discussing the
   importance of addressing the stress of medical education, only 24
   studies reported intervention programs, and only six of those used
   rigorous scientific method.
   Results revealed that: medical trainees participating in
   stress-management programs demonstrated (1) improved immunologic
   functioning, (2) decreases in depression and anxiety, (3) increased
   spirituality and empathy, (4) enhanced knowledge of alternative
   therapies for future referrals, (5) improved knowledge of the effects of
   stress, (6) greater use of positive coping skills, and (7) the ability
   to resolve role conflicts. Despite these promising results, the studies
   had many limitations.
   Conclusion. The following considerations should be incorporated into
   future research: (1) rigorous study design, including randomization and
   control (comparison) groups, (2) measurement of moderator variables to
   determine which intervention works best for wham, (3) specificity of
   outcome measures, and (4) follow up assessment, including effectiveness
   of future patient care.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which perceptions of specific aspects
   of the doctor-patient relationship are related to overall satisfaction
   with primary care physicians among HIV-infected patients.
   DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational study of HIV-infected persons new to
   primary HIV care. Data were collected at enrollment and approximately 6
   months later by in-person interview.
   SETTING: Two urban medical centers in the northeastern United States.
   PARTICIPANTS: Patients seeking primary HIV care for the first time.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was
   patient-reported satisfaction with a primary care physician measured 6
   months after initiating primary HIV care. Patients who were more
   comfortable discussing personal issues with their physicians (P = .021),
   who perceived their primary care physicians as more empathetic (P =
   .001), and who perceived their primary care physicians as more
   knowledgeable with respect to HIV (P = .002) were significantly more
   satisfied with their primary care physicians, adjusted for
   characteristics of the patient and characteristics of primary care.
   Collectively, specific aspects of the doctor-patient relationship
   explained 56\% of the variation in overall satisfaction with the primary
   care physician.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients' perceptions of their primary care physician's HIV
   knowledge and empathy were highly related to their satisfaction with
   this physician. Satisfaction among HIV-infected patients was not
   associated with patients' sociodemographic characteristics, HIV risk
   characteristics, alcohol and drug use, health status, quality of life,
   or concordant patient-physician gender and racial matching.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Philosophers who studied moral development have found that individuals
   normally progress rapidly in early adulthood from a conventional stage
   in which they base behavior on the norms and values of those around them
   to a more principled stage where they identify and attempt to live by
   personal moral values. Available data suggest that many medical
   students, who should be in this transition, show little change in their
   moral development. Possibly, this relates to perceived pressures to
   conform to the informal culture of the medical wards. Many students
   experience considerable internal dissidence as they struggle to
   accommodate personal values related to empathy, care, and compassion to
   their clinical training. Educational interventions that positively
   influence this process have established regular opportunities for
   critical reflection by the students in small groups. Other interventions
   include faculty development to enhance role modeling and feedback by
   clinical faculty. The author espouses more widespread adoption of these
   educational interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Context Improved teamwork and greater collaboration between professions
   are important factors in effective health care. These goals may be
   achieved by including interprofessional learning in the undergraduate
   medical curriculum. The Faculty of Medicine at the University of
   Liverpool organized a pilot two-day multiprofessional course involving
   all the health care related disciplines.
   Objective The present study examined the perceived effect of the
   multiprofessional course on the work practice of these newly qualified
   health care professionals.
   Method The views of former students who took part in the pilot course
   were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule and analysed
   using a qualitative data analysis software package QSR (NUDIST)-D-star.
   Results Two main themes emerged. These centred around role knowledge and
   interprofessional attitudes. Data indicated that participants perceived
   the course to have increased their knowledge of the other professions
   and that this effect had persisted. Reported benefits to their working
   practice included facilitating appropriate referrals, increasing
   professional empathy and awareness of other professionals' skills,
   raising confidence and heightening awareness of the holistic nature of
   patient treatment. Participants reported forming negative attitudes
   towards other professions during their undergraduate education. They
   believed these had been partly encouraged by course tutors. The pilot
   course was perceived to have had had little effect on these attitudes.
   Changes occurred once the newly qualified professionals started work.
   Conclusions The results support the idea that interprofessional
   educational interventions must be tailored to specific learning goals to
   be implemented successfully, and that interprofessional education should
   be prolonged and widespread to have a real impact.}},

Abstract = {{The development of palliative care as a recognizable specialty has been
   supported by an acknowledgment of palliative medicine as a discrete
   discipline within the medical profession. While the knowledge and skills
   required for training in palliative medicine are well defined, there are
   elements of the medical care of people at the end of life that are more
   difficult to outline. Nursing practitioners and academics in particular
   have made important contributions in defining caring as an entity, and
   published work in the field of nursing, bio-ethics and philosophy has
   encouraged an understanding of what caring is and how it is practised.
   However, it has rarely been addressed specifically in the medical
   literature. Undergraduate and postgraduate curricula outline some of the
   attitudes required to practise palliative medicine but the way in which
   doctors learn to care and indeed should care has not been clearly
   detailed. This paper reviews some of the literature pertinent to this
   aspect of palliative care, with particular reference to some of the
   elements that may influence how and why doctors learn to care in the way
   that they do in their practice of medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The role of the general practitioner (GP) has changed
   significantly over the past decade. This problem is compounded by
   growing concern over postgraduate attrition rates from medicine, with
   current estimates as high as 19\%.
   Aim. To define a comprehensive model of the competencies required for
   the job role of GP.
   Method. Three independent studies were conducted to define GP
   competencies including (1) critical incidents focus groups with GPs, (2)
   behavioural coding of GP-patient consultations, and (3) critical
   incidents interviews with patients. Study 1 was conducted with GPs (n =
   35) from the Trent region. Study 2 involved observation of GP-patient
   consultations (n = 33 consultations), and Study 3 was conducted with
   patients (n = 21), all from a Midlandsbased medical practice.
   Results. The data collected from the three studies provided strong
   evidence for a competency model comprising 11 categories with a summary
   of the associated behavioural descriptions. Example competencies
   included empathy and sensitivity, communication skills, clinical
   knowledge and expertise, conceptual thinking, and coping with pressure.
   Conclusions. Triangulation of results was achieved from three
   independent studies. The competencies derived imply that a greater
   account of personal attributes needs to be considered in recruitment and
   training, rather than focusing on academic and clinical competency
   alone. The model could be employed for future research in design of
   selection techniques for the role of GP.}},

Abstract = {{As in many other countries, in Bangladesh there is an increasing public
   dissatisfaction with the medical profession. In the observation of the
   researcher, this dissatisfaction is not due to the lack of clinical
   competence but dire to problems of communication. A qualitative survey
   was done to find out the extent to which the intern doctors display
   communication skills. The study, was conducted among 25 intern doctors
   of Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, Bangladesh by using three sets of
   research instruments. The results indicated that intern doctors were
   very poor in communicating with their patients during history-taking.
   The major incompetences observed in communication skills during
   history-taking were: exploring patients' psychosocial concerns,
   providing empathy, discussing patients' personal issues and beginning
   and ending interviews. Other deficit areas identified were lack of
   warmth towards the patient, failure to keep the patient to relevant
   matters and the use of poor question styles during history-taking. The
   identified areas of deficit in competences in the sample can help to
   derive a prioritized checklist to organize the course content of
   communication skills training for history-taking in Bangladesh.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Quality of clinical interview is a key issue both for
   patient satisfaction and for diagnostic efficiency. Its adequacy relates
   to better clinical diagnosis treatment plans and patient compliance.
   Aim: To measure the quality of interviews performed by medical students
   in three Chilean medical schools before receiving specific training on
   the subject and to compare the scores obtained after introductory
   courses on interview. Material and methods: The interviews were
   videotaped and then evaluated using an objective scale, that measures 33
   skills grouped in six areas: opening, problem exploration, non verbal
   facilitation, interpersonal, patient reaction and closing. The students
   were assigned to an experimental group that receive an interactive
   workshop with roleplays, vignettes and videotape feedback, and to a non
   intervention group that received the usual bedside training on medical
   interviews. Results: Both groups shared the same skill level before the
   training, with better scores on nonverbal, patient reaction and problem
   exploration, and worse ones on closing and interpersonal skills.
   Comparing pre and oast-test results, the overall score improved in the
   experimental group (from 33.2 to 38.3, p=0.002) and worsened among non
   intervened students. There were statistically significant changes for
   opening (p<0.002), problem exploration (p<0.05), non verbal facilitation
   (p<0.0001) and closing (p<0.0001). Conclusions: It is important to train
   students not only in specific knowledge contents but in the process of
   interview. This training should encourage the development of empathy and
   closing skills.}},
