Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze whether patients' perception of their medical
   treatment outcome is higher among patients who experienced a higher
   empathy by trauma surgeons during their stay in hospital.
   Methods: 127 patients were surveyed six weeks after discharge from the
   trauma surgical general ward. Subjective evaluation of medical treatment
   outcome was measured with the corresponding scale from the Cologne
   Patient Questionnaire. Clinical empathy was assessed by using the CARE
   measure. The influence of physician empathy and control variables on a
   dichotomized index of subjective evaluation of medical treatment outcome
   was identified with a logistic regression.
   Results: 120 patients were included in the logistic regression analysis.
   Compared to patients with physician empathy ratings of less than 30
   points, patients with ratings of 41 points or higher have a 20-fold
   higher probability to be in the group with a better medical treatment
   outcome on the CPQ-scale (alpha-level <.001, R-2 46.9).
   Conclusion: Findings emphasize the importance of a well-functioning
   relationship between physician and patient even in a surgical setting
   where the focus is mostly on the bare medical treatment.
   Practice implications: Communication trainings i.e. in surgical
   education can be an effective way to improve the ability to show empathy
   with patients' concerns. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Medical teachers report both positive and negative
   experiences, but these impacts are not well understood. In particular,
   the experience of faculty in relationship-centered education is unknown.
   Purposes: We sought to assess the benefits to teachers of the Healer's
   Art, a popular international medical school elective course. Methods: We
   performed quantitative and qualitative analyses of course evaluations
   completed by 2009-10 Healer's Art faculty from 17 schools. Results:
   Ninety-nine of 117 faculty (84.6\%) completed the evaluation. No
   differences in quantitative responses based on gender, specialty,
   medical school, or year of graduation were observed. Respondents were
   likely or very likely to agree that the course was useful, positively
   impacted clinical work and teaching, and increased overall commitment to
   teaching. In describing the benefits of teaching in the Healer's Art,
   faculty emphasized four themes: Personal Response to Medicine,
   Professional Growth, Greater Connection, and Greater Empathy and Respect
   for Students. Conclusions: Healer's Art faculty report personal and
   professional benefits, as well as increased commitment to teaching and
   to a relationship-centered educational process.}},

Abstract = {{We review clinical care issues that are related to illicit and
   therapeutic opioid use among pregnant women and women in the postpartum
   period and outline the major responsibilities of obstetrics providers
   who care for these patients during the antepartum, intrapartum, and
   postpartum periods. Selected patient treatment issues are highlighted,
   and case examples are provided. Securing a strong rapport and trust with
   these patients is crucial for success in delivering high-quality
   obstetric care and in coordinating services with other specialists as
   needed. Obstetrics providers have an ethical obligation to screen,
   assess, and provide brief interventions and referral to specialized
   treatment for patients with drug use disorders. Opioid-dependent
   pregnant women often can be treated effectively with methadone or
   buprenorphine. These medications are classified as pregnancy category C
   medications by the Food and Drug Administration, and their use in the
   treatment of opioid-dependent pregnant patients should not be considered
   ``off-label.{''} Except in rare special circumstances,
   medication-assisted withdrawal during pregnancy should be discouraged
   because of a high relapse rate. Acute pain management in this population
   deserves special consideration because patients who use opioids can be
   hypersensitive to pain and because the use of mixed
   opioid-agonist/antagonists can precipitate opioid withdrawal. In the
   absence of other indications, pregnant women who use opioids do not
   require more intense medical care than other pregnant patients to ensure
   adequate treatment and the best possible outcomes. Together with
   specialists in pain and addiction medicine, obstetricians can coordinate
   comprehensive care for pregnant women who use opioids and women who use
   opioids in the postpartum period.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The patient-physician encounter is the pivotal starting point of any
   healthcare delivery, but it is subject to multiple process breakdowns
   and prevalent suboptimal performance. An overview of the techniques and
   components of a successful encounter valid for every setting and readily
   applicable is presented, stressing 7 rules: (1) ensuring optimal
   environment, tools, and teamwork; (2) viewing each encounter not only as
   a cognitive/biomedical challenge, but also as a personal one, and a
   learning opportunity; (3) adopting an attitude of curiosity,
   concentration, compassion, and commitment, and maintaining a systematic,
   orderly approach; (4) ``simple is beautiful{''}-making the most of the
   basic clinical data and their many unique advantages; (5) minding ``the
   silent dimension{''}-being attentive to the patient's identity and
   emotions; (6) following the ``Holy Trinity{''} of gathering all
   information, consulting databases/colleagues, and tailoring gained
   knowledge to the individual patient; and (7) using the encounter as a
   ``window of opportunity{''} to further the patient's health-not just the
   major problem, by addressing screening and prevention; promoting health
   literacy and shared decision- making; and establishing proper follow-up.
   Barriers to implementation identified can be overcome by continuous
   educational interventions. A high-quality encounter sets a virtuous
   cycle of patient-provider interaction and results in increasing
   satisfaction, adherence, and improved health outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   DEPARTMENT PATIENTS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{456-464}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient satisfaction with emergency care is associated with
   timeliness of care, empathy, technical competence, and information
   delivery. Previous studies have demonstrated inconsistent findings
   regarding the association between pain management and patient
   satisfaction. Objectives: This study was undertaken to determine the
   association between pain management and patient satisfaction among
   Emergency Department (ED) patients presenting with acute painful
   conditions. Methods: In this survey study, a standardized interview was
   conducted at the Emergency Department at the University of Toledo
   Medical Center in May-July 2011. Participants were asked to answer 18
   questions pertaining to patient satisfaction. Additional data collected
   included demographic information, pain scores, and clinical management.
   Results: Among 328 eligible participants, 289 (88\%) participated. The
   mean triage pain score on the verbal numeric rating scale was 8.2 and
   the mean discharge score was 6.0. The majority of patients (52\%)
   experienced a reduction in pain of 2 or more points. Participants
   received one pain medication dose (44\%), two medication doses (14\%),
   three medication doses (5\%), or four medication doses (2\%). Reduction
   in pain scores of 2 or more points was associated with a higher number
   of medications administered. Reduction in pain scores was associated
   with higher satisfaction as scored on questions of patient perceptions
   of adequate assessment and response to pain, and treatment of pain.
   Conclusions: There was a significant association between patient
   satisfaction and a reduction in pain of 2 or more points and number of
   medications administered. Effective pain management is associated with
   improved patient satisfaction among ED patients with painful conditions.

Abstract = {{Context The paper refers to the increased competition between health
   care providers and the need for patient-centred services in Greece.
   Using service quality methodology, this paper investigates service
   quality perceptions of patients in Greek public primary health centres.
   Objective To test the internal consistency and applicability of SERVQUAL
   in primary health care centres in Greece. Strategy SERVQUAL was used to
   examine whether patients have different expectations from health care
   providers and whether different groups of patients may consider some
   dimensions of care more important than others. Results The analysis
   showed that there were gaps in all dimensions measured by SERVQUAL. The
   largest gap was detected in empathy. Further analysis showed that there
   were also differences depending on gender, age and education levels. A
   separate analysis of expectations and perceptions revealed that this gap
   was because of differences in patients' perceptions rather than
   expectations. Discussion and conclusions This paper raises a number of
   issues that concern the applicability of SERVQUAL in health care
   services and could enhance current discussions about SERVQUAL
   improvement. Quality of health care needs to be redefined by
   encompassing multiple dimensions. Beyond a simple
   expectations-perceptions gap, people may hold different understandings
   of health care that, in turn, influence their perception of the quality
   of services.}},

Title = {{The temporal decline of idealism in two cohorts of medical students at
   one institution}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: A number of studies have indicated that students lose
   idealistic motivations over the course of medical education, with some
   identifying the initiation of this decline as occurring as early as the
   second year of the traditional US curricula. This study builds on prior
   work testing the hypothesis that a decline in medical student idealism
   is detectable in the first two years of medical school.
   Methods: The original study sought to identify differences in survey
   responses between first-year (MS1) and second-year (MS2) medical
   students at the beginning and end of academic year 2010, on three
   proxies for idealism. The current study extends that work by
   administering the same survey items to the same student cohorts at the
   end of their third and fourth years (MS3 and MS4), respectively. Survey
   topics included questions on: (a) motivations for pursuing a medical
   career; (b) specialty choice; and (c) attitudes toward primary care.
   Principle component analysis was used to extract linear composite
   variables (LCVs) from responses to each group of questions. Linear
   regression was then used to test the effect of the six
   cohort/time-points on each composite variable, controlling for
   demographic characteristics.
   Results: Idealism in medicine decreased (beta = -.113, p<.001) while
   emphasis on employment and job security increased (beta =.146, p<.001)
   as motivators of pursuing a career in medicine at each medical school
   stage and time period. Students were more likely to be motivated by
   student debt over interest in content in specialty choice (beta = .077,
   p = .004) across medical school stages. Negative attitudes towards
   primary care were most sensitive to MS group and time effects. Both
   negative/antagonistic views (beta = .142, p<.001) and
   negative/sympathetic views (beta = .091, p<.001) of primary care
   increased over each stage.
   Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence that declines in
   medical student idealism may occur as early as the second year of
   medical education. Additionally, as students make choices in their
   medical careers, such as specialty choice or consideration of primary
   care, the influences of job security, student debt and social status

Title = {{An obesity educational intervention for medical students addressing
   weight bias and communication skills using standardized patients}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: In order to manage the increasing worldwide problem of
   obesity, medical students will need to acquire the knowledge and skills
   necessary to assess and counsel patients with obesity. Few educational
   intervention studies have been conducted with medical students
   addressing stigma and communication skills with patients who are
   overweight or obese. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes
   in students' attitudes and beliefs about obesity, and their confidence
   in communication skills after a structured educational intervention that
   included a clinical encounter with an overweight standardized patient
   (SP).
   Methods: First year medical students (n = 127, 47\% female) enrolled in
   a communications unit were instructed to discuss the SPs' overweight
   status and probe about their perceptions of being overweight during an 8
   minute encounter. Prior to the session, students were asked to read two
   articles on communication and stigma as background information.
   Reflections on the readings and their performance with the SP were
   conducted prior to and after the encounter when students met in small
   groups. A newly constructed 16 item questionnaire was completed before,
   immediately after and one year after the session. Scale analysis was
   performed based on a priori classification of item intent.
   Results: Three scales emerged from the questionnaire: negative obesity
   stereotyping (7 items), empathy (3 items), and counseling confidence (3
   items). There were small but significant immediate post- intervention
   improvements in stereotyping (p =.002) and empathy (p <.0001) and a very
   large mean improvement in confidence (p <.0001). Significant improvement
   between baseline and immediate follow- up responses were maintained for
   empathy and counseling at one year after the encounter but stereotyping
   reverted to the baseline mean. Percent of students with improved scale
   scores immediately and at one year follow up were as follows:
   stereotyping 53.1\% and 57.8\%; empathy 48.4\% and 47.7\%; and
   confidence 86.7\% and 85.9\%.
   Conclusions: A structured encounter with an overweight SP was associated
   with a significant short- term decrease in negative stereotyping, and
   longer- term increase in empathy and raised confidence among first year
   medical students toward persons who are obese. The encounter was most
   effective for increasing confidence in counseling skills. Keywords:

Title = {{Associations between Medical Student Empathy and Personality: A
   Multi-Institutional Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: More empathetic physicians are more likely to achieve higher
   patient satisfaction, adherence to treatments, and health outcomes. In
   the context of medical education, it is thus important to understand how
   personality might condition the empathetic development of medical
   students. Single institutional evidence shows associations between
   students' personality and empathy. This multi-institutional study aimed
   to assess such associations across institutions, looking for personality
   differences between students with high empathy and low empathy levels.
   Methods: Participants were 472 students from three medical schools in
   Portugal. They completed validated adaptations to Portuguese of
   self-report measures of the NEO-Five Factor Inventory(NEO-FFI) and the
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy(JSPE-spv). Students were
   categorized into two groups: ``Bottom{''} (low empathy, N = 165) and
   ``Top{''} (high empathy, N = 169) according to their empathy JSPE-spv
   total score terciles. Correlation analysis, binary logistic regression
   analysis and ROC curve analysis were conducted.
   Results: A regression model with gender, age and university had a
   predictive power (pseudo R2) for belonging to the top or bottom group of
   6.4\%. The addition of personality dimensions improved the predictive
   power to 16.8\%. Openness to experience and Agreeableness were important
   to predict top or bottom empathy scores when gender, age and university
   were considered.{''} Based on the considered predictors the model
   correctly classified 69.3\% of all students.
   Conclusions: The present multi-institutional cross-sectional study in
   Portugal revealed across-school associations between the Big5 dimensions
   Agreeableness and Openness to experience and the empathy of medical
   students and that personality made a significant contribution to
   identify the more empathic students. Therefore, medical schools may need
   to pay attention to the personality of medical students to understand
   how to enhance the empathy of medical students.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Effective communication is an essential skill in general practice
   consultations. The art of communication is the development of effective
   skills and finding a style of communication that suits the clinician and
   produces benefits for both patient and doctor.
   Objective
   This paper outlines the essential skills required for effective
   communication with a patient and suggests that clinicians consider this
   communication as an art that can be developed throughout a medical
   career.
   Discussion
   Good communication can improve outcomes for patients and doctors, and
   deserves equal importance as developing clinical knowledge and
   procedural skill. The importance of good communication is so critical
   that Australian guidelines list effective communication as part of the
   required conduct for all doctors.
   A therapeutic patient doctor relationship uses the clinician as a
   therapeutic intervention and is part of the art of communication.
   Despite all the technological advances of recent decades, caring,
   compassionate, healing doctors remain the best therapeutic tool in
   medicine. The ability of a doctor to provide comfort through their
   presence and their words is a fundamental component of good medical
   care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The issues of medical errors and medical malpractice have
   stimulated significant interest in establishing transparency in health
   care, in other words, ensuring that medical professionals formally
   report medical errors and disclose related outcomes to patients and
   families. However, research has amply shown that transparency is not a
   universal practice among physicians. Methods A review of the literature
   was carried out using the search terms ``transparency,{''} ``patient
   safety,{''} ``disclosure,{''} ``medical error,{''} ``error
   reporting,{''} ``medical malpractice,{''} ``doctor-patient
   relationship,{''} and ``physician{''} to find articles describing
   physician barriers to transparency. Results The current literature
   underscores that a complex Web of factors influence physician reluctance
   to engage in transparency. Specifically, 4 domains of barriers emerged
   from this analysis: intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, and
   societal. Conclusion Transparency initiatives will require vigorous,
   interdisciplinary efforts to address the systemic and pervasive nature
   of the problem. Several ethical and social-psychological barriers
   suggest that medical schools and hospitals should collaborate to
   establish continuity in education and ensure that knowledge acquired in
   early education is transferred into long-term learning. At the
   institutional level, practical and cultural barriers suggest the
   creation of supportive learning environments and private discussion
   forums where physicians can seek moral support in the aftermath of an
   error. To overcome resistance to culture transformation, incremental
   change should be considered, for example, replacing arcane transparency
   policies and complex reporting mechanisms with clear, user-friendly
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Medical practitioners do not for a long time pay enough attention to
   patient's pain. This approach is in the line of society feelings. Pain
   was long consider to be a contingency to withstand as showed in
   Christian's bible or Stoicism's principle. Changes in mentality appear
   in present times. It seems obvious that for sociological and scientific
   reasons pain's care in medical and psychiatric disorders is now an
   important subject. Recent research in autistic disorders suggest that
   insensitivity observed in autism is not an analgesic phenomenon but a
   different behavioral reactivity to pain. Prevalence of schizophrenic
   disorder is from 0.5 to 1\%. It is also a complex disorder that has
   defied decades of concerted efforts to uncover its origins and attenuate
   its symptoms. The most promising hypotheses suggest that
   neurodevelopmental impairment increases the risk of later schizophrenia.
   Most of recent researches in this topic did focus to trait or state
   markers. According to the vulnerability models of schizophrenia, trait
   markers are clinical, psychological, physiological, anatomical or
   cognitive impairments found in patients with schizophrenia during all
   the course of the illness and even before the onset. Several lines of
   evidence (case report, epidemiological studies, experimental studies)
   suggest that patients with schizophrenia show a relative insensitivity
   to physical pain. We will review and critic the scientific literature in
   this specific topic. We will see if data are relevant with the
   neurodevelopmental hypothesis and vulnerability models. Articles are
   separated in 2 groups, first are clinical or epidemiological studies,
   and second are experimental studies. Clinical and experimental data
   strongly suggest a decrease of behavioural reactivity to pain (BRP) but
   there is a lack of argument to prove a real analgesia. Because
   schizophrenia is a severe decease with impairment in communication and
   social skills, it may be very difficult to affirm that the insensitivity
   to pain does really exist for patients. It seems inappropriate at this
   point to speak about insensitivity or analgesia. We could hypothesis
   that the decrease of BRP is less a consequence of analgesia than a
   different way to express emotion in general and pain in particular. It
   is well known that patients with schizophrenia show communication and
   thinking impairment, not adapted social skills and also a lack of body
   representation. However, this decrease of behavioral response seems to
   be frequent and may be explored by objective research protocol to
   understand if patients don't feel pain or probably don't express pain by
   adapted social skills. Furthermore, decrease of BRP may take place in a
   comprehensive theory of schizophrenia in the line of
   stress-vulnerability model. Impairment or lack of behavioral pain
   reactivity could induce an increasing anxiety level for patient with
   vulnerability to schizophrenia and a higher risk of onset of the
   pathology. We may argue that pain stimuli would conduct to a nociceptive
   stress witch couldn't discharge by usual ways of regulation and
   behavioral expression of pain. Recent research regarding empathy in
   patients with schizophrenia may be a relevant approach for understanding
   the un-specificity of pain reactivity impairment in these patients. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Recent research in allopathic medical schools has indicated
   a decline in empathy amongst medical students during their first year of
   clinical rotations. Further studies have also found that this decline in
   empathy continues throughout residency training.
   Objective: To determine if the declining empathy present in allopathic
   medical schools is occurring in our osteopathic institution and to
   establish the most effective way of collecting information regarding
   empathy from our medical student population.
   Design: A questionnaire regarding empathy was completed by third year
   medical students following lecture and group-format sessions focused on
   improving awareness and willingness to use motivational interviewing for
   health promotion and prevention, in the context of cultural sensitivity
   and sensibility.
   Participants: Seventy third year medical students at our osteopathic
   teaching institution.
   Results: Questionnaire responses indicated that a larger percentage of
   students in the third year class at our institution were found not to be
   exhibiting empathy compared to those who were empathetic.
   Conclusions: Third year osteopathic medical students exhibited decreased
   empathy in their questionnaire responses. Although preliminary, this
   finding lays the groundwork for further studies that will lead to the
   implementation of educational methods to promote empathy and aid
   students in developing an empathetic way with their patients, early on
   in their education. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundQuestions remain about how brief motivational interventions
   (BMIs) for unhealthy alcohol use work, and addressing these questions
   may be important for improving their efficacy. Therefore, we assessed
   the effects of various characteristics of BMIs on drinking outcomes
   across 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
   MethodsAudio recordings of 314 BMIs were coded. We used the global
   rating scales of the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC) 2.1:
   counselor's acceptance, empathy, and motivational interviewing (MI)
   spirit, and patient's self-exploration were rated. MI proficiency was
   defined as counselor's rating scale scores 5. We also used the
   structure, confrontation, and advice subscale scores of the Therapy
   Process Rating Scale and the Working Alliance Inventory. We examined
   these process characteristics in interventions across 1 U.S. RCT of
   middle-aged medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use (n=124) and 2
   Swiss RCTs of young men with binge drinking in a nonclinical setting:
   Swiss-one (n=62) and Swiss-two (n=128). We assessed the associations
   between these characteristics and drinks/d reported by participants 3 to
   6months after study entry.
   ResultsIn all 3 RCTs, mean MISC counselor's rating scales scores were
   consistent with MI proficiency. In overdispersed Poisson regression
   models, most BMI characteristics were not significantly associated with
   drinks/d in follow-up. In the U.S. RCT, confrontation and
   self-exploration were associated with more drinking. Giving advice was
   significantly associated with less drinking in the Swiss-one RCT.
   Contrary to expectations, MI spirit was not consistently associated with
   drinking across studies.
   ConclusionsAcross different populations and settings, intervention
   characteristics viewed as central to efficacious BMIs were neither
   robust nor consistent predictors of drinking outcome. Although there may
   be alternative reasons why the level of MI processes was not predictive
   of outcomes in these studies (limited variability in scores), efforts to
   understand what makes BMIs efficacious may require attention to factors
   beyond intervention process characteristics typically examined.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Truth-telling is a complex task requiring multiple skills in
   communication, understanding, and empathy. Its application in the
   context of breaking bad news (BBN) is distressing and problematic if
   conducted with insufficient skills.
   Purpose: We investigated the long-term influence of a simulated
   patient-based teaching intervention integrating the learning of
   communication skills within an ethical reflection on students' ethical
   attitudes towards truth-telling, perceived competence and comfort in
   BBN.
   Methods: We followed two cohorts of medical students from the
   preclinical third year to their clinical rotations (fifth year). We
   analysed their ethical attitudes and level of comfort and competence in
   BBN before, after the intervention, and during clinical rotations.
   Results: Students' ethical attitudes towards truth-telling remained
   stable. Students feeling uncomfortable or incompetent improved their
   level of perceived comfort or competence after the intervention, but
   those feeling comfortable or competent became more aware of the
   difficulty of the situation, and consequently decreased their level of
   comfort and competence.
   Conclusions: Confronting students with a realistic situation and
   integrating the practice of communication skills within an ethical
   reflection may be effective in maintaining ethical attitudes towards
   truth-telling, in developing new skills and increasing awareness about
   the difficulty and challenges of a BBN situation.}},

Abstract = {{We measure here the impact of training sessions in announcing a lymphoma
   on the empathy of 5th year medical students. The training in making the
   announcement to simulated patients was performed in small groups and
   filmed. These sessions were completely integrated in the other
   activities that the doctor must carry out with a patient (medical
   consulting, questioning and clinical examination, prescription of
   additional tests, analysis and comments on these, planning the
   announcement, and the announcement itself to a close relative).
   Jefferson's Empathy Scale was evaluated before and after the training.
   The empathy of medical students measured using this scale increased
   significantly after the training. The impact of this training on the
   students who played the patient and his/her companion was also evaluated
   using this tool. The results are placed in the context of previous work
   on the training of doctors in communication. The question of medical
   empathy is also discussed.}},

Title = {{Burnout in Pediatric Residents Over a 2-Year Period: A Longitudinal
   Study}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{167-172}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Burnout is a work-related syndrome characterized by emotional
   exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and lack of personal
   accomplishment (PA). We hypothesized that the transition into an
   environment of high physical, intellectual, and emotional demands of the
   medical profession would lead to an increase in the prevalence of
   burnout in pediatric residents, which would remain high throughout
   residency.
   METHODS: The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was administered to
   pediatric residents at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital 6 times
   between February 2010 and February 2012. These times corresponded to the
   start of residency, mid-intern year, end-intern year, mid-junior year,
   end-junior year, and mid-senior year.
   RESULTS: Mean values of burnout components changed significantly between
   the start of residency and mid-intern year. BE increased from 15.8 to
   24.5 (P < .001), DP increased from 4.5 to 9.2 (P < .001), and PA
   decreased from 40.2 to 38.3 (P = .04). Similarly, the prevalence of
   burnout increased from 17\% to 46\% (P = .012), or 2\% to 24\% (P =
   .002) using more restrictive criteria, between the start of residency
   and mid-intern year. Significant changes in mean scores or prevalence of
   burnout were not found between any other consecutive times throughout
   residency.
   CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study documented a significant increase
   in the components of burnout among pediatric residents between the start
   of residency and mid-intern year, which persisted through the PGY2 and
   PGY3 years. Further studies are warranted to identify correlates of
   resident burnout and to develop preventative strategies to reduce its
   occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{The manner in which physicians deliver difficult diagnoses is an area of
   discontent for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The
   American Academy of Neurology's Practice Parameter for care of the ALS
   Patient recommended teaching and evaluating strategies for disclosing
   the diagnosis (10). Our objective was to examine residents' ability in
   and perceptions of communicating the diagnosis of ALS. Twenty-two
   resident physicians were videotaped and rated by two ALS neurologists as
   they delivered an ALS diagnosis to a standardized patient (SP) during an
   objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Residents self-rated
   immediately after the OSCE, again after viewing their videotape, and
   completed a survey regarding the OSCE and delivering difficult
   diagnoses. OSCE performance was suboptimal, particularly for
   communication skills and empathy. The two examiners' scores correlated
   except for the empathy subscore. Residents' self-assessments did not
   align with the examiners' scores either before or after watching their
   videotape. The survey uncovered residents' apprehension and
   dissatisfaction with their training in diagnosis delivery. The results
   highlight a need for resident education in delivering an ALS diagnosis.
   The lack of correlation between residents' and examiners' scoring
   requires further study. Evaluation of empathy is particularly
   challenging. Residents agreed that OSCE participation was worthwhile.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of the personalities of medical students can enable medical
   educators to formulate strategies for the best development of academic
   and clinical competencies. Previous research has shown that medical
   students do not share a common personality profile, there being gender
   differences. We have also shown that, for French medical students,
   students with personality traits associated with strong competitiveness
   are selected for admission to medical school. In this study, we further
   show that the medical students have different personality profiles
   compared with other student groups (psychology and business studies).
   The main purpose of the present investigation was to assess attitudes to
   science and gross anatomy, and to relate these to the students'
   personalities. Questionnaires (including Thurstone and Chave analyses)
   were employed to measure attitudes, and personality was assessed using
   the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Data for attitudes were obtained for
   students at medical schools in Cardiff (UK), Paris, Descartes/Sorbonne
   (France), St George's University (Grenada) and Ankara (Turkey). Data
   obtained from personality tests were available for analysis from the
   Parisian cohort of students. Although the medical students were found to
   have strongly supportive views concerning the importance of science in
   medicine, their knowledge of the scientific method/philosophy of science
   was poor. Following analyses of the BFI in the French students,
   openness' and conscientiousness' were linked statistically with a
   positive attitude towards science. For anatomy, again strongly
   supportive views concerning the subject's importance in medicine were
   discerned. Analyses of the BFI in the French students did not show links
   statistically between personality profiles and attitudes towards gross
   anatomy, except male students with negative affectivity' showed less
   appreciation of the importance of anatomy. This contrasts with our
   earlier studies that showed that there is a relationship between the BF
   dimensions of personality traits and anxiety towards the dissection room
   experience (at the start of the course, negative emotionality' was
   related to an increased level of anxiety). We conclude that medical
   students agree on the importance to their studies of both science in
   general and gross anatomy in particular, and that some personality
   traits relate to their attitudes that could affect clinical competence.}},

Abstract = {{The multiple mini-interview (MMI) has become an increasingly popular
   admissions method for selecting prospective students into professional
   programs (e.g., medical school). The MMI uses a series of short, labour
   intensive simulation stations and scenario interviews to more
   effectively assess applicants' non-cognitive qualities such as empathy,
   critical thinking, integrity, and communication. MMI data from 455
   medical school applicants were analyzed using: (1) Generalizability
   Theory to estimate the generalizability of the MMI and identify sources
   of error; and (2) the Many-Facet Rasch Model, to identify misfitting
   examinees, items and raters. Consistent with previous research, our
   results support the reliability of MMI process. However, it appears that
   the non-cognitive qualities are not being measured as unique constructs

Abstract = {{The initial findings from 230 questionnaires' survey and 36 interviews,
   in which informants are CWD, children with non-disabilities (CWND),
   parents of CWD, and teachers in school settings, are stated as: (a) the

   individual model rather than social model, such understandings
   contribute great impacts to the CWD's experiences in their daily life in
   general and in school contexts in particular; (b) the most important
   difficulties which CWD experience at school are those of learning
   facilities, the empathy from their student peers and barriers in the
   physical environment; (c) the ways which CWD try to deal with such
   difficulties are mostly `do-by-themselves' or try to adapt themselves
   rather than asking for supports actively. Based on these findings,
   recommendations for having further activities to change social awareness
   of disabilities, specific support structures for CWD and school staff

Abstract = {{Intensive care medicine has made great contributions to the immense
   success of modern curative medicine. However, emotional care and empathy
   for the patient and his family seem to be sparse. There is an assumed
   constraint to objectivity and efficiency, as well as a massive economic
   pressure which transfers the physician into an agent of the disease
   instead of a trustee of the ill human being. The physician struggles
   against the disease and feels the death of his patient as his personal
   defeat. However, in futile situations the intensivist must learn to let
   go. He is responsible for futile overtreatment as well as for successful
   treatment.
   Today, in futile situations in the intensive care unit (ICU), it is
   possible to change the goal from curative treatment to palliative care.
   This is a consequent further development from critical care medicine. In
   end-of-life situations in the intensive care unit, emotional care and
   empathy are mandatory using intensive dialogues with the family. Despite
   great workload stress enough time for such conversation should be taken,
   because the physician will generously be repaid by the way he sees his
   medical activity. The maintenance of a culture of empathy within the
   intensive care team is a major task for the leader. In this manner, the
   ICU will become and remain a place for living humanity.}},

   Results. No differences in empathic orientation were observed among
   courses and between sexes, but differences were found in schools of
   medicine considered as a unit in each studied country.
   Conclusions. Empathic orientation levels tend to reduce as courses
   advance. This was observed in both male and female students and in all

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe pathways through which clinicians can more
   effectively respond to patients' emotions in ways that contribute to
   betterment of the patient's health and well-being.
   Methods: A representative review of literature on managing emotions in
   clinical consultations was conducted.
   Results: A three-stage, conceptual model for assisting clinicians to
   more effectively address the challenges of recognizing, exploring, and
   managing cancer patients' emotional distress in the clinical encounter
   was developed. To enhance and enact recognition of patients' emotions,
   clinicians can engage in mindfulness, self-situational awareness, active
   listening, and facilitative communication. To enact exploration,
   clinicians can acknowledge and validate emotions and provide empathy.
   Finally, clinicians can provide information empathetically, identify
   therapeutic resources, and give referrals and interventions as needed to
   help lessen patients' emotional distress.
   Conclusion: This model serves as a framework for future research
   examining pathways that link clinicians' emotional cue recognition to
   patient-centered responses exploring a patient's emotional distress to
   therapeutic actions that contribute to improved psychological and
   emotional health.
   Practical implications: Specific communicative and cognitive strategies
   are presented that can help clinicians better recognize a patient's
   emotional distress and respond in ways that have therapeutic value.

Abstract = {{Empathy is an important attribute in medicine, influencing both the
   process and outcome of consultations. However, there are no validated
   tools available in Japan to gather patient feedback on physicians
   empathy. The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure
   developed in the UK is widely used internationally.
   To investigate the psychometric properties of a Japanese version of the
   CARE Measure.
   Following two cycles of translation and back translation, the Japanese
   CARE Measure was completed by 317 patients in a primary medical care
   clinic in Japan. Tests of internal reliability and validity included
   Cronbachs alpha, item-total correlations and factor analysis. Predicted
   associations between CARE Measure score and other variables were
   assessed by Spearmans rho.
   Low numbers of missing values (8.29.8\%) and not applicable responses
   (01.3\%) suggested high acceptability and face validity of the Japanese
   CARE Measure. Internal reliability was high (Cronbachs alpha 0.984) and
   was reduced by the removal of any of 10 items. High corrected item-total
   correlations (0.8970.946) suggested homogeneity. Factor analysis showed
   a single solution with high item loadings (0.9170.957). Construct
   validity was supported by a significant relationship (Spearmans rho
   0.74, P < 0.001) with overall satisfaction with the consultation.
   The Japanese CARE Measure appears to be valid and reliable in a primary
   medical care setting. Further work is required to determine its ability
   to discriminate between doctors.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Communication with patients and families is an essential
   component of high-quality care in serious illness. Small-group skills
   training can result in new communication behaviors, but past studies
   have used facilitators with extensive experience, raising concerns this
   is not scalable. Objective: The objective was to investigate the effect
   of an experiential communication skills building workshop (Codetalk),
   led by newly trained facilitators, on internal medicine trainees' and
   nurse practitioner students' ability to communicate bad news and express
   empathy. Design: Trainees participated in Codetalk; skill improvement
   was evaluated through pre- and post- standardized patient (SP)
   encounters. Setting and subjects: The subjects were internal medicine
   residents and nurse practitioner students at two universities.
   Intervention and measurements: The study was carried out in anywhere
   from five to eight half-day sessions over a month. The first and last
   sessions included audiotaped trainee SP encounters coded for effective
   communication behaviors. The primary outcome was change in communication
   scores from pre-intervention to post-intervention. We also measured
   trainee characteristics to identify predictors of performance and change
   in performance over time. Results: We enrolled 145 trainees who
   completed pre- and post-intervention SP interviewswith participation
   rates of 52\% for physicians and 14\% for nurse practitioners. Trainees'
   scores improved in 8 of 11 coded behaviors (p<0.05). The only
   significant predictors of performance were having participated in the
   intervention (p<0.001) and study site (p<0.003). The only predictor of
   improvement in performance over time was participating in the
   intervention (p<0.001). Conclusions: A communication skills intervention
   using newly trained facilitators was associated with improvement in
   trainees' skills in giving bad news and expressing empathy. Improvement
   in communication skills did not vary by trainee characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the vaginal speculum was as important to Victorian doctors
   who struggled to professionalise the fields of gynaecology and
   obstetrics as it was controversial, especially when such doctors were
   men attending to women of respectable class status. While the debate
   over the use of the speculum in Victorian Britain was certainly rooted
   in moral concerns over the exposure of women's bodies, an examination of
   the arguments made by Victorian medical men concerning the use of the
   instrument reveals that there was more than just modesty at stake. This
   article will consider how the nineteenth century texts that articulate
   different positions regarding the use of the speculum in gynaecological
   examinations also demonstrate important tensions relating to the
   privileging of the sense of sight versus touch in Victorian medicine,
   particularly when referring to the respective utility and purpose of a
   male doctor's visual or tactile knowledge of the inside of a woman's

Title = {{On death and dying - an exploratory and evaluative study of a
   reflective, interdisciplinary course element in undergraduate anatomy
   teaching}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Teaching in palliative care aims not only at providing
   students with specialized knowledge insymptom therapy in advanced
   disease but also at developing a professional attitude consistent with
   the principles and philosophy of palliative care. Reflecting about one's
   own or the patient's death and dying is considered essential for
   empathic patient care. In medical education the dissection course is
   often the first encounter with the issue of death and dying and
   represents a significant emotional challenge to many medical students.
   Against this background we implemented a new course element in
   preparation for the dissection course offering opportunity to reflect
   own experiences with death and dying and providing support in finding a
   balance between authentic empathy and pragmatic action towards deceased
   persons. We discuss issues such as dignity and professional distance and
   reason whether guided support for medical students regarding these
   issues might influence their future attitude as doctors caring for their
   patients.
   Methods: In tandem we performed a formal evaluation of the seminar and
   explored the students' experiences with death and dying their
   expectations and fears in the run-up to the dissection course and their
   attitude towards dissection.
   Results: This article describes the structure and the concept of this
   new interdisciplinary course element and presents the results of the
   formal course evaluation as well as the explorative part of the
   accompanying research. Medical students had broad experiences with death
   and dying even before the dissection course. 89.1\% of students had
   worried about some kind of emotional stress during the dissection course
   before but 61.7\% stated to have actually perceived emotional stress
   afterwards. The willingness to donate one's own body for anatomy
   purposes decreased significantly during the course. The given room for
   reflection and discussion was appreciated by the students who felt that
   the effects of this seminar might be of use even beyond the dissection
   course.
   Conclusion: This new course element successfully assisted medical
   students during the dissection room experience and gave opportunity to
   reflection and discussion on death and dying. The accompanying research
   confirmed the demand for support and gave insight into experiences
   emotions and attitudes of medical students.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is defined as an individually varying but stable personality
   trait. To our knowledge this notion seems questionable considering
   recent studies proving neuronal plasticity not only in childhood and
   adolescence but over the whole lifespan. We propose a model in which an
   individual's basic empathic abilitiesarising from genetic factors, brain
   maturation, and early attachment experiences are continually modulated
   by the intensity, continuity, and frequency of interpersonal
   socio-emotional stimulation and challenges. We assume neural processes
   and their underlying neural structures being modified by social and
   socio-emotional stimulation. Continuous social interactions should
   produce noticeable effects on the empathic abilities of an individual
   independent of age or brain maturation level. In particular, empathic
   abilities should be learnable and expandable beyond specific
   developmental windows. To elucidate this hypothesis we surveyed empathy
   measures of students of various professions with the help of a new
   instrument, the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE)
   categorizing them into three different groups depending on their
   subsequent occupational fields: medical students, students of academic
   social professions, and a control group. Results indicate that
   continuous socio-emotional stimulation could increase empathic abilities
   potentially leading to learning effects.}},

Abstract = {{Veterinary graduates require effective communication skills training to
   successfully transition from university into practice. Although the
   literature has supported the need for veterinary student communication
   skills training programs, there is minimal research using learning
   theory to design programs and explore students' perceptions of such
   programs. This study investigated veterinary students' perceptions of
   (1) their communication skills and (2) the usefulness of a communication
   skills training program designed with Kolb's Experiential Learning
   Theory (ELT) as a framework and implemented in a primary care setting.
   Twenty-nine final-year veterinary students from the Ontario Veterinary
   College attended a 3-week communication skills training rotation. Pre-
   and post-training surveys explored their communication objectives,
   confidence in their communication skills, and the usefulness of specific
   communication training strategies. The results indicated that both
   before and after training, students were most confident in building
   rapport, displaying empathy, recognizing how bonded a client is with his
   or her pet, and listening. They were least confident in managing clients
   who were angry or not happy with the charges and who monopolized the
   appointment. Emotionally laden topics, such as breaking bad news and
   managing euthanasia discussions, were also identified as challenging and
   in need of improvement. Interactive small-group discussions and review
   of video-recorded authentic client appointments were most valuable for
   their learning and informed students' self-awareness of their non-verbal
   communication. These findings support the use of Kolb's ELT as a
   theoretical framework and of video review and reflection to guide
   veterinary students' learning of communication skills in a primary care
   setting.}},

Journal = {{PATIENT PREFERENCE AND ADHERENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{1239-1253}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate accident casualties' long-term subjective
   evaluation of treatment outcome 6 weeks and 12 months after discharge
   and its relation to the experienced surgeon's empathy during hospital
   treatment after trauma in consideration of patient-, injury-, and
   health-related factors. The long-term results are compared to the 6-week
   follow-up outcomes.
   Patients and methods: Two hundred and seventeen surgery patients were
   surveyed at 6 weeks, and 206 patients at 12 months after discharge from
   the trauma surgical general ward. The subjective evaluation of medical
   treatment outcome was measured 6 weeks and 12 months after discharge
   with the respective scale from the Cologne Patient Questionnaire.
   Physician Empathy was assessed with the Consultation and Relational
   Empathy Measure. The correlation between physician empathy and control
   variables with the subjective evaluation of medical treatment outcome 12
   months after discharge was identified by means of logistic regression
   analysis under control of sociodemographic and injury-related factors.
   Results: One hundred and thirty-six patients were included within the
   logistic regression analysis at the 12-month follow-up. Compared to the
   6-week follow-up, the level of subjective evaluation of medical
   treatment outcome was slightly lower and the association with physician
   empathy was weaker. Compared to patients who rated the empathy of their
   surgeon lower than 31 points, patients with ratings of 41 points or
   higher had a 4.2-fold higher probability to be in the group with a
   better medical treatment outcome (3.5 and above) on the Cologne Patient
   Questionnaire scale 12 months after discharge from hospital (P=0.009,
   R-2=33.5, 95\% confidence interval: 1.440-12.629).
   Conclusion: Physician empathy is the strongest predictor for a higher
   level of trauma patients' subjective evaluation of treatment outcome 6
   weeks and 12 months after discharge from the hospital. Interpersonal
   factors between surgeons and their patients are possible key levers for
   improving patient outcomes in an advanced health system. Communication
   trainings for surgeons might prepare them to react appropriately to
   their patients' needs and lead to satisfactory outcomes for both
   parties.}},

Abstract = {{Pressures related to medical training influence individual experiences
   in the course of study, which in turn can lead to changes in students'
   professional attitudes. Purposes: The aim of this investigation was to
   explore expectations, experiences, and attitude changes among Polish
   students as they progressed through a medical university. Methods: The
   study used a longitudinal approach in which the same cohort of students
   was surveyed over time, with the same questionnaire administered, at the
   end of Year 1 and Year 6. Results: The results showed that the disparity
   between students' expectations about studying medicine and the reality
   increased between Year 1 and Year 6 (p <.0001). The biggest gap
   concerned ``technical support{''} and ``contacts with faculty{''}-the
   observed effect size was medium with the respective Cohen's d values
   0.507 and 0.368. Students in Year 1 were most disappointed by the ``lack
   of support from faculty and their lack of interest in teaching,{''}
   whereas, in Year 6, students were most concerned about an approach to
   teaching that equipped them in theoretical knowledge at the expense of
   practical skills. Students in Year 6 noticed more changes in themselves
   and their perception of the world as a result of medical training than
   students in Year 1. However, the proportion of positive changes to
   negative ones was 5.4:1 for Year 1 and 1.4:1 for Year 6 students.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that medical training constitutes a
   strong socializing experience, which has positive and negative impacts.
   Negative changes perceived by students include an increase in distrust
   and cynicism, whereas positive changes consist of enhanced maturity,
   self-confidence, and empathy, which are likely to have an impact on
   future doctors' professional practice.}},

Abstract = {{To address the country's most pressing healthcare needs, medical
   students must choose careers in primary care and commit to working with
   underserved populations. Involvement in student service organizations
   has been shown to strengthen leadership, empathy, and commitment to
   underserved health and may lead students to pursue careers in primary
   care. Description: In 2010, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of
   Medicine developed a novel 1-year longitudinal service-learning elective
   called SERVE (Service, Education, Reflection, Volunteerism Elective).
   Students earned elective credit for completing three course
   requirements: 10 service sessions, monthly reflections, and a
   service-learning project. Evaluation: One third of the class enrolled in
   the course (33/99), 25 students completed the course, and 20 completed
   the final evaluation. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the
   final evaluations demonstrated high satisfaction with the course, and
   appreciation of the opportunity to volunteer, teach, and develop service
   projects. SERVE students reported a strong commitment to continuing
   community service after graduation, with 100\% planning to continue
   volunteering and 70\% strongly agreeing with the statement that they
   would practice in an underserved community in the future. This
   commitment was higher than that expressed by the graduating class of
   2012 (34\%) and higher compared to a national average (30.9\%).
   Conclusions: SERVE is a unique 1-year course that reengages 4th-year
   medical students in service to their communities in a structured
   educational environment. SERVE students report that the course has
   increased their involvement in the community, supported their growth
   into a teaching role, and enhanced continuity within student-run free
   clinics. Future directions include assessing the impact of SERVE
   students on the experience of preclinical medical students in
   student-run free clinics; community response to SERVE projects; and the
   impact of SERVE on volunteerism, primary care specialty choice, and
   future practice in underserved communities for class participants during
   their medical careers.}},

Abstract = {{George Engel's biopsychosocial vision was simultaneously scientific and
   humanistic. He passionately presented an approach to clinical care to
   correct the progressive distancing of clinical care and research from
   the lived experience of the patient. Yet, while science provides ever
   greater evidence for the linkages between subjectively-reported
   experience and health outcomes, trainees and practicing clinicians
   struggle to realize a biopsychosocial vision in a pragmatic way. These
   challenges are magnified by the mandate for greater patient autonomy and
   participation in care, increased access to information, and overlaps and
   omissions as multiple professionals try to address the whole person.
   Importantly, trainees and clinicians get stuck implementing the
   biopsychosocial model partly because they have not developed the
   capacity for resilience, self-awareness, and self-monitoring. These
   capacities must accompany efforts to help clinicians engage more deeply
   with their patients; otherwise, they risk emotional distress, empathic
   failure, premature closure, and withdrawal from effective connections
   with patients. This article will explore ways in which Engel's
   biopsychosocial vision can be realized through building the capacities
   of clinicians to become more self-aware and resilient, and engage in
   compassionate action.}},

   on medical or veterinary undergraduate to clinical-or residency-level
   students. We selected studies for which the study population was
   randomized to the Web-based learning (WBL) intervention with a post-test
   comparison with another WBL or non-WBL method and that reported at least
   one empirical outcome. Two independent reviewers completed relevancy
   screening, data extraction, and synthesis of results using Kirkpatrick
   and Kirkpatrick's1 framework. The search retrieved 1,583 articles, and
   10 met the final inclusion criteria. We identified no published articles
   on Web-based communication platforms in veterinary medicine; however,
   publications summarized from human medicine demonstrated that WBL
   provides a potentially reliable and valid approach for teaching and
   assessing communication skills. Student feedback on the use of virtual
   patients for teaching clinical communication skills has been positive,
   though evidence has suggested that practice with virtual patients
   prompted lower relation-building responses. Empirical outcomes indicate

Abstract = {{Purpose: To illuminate patients' lived experiences of going through the
   process of being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD).
   Patients and methods: A phenomenological-hermeneutic analysis was
   applied in the interpretation of interviews with eight persons diagnosed
   with mild or moderate COPD.
   Results: One main theme `living in negotiation', and three themes
   `living with a body out of step with the diagnosis', `dealing with the
   past', and ` being challenged by the future' reflected the process
   participants were living through in their quest for acceptance and a new
   balance in life. Participants found that the diagnostic processes were
   confusing, and that the diagnosis itself was ` a slap in the face'.
   Unclear messages gave rise to fluctuating between an understanding of
   the condition as ` not too severe', insecurity, and fear. Shame and
   guilt related to the diagnosis had origins in the past, and in
   combination with the idea of `chronic' the COPD diagnosis interfered
   with the present moment and gave rise to uncertainty for the future. The
   understanding of the present is related to negotiations not only with
   the past, but also with the future. Thus temporal aspects of the
   diagnosis are of great significance for the process of finding
   acceptance.
   Conclusion: Regardless of disease severity, the diagnosis seems to be a
   breakdown of life, which puts life itself at stake. Medical
   professionals should be aware that the way the diagnosis is disclosed
   and communicated has considerable significance for how individuals
   understand and deal with their illness. The diagnosis should be
   communicated face-to-face, clearly and with empathy, and followed by
   information about COPD. Physicians should allow time and listen to the
   patients' stories, and thus develop a shared understanding of the
   temporal aspect of the illness and patients' needs and concerns. Thus,
   good communication is essential in determining whether the patient
   remains in negotiation, or enters a process toward acceptance and new
   understanding.}},

Title = {{Burnout among physicians}},
Journal = {{LIBYAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Burnout is a common syndrome seen in healthcare workers, particularly
   physicians who are exposed to a high level of stress at work; it
   includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal
   accomplishment. Burnout among physicians has garnered significant
   attention because of the negative impact it renders on patient care and
   medical personnel. Physicians who had high burnout levels reportedly
   committed more medical errors. Stress management programs that range
   from relaxation to cognitive-behavioral and patient-centered therapy
   have been found to be of utmost significance when it comes to preventing
   and treating burnout. However, evidence is insufficient to support that
   stress management programs can help reducing job-related stress beyond
   the intervention period, and similarly mindfulness-based stress
   reduction interventions efficiently reduce psychological distress and
   negative vibes, and encourage empathy while significantly enhancing
   physicians' quality of life. On the other hand, a few small studies have
   suggested that Balint sessions can have a promising positive effect in
   preventing burnout; moreover exercises can reduce anxiety levels and
   exhaustion symptoms while improving the mental and physical well-being
   of healthcare workers. Occupational interventions in the work settings
   can also improve the emotional and work-induced exhaustion. Combining
   both individual and organizational interventions can have a good impact
   in reducing burnout scores among physicians; therefore,
   multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the work environmental
   factors along with stress management programs that teach people how to
   cope better with stressful events showed promising solutions to manage
   burnout. However, until now there have been no rigorous studies to prove
   this. More interventional research targeting medical students,
   residents, and practicing physicians are needed in order to improve
   psychological well-being, professional careers, as well as the quality
   of care provided to patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Graduate medical education about Tourette Syndrome does not
   typically focus on understanding the perspectives and perceptions of
   individuals with the condition. Purposes: Explore the impact of
   patient-centered, patient-led education programs on participant
   knowledge and empathy for patients. Methods: Seventy-nine medical
   residents and students at five training sites in New Jersey attended
   patient-led presentations. Results were obtained using a
   pretest-posttest design assessing physician empathy, using the 10
   perspective-taking items from the Jefferson Scale of Empathy. Additional
   understanding of residents' experience was obtained by analyzing
   participant generated reaction statements. Results: A factorial ANOVA
   (pretest, Posttest x Gender x Specialty) revealed a significant increase
   (p < .05) from total pre-presentation scores to total post-presentation
   scores indicating that participants endorsed a more empathic view
   following the patient-led presentation. Participant statements revealed
   themes concordant with the practice of patient-centered medicine.
   Conclusions: Providing patient-led educational presentations to medical
   residents can increase physician empathy, increase knowledge of Tourette

Journal = {{ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Study objective: We sought to characterize and understand the residents'
   perspective on how professionalism develops through pediatric emergency
   medicine experiences.
   Methods: Qualitative methods (freelisting-listing words associated with
   professionalism and semistructured interviews) were conducted with
   senior emergency medicine and pediatric residents about their
   experiences rotating in the emergency department of a large, urban,
   tertiary care, freestanding children's hospital. All senior residents
   were eligible, with purposive sampling to maximize demographic
   variability. Saliency (importance) of words was analyzed with Smith S
   scores and consensus analysis. Interviews were conducted until content
   saturation was achieved; transcripts were coded by independent
   investigators to reach thematic consensus.
   Results: Twenty-five interviews (36\% emergency, 64\% pediatrics) were
   conducted. Common words associated with professionalism were
   ``respect,{''} ``compassion,{''} ``empathy,{''} and ``integrity{''};
   however, residents did not share a common consensus. The framework for
   how residents described the development of their professionalism
   includes observations, interactions, and environment. Examples include
   resident observation of role models; interactions with patients,
   families, and coworkers; self-reflection; and the unique environment of
   the ED. Residents believed that role modeling was the most influential
   factor. Few reported receiving sufficient observation by attending
   physicians during their interactions with patients and most reported
   receiving little direct feedback on their professionalism. Residents'
   descriptions of professionalism crossed multiple Accreditation Council
   for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies.
   Conclusion: Residents displayed high variability in their understanding
   of professionalism, which was frequently at variance with the
   corresponding ACGME competency definition. The resident perspective and
   understanding of professionalism may usefully inform refinements in
   ACGME milestones and entrustable professional activities.}},

Title = {{Medical Student Perceptions of Medical School Education About Suffering:
   A Multicenter Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{FAMILY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-44}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about what students perceive
   they are taught about suffering in medical school. We sought to explore
   medical student perceptions of their medical school education about
   suffering.
   METHODS: We used an online survey of medical students enrolled in four
   US medical schools with chi-square analysis of responses by gender and
   pre-clinical/clinical status.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,043 students (38\%) responded and indicated that
   teaching about suffering is occurring in the schools surveyed.
   Respondents most strongly endorsed statements that their medical school
   education explicitly teaches that the relief of suffering is an inherent
   function of being a physician (46.5\%) and that most of what they
   learned about dealing with suffering patients is taught by modeling
   (46.6\%). They reported that their education explicitly teaches about
   suffering (32.8\%), provides a good understanding of suffering (31.7\%),
   and teaches how to interact with suffering patients (31.7\%). Students
   gave the least support to statements that their education prepares them
   to personally deal with their reactions to the suffering of patients
   (25.1\%) and teaches how to diagnose suffering (15.3\%). Responses
   varied markedly according to gender and clinical status at two of the
   four schools surveyed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Teaching about suffering is occurring in the schools
   surveyed and can be variably experienced according to gender and
   clinical status. Implied curricular gaps include teaching about how to
   diagnose suffering and how to personally deal with the feelings that
   arise when caring for suffering patients. Further research on how
   students are learning about suffering is warranted to guide curriculum
   development and implementation.}},

Title = {{Stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS by healthcare workers at a
   tertiary hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a cross-sectional
   descriptive study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL ETHICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The issue of stigma is very important in the battle against
   HIV/AIDS in Africa since it may affect patient attendance at healthcare
   centres for obtaining antiretroviral (ARV) medications and regular
   medical checkups. Stigmatization creates an unnecessary culture of
   secrecy and silence based on ignorance and fear of victimization. This
   study was designed to determine if there is external stigmatization of
   people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) by health care workers (HCWs) at
   a tertiary hospital in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. The
   study investigated the impact of knowledge of HIV/AIDS by HCWs on
   treatment of patients, as well as the comfort level and attitude of HCWs
   when rendering care to PLWHA.
   Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was designed to collect
   data using an anonymous self-administered structured questionnaire from
   334 HCWs. The study was conducted in clinical departments of a large
   multidisciplinary 922-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Durban,
   KZN.
   Results: Overall HCWs had an above average knowledge about HIV/AIDS
   although some gaps in knowledge were identified. Tests of statistical
   significance showed that there was association between level of
   education and knowledge of HIV/AIDs (p <= 0.001); occupation and
   knowledge of HIV/AIDS (p <= 0.001); and gender and knowledge of HIV/AIDS
   (p = 0.004). Test for comfort level was only significant for gender,
   with males showing more comfort and empathy when dealing with PLWHA (p =
   0.003). The study also revealed that patients were sometimes tested for
   HIV without informed consent before surgery, due to fear of being
   infected, and there was some gossiping about patients' HIV status by
   HCWs, thereby compromising patient confidentiality. The majority of HCWs
   showed a willingness to report incidents of stigmatization and
   discrimination to higher authorities, for better monitoring and control.
   Conclusions: Although knowledge, attitude and comfort level of HCWs
   taking care of PLWHA was above average, enforcement of existing
   antidiscrimination laws and continuing education in medical ethics and
   healthcare law, would greatly improve the performance of HCWs taking
   care of PLWHAs. More psychological support and counselling should be
   provided to HCWs, to further reduce the impact of stigmatization and
   discrimination against PLWHA.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is central to a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. Valid
   and reliable Chinese instruments to assess nursing students' empathy are
   lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric
   properties of a Chinese version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Health
   Profession Students (C-JSE-HPS) among Taiwanese undergraduate nursing
   students. A convenience sample of 613 Taiwanese nursing students
   participated in the study. Content validity, construct validity,
   internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability were
   examined. Content validity was confirmed by a content validity index of
   0.89. Factor analysis yielded three components of perspective taking,
   compassionate care and standing in the patient's shoes, explaining
   57.14\% of total variance. Women scored higher on empathy than men.
   Also, students who were enrolled in the 4-year Bachelor of Science in
   Nursing (BSN) indicated greater empathy degrees than those in the 2-year
   Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN-to-BSN).
   Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the test-retest reliability were 0.93
   and 0.92 respectively. A C-JSE-HPS demonstrated satisfactory
   psychometric properties to measure empathy of undergraduate nursing
   students. Educators may use this instrument to assess empathic qualities
   among students and design effective empathy-oriented nursing curricula
   to improve the quality of nursing care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Depression is one of the most frequent mental disorders
   in older people, known to increase rates of disability and mortality.
   Depression in late life, commonly accompanied by multiple medical
   illnesses, reduces quality of life and is a strong risk factor for
   suicide. Despite its clinical significance, depression remains
   underdiagnosed and inadequately treated in older. patients.
   Cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies have the most empirical support in
   treating late-life depression, and are recommended by numerous
   guidelines in this indication. Group interventions are also recommended
   for older adults because they offer peer support, mitigate social
   isolation, encourage shared empathy and provide a context for peer
   feedback help from the group. Previous studies have shown that
   maladaptive schemas have an important role in the development or
   maintenance of depression and anxiety in older people, either as risk
   factors or as vulnerability markers, but there are no studies that have
   examined the effectiveness of schema-focused therapy to improve
   depression in late life.
   Objectives. - The main goals of the present study were to explore the
   relationship of maladaptive schemas with depression and anxiety severity
   in aged inpatients, and to evaluate the efficacy of a
   cognitive-behavioural individual and group treatment program that
   includes schema-focused therapy on depression, anxiety, and cognitive
   schemas activation.
   Methods. - The sample consisted of aged depressed inpatients (n=51)
   treated in a psychiatric unit. Participants completed measures of
   depression (Geriatric Depression Scale {[}GDS]) and anxiety (State-Trait
   Anxiety Inventory {[}STAID severity and maladaptive schemas (Cognitive
   Inventory of Subjective Distress {[}CISD]) at pre- and post-intervention
   (mean hospital stay: 4 weeks).
   Results. - The maladaptive schemas Loss of Individuality, Refusal of
   Assistance and Vulnerability are more activated in our sample of
   depressed subjects with regard to the reference population. Most of
   specific maladaptive schemas (except Fear of Losing Control) were
   significantly correlated to depression and anxiety-state severity. The
   GDS and the STAI scores, and the activation of five of seven maladaptive
   schemas measured by the CISD decreased significantly after treatment.
   Discussion. - This study confirms the results of previous research and
   shows that specific maladaptive schemas are related to depression and
   anxiety severity in clinically depressed aged patients. Contrary to
   other previous studies, we find that the activation of maladaptive
   schemas can decrease during a group psychotherapeutic program that
   includes schema-focused therapy. These findings support the feasibility
   of individual and group schema-focused therapy to assist older people
   suffering from depression effectively. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2013.}},
