Title = {{Identifying potential engaging leaders within medical education: The
   role of positive influence on peers}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{677-683}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous research has paid little to no attention towards
   exploring methods of identifying existing medical student leaders.
   Aim: Focusing on the role of influence and employing the tenets of the
   engaging leadership model, this study examines demographic and academic
   performance-related differences of positive influencers and if students
   who have been peer-identified as positive influencers also demonstrate
   high levels of genuine concern for others.
   Methods: Three separate fourth-year classes were asked to designate
   classmates that had significant positive influences on their
   professional and personal development. The top 10\% of those students
   receiving positive influence nominations were compared with the other
   students on demographics, academic performance, and genuine concern for
   others.
   Results: Besides age, no demographic differences were found between
   positive influencers and other students. High positive influencers were
   not found to have higher standardized exam scores but did receive
   significantly higher clinical clerkship ratings. High positive
   influencers were found to possess a higher degree of genuine concern for
   others.
   Conclusion: The findings lend support to (a) utilizing the engaging
   model to explore leaders and leadership within medical education, (b)
   this particular method of identifying existing medical student leaders,
   and (c) return the focus of leadership research to the power of
   influence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Patient-centered approaches have a positive impact on
   adherence to treatment, self-management of chronic disease, and patient
   satisfaction. We seek to graduate physicians who provide effective
   Patient-Centered Care (PCC). The aims of this research were to (a)
   include the patients' perspectives in describing behaviors essential to
   effective PCC, (b) create an authentic, credible tool to assess these
   behaviors in third-year medical students, and (c) validate the
   assessment tool through the eyes of our patients.
   Methods: To develop and validate PCC behaviors we (a) developed PCC
   descriptors that included patient perspectives, (b) developed scenarios
   for students to demonstrate PCC, (c) administered the PCC-Objective
   Structured Clinical Exam, and (d) used the patient perspective to
   validate results.
   Results: Faculty and students found the PCC-OSCE to be an authentic
   experience. Students received abundant individualized feedback and
   demonstrated strong performance in communicating effectively, avoiding
   medical jargon, listening actively, demonstrating empathy, and leading
   critical conversations. Patient critiques of exemplary performances
   confirmed that the PCC-OSCE assesses elements the patients viewed as
   essential to PCC.
   Conclusion: Incorporating the patients' perspective aids in better
   understanding professional competencies and legitimizes the assessment.}},

Title = {{Overlap between empathy, teamwork and integrative approach to patient

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{755-758}},
Abstract = {{Background: Empathy, teamwork and an integrative approach to patient
   care share common denominators such as interpersonal skills and
   understanding patients' concerns. Thus, a significant overlap among
   measures of empathy, teamwork and integrative approach to patient care
   is expected.
   Aim: This study examined the magnitude of overlap (shared variance)
   among three measures of empathy, teamwork and an integrative approach to
   patient care.
   Methods: Three-hundred seventy-three medical students completed the
   Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE), the Jefferson Scale of Attitudes
   toward Physician-Nurse Collaboration (JSAPNC) and Integrative Patient
   Care (IPC).
   Results: Significant overlaps were found among the three measures (p <
   0.01), ranging from 13\% (r = 0.36), between JSAPNC and IPC, to 18\% (r
   = 0.42), between JSE and JSAPNC, and 30\% (r = 0.55) between JSE and IPC
   for the total sample. Pattern of findings was similar for men and women.
   In a multiple regression model, a significant multiple correlation (R =
   0.60, p < 0.01) was obtained in correlating scores on the JSE with the
   JSAPNC, and IPC scores, controlling for gender effect (men = 0 and women
   = 1).
   Conclusions: The significant links between empathy, teamwork and IPC
   support the common denominator assumption. The findings that IPC shares
   common variance with empathy and teamwork have implications for medical
   education curriculum, suggesting that implementation of integrative
   patient care can improve empathic engagement in patient care and
   orientation toward teamwork.}},

Title = {{Reconsidering the ``decline'' of medical student empathy as reported in
   studies using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student version
   (JSPE-S)}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{783-786}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The suggestion that empathy ``declines'' or ``erodes'' as
   students progress through medical school has largely rested on
   observations reported from Jefferson Medical College in the United
   States using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) developed
   by Hojat and colleagues. Now that the student version of JSPE has been
   administered to medical students in more than a dozen countries, it is
   timely to consider whether or not the Jefferson ``case study'' and the
   conclusions drawn from it are generalisable.
   Methods: A literature research was conducted on MEDLINE in mid-2014 to
   identify studies reporting administrations of the Student version of
   JPSE (JSPE-S) to cohorts of medical students and the means for studies
   and their sub-parts conducted in Japan, South Korea, China, Kuwait,
   India, Iran, UK, USA, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican
   Republic and Portugal.
   Results: The means of these studies from a dozen countries outside the
   USA consistently cluster round 75\% out of the possible maximum of 140
   unlike the early Jefferson studies (although the later Jefferson means
   are also <120).
   Conclusions: These observations may support Costa et al.'s contention
   that ``a latent growth model suggests that empathy of medical students
   does not decline over time'' (p. 509) - or at least not significantly.
   But in order to understand the maturation process of medical students
   and trainees we need to develop more sophisticated, integrated models
   that combine culturally-sensitive concepts of emotional intelligence and
   moral reasoning with far more refined understandings of the nature of
   empathy required for the safe practice of patient-centred medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Active surveillance (AS) represents an expectant treatment

   represent a strategy to reduce the burden of overtreatment rooted in
   intensified PSA testing. Facing the imprecision of risk stratification

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was designed to provide typical descriptive
   statistics, score distributions and percentile ranks of the Jefferson
   Scale of Empathy-Medical Student version (JSE-S) of male and female
   medical school matriculants to serve as proxy norm data and tentative

   students (1,336 women and 1,301 men) who matriculated at Sidney Kimmel
   (formerly Jefferson) Medical College between 2002 and 2012, and
   completed the JSE at the beginning of medical school. Information
   extracted from descriptive statistics, score distributions and
   percentile ranks for male and female matriculants were used to develop
   proxy norm data and tentative cutoff scores. Results: The score
   distributions of the JSE tended to be moderately skewed and platykurtic.
   Women obtained a significantly higher mean score (116.2 +/- 9.7) than
   men (112.3 +/- 10.8) on the JSE-S (t(2,635) = 9.9, p < 0.01). It was
   suggested that percentile ranks can be used as proxy norm data. The
   tentative cutoff score to identify low scorers was <= 95 for men and <=

   scores for admission decisions under certain conditions and for
   identifying students in need of enhancing their empathy. (C) 2015 S.

Pages = {{117-123}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinical practicum provides many opportunities for nursing
   students to learn more about their subject and develop essential nursing
   skills. In contrast, nursing students often have difficulties during
   their clinical practicum.
   Aim: This study aims to describe the clinical experiences of
   undergraduate nursing students in the intensive care unit.
   Methods: A descriptive qualitative approach was used in this study. The
   study was performed at a military medical academy between 1 March and 30
   April 2008. The study was conducted with 15 fourth-year baccalaureate
   nursing students. Data were obtained through open-ended and in-depth
   audio-taped interviews, which lasted approximately 35-45 min.
   Findings: Themes emerged from the participants' descriptions of their
   experiences in the intensive care unit: anxiety, fear of doing harm,
   emotional connection and empathy, improving self-confidence, perceived
   responsibility for patients, prioritizing care of patients, preserving
   dignity, coping with confronting situations, and communication in the
   intensive care unit.
   Conclusion: The views and expectations of nursing students regarding
   intensive care practice are important for the organization of the
   nursing education environment. The nursing curriculum must be revised
   and developed according to the needs of students. (C) 2013 Australian

Abstract = {{At present, fostering and promoting empathy, an important humanistic
   quality, are believed ethical imperatives, and should be carried through
   the pharmacy education to facilitate the interpersonal and philosophical
   development of healthcare students. A cross-sectional study used the
   JSE-HPS (Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Health Profession Student version)
   to assess 263 Chinese pharmacy undergraduates from 1st to 4th year at
   Wuhan University of Science and Technology. Attached to the scale was a
   survey containing questions on demographics and favorite implementation
   model of humanistic education. Mean score of JSE-HPS was 112.58.
   Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.81. Three factors emerging in the
   factor analysis of JSE-HPS are ``perspective taking{''}, ``compassionate
   care{''} and ``ability to stand in patients' shoes{''}. And empathy
   score of 4th-year students was highest. In addition, the three most
   popular implementation models were ``Social activities{''},
   ``Extracurricular activity on pharmacy humanistic education{''}, and
   ``Humanistic education should be infiltrated and integrated within the
   existing professional curriculum{''}, respectively. Our study findings
   indicate that humanistic education in the foundations courses for 1st to
   3rd academic year pharmacy students need to be focus on. For successful
   practice, humanistic education that promotes empathy has to be
   integrated within the existing training programs for pharmacy
   undergraduate students in a vivid way.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The effectiveness of fertility treatments is influenced by
   the health care professionals' knowledge regarding infertility as well
   as their empathy. Aim: The aim of the study was to examine
   infertility-related knowledge and perceptions of emotional and mind/body
   consequences of infertility among medical students. Methods: A
   questionnaire design was used. Data were obtained from 112 medical
   university students (76 women, 36 men) who participated involuntary and
   compensation-free. Results: Medical students' knowledge concerning
   infertility proved to be incomplete and ambiguous. Subjects
   underestimated the presence of mind/body and emotional symptoms caused
   by infertility in men particularly, and overestimated some emotional
   concerns in women, e. g. sadness. Conclusions: Medical students have
   gaps in their subject-specific knowledge, so that they need more (even
   practical) information regarding infertility during their studies.
   Students' conceptions about emotional and physical consequences of
   infertility are distorted by stereotypes. The risk of these biases is
   that it could make it difficult to perceive patients in a non-distorted
   way, especially infertile male patients.}},

Title = {{Factors Associated With Family Satisfaction With End-of-Life Care in the
   ICU}},
Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{82-93}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Family satisfaction with end-of-life care in the ICU has not
   previously been systematically reviewed. Our objective was to perform a
   review, synthesizing published data identifying factors associated with
   family satisfaction with end-of-life care in critically ill adult
   populations.
   METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE
   (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), MEDLINE
   Updated, EMBASE (Excerpta Medical Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to
   Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycInfo, and PubMed. Two authors
   reviewed retrieved titles and abstracts. Studies describing nonadult and
   non-ICU populations or not addressing end-of-life care, family
   satisfaction, or factors affecting satisfaction were excluded. The
   remaining articles underwent full review and data extraction by two
   authors. Quality was assessed using a checklist based on the
   recommendations of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials
   group.
   RESULTS: The search yielded 1,072 articles, with 23 articles describing
   14 studies meeting inclusion criteria. All studies obtained satisfaction
   data from family members via surveys and structured interviews. Specific
   communication strategies increasing satisfaction included: expressions
   of empathy, nonabandonment, and assurances of comfort and provision of
   written information. Additionally, support for shared decision-making,
   family presence at time of death, and specific patient-care measures
   such as extubation before death were associated with increased
   satisfaction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Good-quality communication, support for shared
   decision-making, and specific patient-care measures were associated with
   increased satisfaction with end-of-life care. Assessing the family's
   desire to participate in shared decision-making may also be an important
   factor. Few interventions increased satisfaction. Future research is
   needed to further define optimal communication strategies, understand
   effective integration of palliative care into the ICU, and define
   significant score changes in survey instruments.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{105-111}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine, primarily, the effects of ethnicity and gender, which could
   introduce bias into scoring, on standardized patient (SP) assessments of
   medical students and, secondarily, to examine medical students'
   self-reported empathy for ethnicity and gender effects so as to compare
   self-perception with the perceptions of SPs.
   Method
   Participants were 577 students from four medical schools in 2012: 373
   (65\%) were white, 79 (14\%) black/African American, and 125 (22\%)
   Asian/Pacific Islander. These students were assessed by 84 SPs: 62
   (74\%) were white and 22 (26\%) were black/African American. SPs
   completed the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician
   Empathy (JSPPPE) and the Global Ratings of Empathy tool. Students
   completed the Jefferson Scale of Empathy and two Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index subscales. The investigators used 2,882 student-SP
   encounters in their analyses.
   Results
   Analyses of SPs' assessments of students' empathy indicated significant
   interaction effects of gender and ethnicity. Female students, regardless
   of ethnicity, obtained significantly higher mean JSPPPE scores than men.
   Female black/African American, female white, and female Asian/Pacific
   Islander students scored significantly higher on the JSPPPE than their
   respective male counterparts. Male black/African American students
   obtained the lowest SP assessment scores of empathy regardless of SP
   ethnicity. Black/African American students obtained the highest mean
   scores on self-reported empathy.
   Conclusions
   The significant interaction effects of ethnicity and gender in clinical
   encounters, plus the inconsistencies observed between SPs' assessments
   of students' empathy and students' self-reported empathy, raise
   questions about possible ethnicity and gender biases in the SPs'
   assessments of medical students' clinical skills.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The steady increase in the number of people living and dying
   with dementia, coupled with the recent focus on quality of care, has
   highlighted the importance of dementia training for health care
   professionals. This exploratory study aimed to discover which skills
   health care students felt were important in providing quality
   end-of-life care to dementia patients.
   Methods: Ninety-four medicine, nursing, and pharmacy students
   participated in a larger study using open-ended and closed questions to
   explore attitudes related to caring for dementia patients at the end of
   life. This study looks at the student responses to an open-ended
   question regarding the skills and knowledge they believe are needed to
   provide end-of-life care to dementia patients. Individual responses were
   reviewed by the researchers, coded into key issues, and tabulated for
   frequency of occurrences and group differences.
   Results: Several common issues emerged: knowledge, patience, empathy,
   understanding, family involvement, compassion, medication knowledge,
   respect/patient autonomy, communication, quality of life, and patient
   education. Significant differences were observed among the participant
   groups on the following issues: Patience and understanding (pharmacy
   students mentioned these issues less frequently than medical and nursing
   students), compassion (medical students mentioned this issue more
   frequently than pharmacy students), and medication knowledge (pharmacy
   students mentioned this issue more frequently than medical and nursing
   students).
   Conclusions: Different health care disciplines (in-training) value
   different skill sets for the provision of dementia care at the
   end-of-life. As health care education for dementia patients at the end
   of life is expanded, it will be important to understand which skills
   both patients and health care students value.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of studies on doctor patient
   communication skills training (CST) for medical students and physicians
   in mainland China.
   Methods: We retrieved articles from six electronic databases, and
   searched additional eligible papers by checking reference lists. Chinese
   or English-language studies focused on CST and implemented in mainland
   China were applied to the pre-determined criteria. Articles included
   were further reviewed under the following categories: participant;
   training strategy; assessment; and outcome.
   Results: 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. 90\% of the CST improved
   trainees' communication skills using a strategy which included a
   didactic component combined with practical rehearsal and feedback. The
   duration of training varied substantially. A lack of enhancement in
   empathy, and the use of open-ended questions were reported. 83\% of the
   assessment instruments were self-designed and most lacked reliability
   and validity testing. Only two of the included studies evaluated patient
   satisfaction.
   Conclusions: The majority of included studies attained statistically
   significant improvements. Chinese doctors and medical students'
   communication skills can be enhanced through CST.
   Practice implications: Future studies in China should place stronger
   emphasis on the development of training strategies, validation of the
   assessment instruments, and evaluation of patient satisfaction affected
   by CST. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Communication skills can be trained alongside clinical
   reasoning, history taking or clinical examination skills. This is
   advocated as a solution to the low transfer of communication skills.
   Still, students have to integrate the knowledge/skills acquired during
   different curriculum parts in patient consultations at some point. How
   do medical students experience these integrated consultations within a
   simulated environment and in real practice when dealing with
   responsibility?
   Methods: Six focus groups were conducted with (pre-)/clerkship students.
   Results: Students were motivated to practice integrated consultations
   with simulated patients and felt like `real physicians'. However, their
   focus on medical problem solving drew attention away from improving
   their communication skills. Responsibility for real patients triggered
   students' identity development. This identity formation guided the
   development of an own consultation style, a process that was hampered by
   conflicting demands of role models.
   Conclusion: Practicing complete consultations results in the dilemma of
   prioritizing medical problem solving above attention for patient
   communication. Integrated consultation training advances this dilemma to
   the pre-clerkship period. During clerkships this dilemma is heightened
   because real patients trigger empathy and responsibility, which invites
   students to define their role as doctor. Practice implications: When
   training integrated consultations, educators should pay attention to
   students' learning priorities and support the development of students'
   professional identity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Patient safety skills in primary care: a national survey of GP educators}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinicians have a vital role in promoting patient safety
   that goes beyond their technical competence. The qualities and
   attributes of the safe hospital doctor have been explored but similar
   work within primary care is lacking. Exploring the skills and attributes
   of a safe GP may help to inform the development of training programmes
   to promote patient safety within primary care.
   This study aimed to determine the views of General Practice Educational
   Supervisors (GPES) regarding the qualities and attributes of a safe
   General Practitioner (GP) and the perceived trainability of these safety
   skills and to compare selected results with those generated by a
   previous study of hospital doctors.
   Methods: This was a two-stage study comprising content validation of a
   safety skills questionnaire (originally developed for hospital doctors)
   (Stage 1) and a prospective survey of all GPES in Scotland (n = 691)
   (Stage 2).
   Results: Stage 1: The content-validated questionnaire comprised 66
   safety skills/attributes across 17 broad categories with an overall
   content validation index of 0.92. Stage 2: 348 (50\%) GPES completed the
   survey. GPES felt the skills/attributes most important to being a safe
   GP were honesty (93\%), technical clinical skills (89\%) and
   conscientiousness (89\%). That deemed least important/ relevant to being
   a safe GP was leadership (36\%). This contrasts sharply with the views
   of hospital doctors in the previous study. GPES felt the most trainable
   safety skills/attributes were technical skills (93\%), situation
   awareness (75\%) and anticipation/preparedness (71\%). The least
   trainable were honesty (35\%), humility (33\%) and patient
   awareness/empathy (30\%). Additional safety skills identified as
   relevant to primary care included patient advocacy, negotiation skills,
   accountability/ownership and clinical intuition (? listening to that
   worrying little inner voice?).
   Conclusions: GPES believe a broad range of skills and attributes
   contribute to being a safe GP. Important but subtle differences exist
   between what primary care and secondary care doctors perceive as core
   safety attributes. Educationalists, GPs and patient safety experts
   should collaborate to develop and implement training in these skills to
   ensure that current and future GPs possess the necessary competencies to
   engage and lead in safety improvement efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Person-oriented medicine is characterized by a holistic approach in
   patient management that embraces physical, psychological, social and
   spiritual aspects of health and disease. It responds to the needs of
   patients and health care workers to form an effective therapeutic
   relationship based on trust, empathy, compassion and responsiveness to
   the individual needs of a patient. Person-oriented perspectives in
   neurology include active collaborative partnership between a physician
   and a patient, and intuitive perception, which has a neurobiological
   correlate in the human mirror neuron system, thus expressing a
   considerable impact on the quality of the physician's diagnostic and
   therapeutic activities. On the other hand, personalized approach in
   medicine implies integration of clinical information and personal
   genotyping. Personalized neurology provides gene-based preclinical
   prediction of disease with improved risk assessment, early detection of
   disease and targeted intervention. The combination of personalized
   approach and clinical information accelerates the translation of genetic
   discoveries into clinical practice, which ultimately results in improved
   health care system. Person-oriented perspectives contribute
   significantly to the growing pluralism of medical science and provide a
   greater humanization of medicine, individualized treatment and autonomy
   during therapeutic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale We believe that this study represents an innovative approach
   to clarifying the definitions of routine, empathic and compassionate
   health care, as well as of sympathy. We emphasize the importance of
   affective empathy and its intensification in the context of patient
   suffering (compassion), without abandoning the ideal of clinical
   equanimity.
   Methods We develop a pedagogical model for clinicians and trainees who
   are weaker in their empathic skills that includes four levels of growth.
   We clarify representative obstacles to empathic and compassionate care
   in education and clinical practice. We summarize the four beneficiaries
   of empathic and compassionate care (clinicians, patients, trainees,
   institutions). We suggest areas for future research, including the
   development of a compassion scale and conclude with a statement on how
   the conceptual and professional confusion we address adversely impacts
   patients and trainees. The article represents the consensus work of a
   group of health care professionals and students at Stony Brook
   University Hospital and School of Medicine who have been engaged in this
   project for several years through the Center for Medical Humanities,
   Compassionate Care, and Bioethics, established in August of 2008.
   Conclusions We discern a shift away from concepts of clinical empathy
   and compassionate care that deny a significant place for an affective
   component and that idealize `detachment'.}},

Abstract = {{Objective.-The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship
   between psychology and pregnancy loss.
   Methods.-A literature review was conducted by consulting Medline until
   April 2014.
   Results.-Psychological factors appear to be significantly associated
   with the risk of recurrent miscarriage. Depression and anxiety are
   common symptoms after miscarriage. A return to normal scores of
   depression and anxiety is frequently found in one year. A systematic
   psychological treatment after an episode of miscarriage seems to not
   bring obvious benefits, one year after a miscarriage, in terms of
   anxiety and depression. After a stillbirth, psychological impacts on the
   couple, such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, are common. An
   empathetic and respectful attitude of all medical and paramedical team
   at the support is associated with better psychological experience.
   Conclusion.-After a pregnancy loss, psychological consequences are
   common and usually reversible. An attitude of empathy is desirable in
   order to accompany patients and to consider a future pregnancy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{BackgroundDepressive symptoms have detrimental effects on quality of
   life and mortality. Poor adherence to a treatment regimen is a potential
   mechanism for the increased risk of adverse medical events associated
   with depression. Regarding oral anticoagulation with vitaminK
   antagonists, adherence is crucial for the outcome. Little is known about
   the clinical relevance of current depressiveness for anticoagulation
   treatment.
   ObjectivesTo examine the impact of current depressiveness on
   anticoagulation treatment in regular medical care.
   Patients/MethodsWe examined the association between clinically
   significant depressiveness as assessed by the Patient Health
   Questionnaire-22 (PHQ-22) with the percentage of time in the therapeutic
   range (TTR), self-rated compliance, several aspects of health literacy,
   anticoagulation side-effects and treatment satisfaction in a
   cross-sectional study of 1790 oral anticoagulation outpatients.
   ResultsSeven hundred and sixteen participants (40.0\%) had clinically
   significant depressive symptoms. Depressed persons reported lower
   compliance with intake of prescribed medication and regular visits for
   control of anticoagulation, more unspecific side-effects (e.g. pruritus)
   and lower satisfaction with the anticoagulation treatment and their
   doctors' expertise and empathy. Depressed as compared with non-depressed
   individuals had a lower TTR (-4.67; 95\% CI, -8.39 to -0.95). Increasing
   severity of depressiveness was related with decreasing TTR. However,
   depressiveness lost its significant impact on TTR after multivariable
   adjustment (-3.11; 95\% CI, -6.88 to 0.66).
   ConclusionsClinically significant depressiveness was highly prevalent
   and impaired several aspects of anticoagulation treatment.
   Depressiveness should be regarded as a clinically significant condition
   that needs to be addressed in the management of anticoagulation
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of apologising to patients harmed by adverse events has been a
   subject of interest and debate within medicine, politics, and the law
   since the early 1980s. Although apology serves several important social
   roles, including recognising the victims of harm, providing an
   opportunity for redress, and repairing relationships, compelled
   apologies ring hollow and ultimately undermine these goals. Apologies
   that stem from external authorities' edicts rather than an offender's
   own self-criticism and moral reflection are inauthentic and contribute
   to a ``moral flabbiness{''} that stunts the moral development of both
   individual providers and the medical profession. Following a discussion
   of a recent case from New Zealand in which a midwife was required to
   apologise not only to the parents but also to the baby, it is argued
   that rather than requiring health care providers to apologise,
   authorities should instead train, foster, and support the capacity of
   providers to apologise voluntarily.}},

Abstract = {{As the recent Ebola outbreak demonstrates, visibility is central to the
   shaping of political, medical, and socioeconomic decisions. The
   symposium in this issue of the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry explores
   the uneasy relationship between the necessity of making diseases
   visible, the mechanisms of legal and visual censorship, and the overall
   ethics of viewing and spectatorship, including the effects of media
   visibility on the perception of particular ``marked{''} bodies.
   Scholarship across the disciplines of communication, anthropology,
   gender studies, and visual studies, as well as a photographer's visual
   essay and memorial reflection, throw light on various strategies of
   visualization and (de)legitimation and link these to broader
   socioeconomic concerns. Questions of the ethics of spectatorship, such
   as how to evoke empathy in the representation of individuals' suffering
   without perpetuating social and economic inequalities, are explored in
   individual, (trans-)national, and global contexts, demonstrating how
   disease (in)visibility intersects with a complex nexus of health,
   sexuality, and global/national politics. A sensible management of
   visibility-an ``ecology of the visible{''}aEuro{''}can be productive of
   more viable ways of individual and collective engagement with those who
   suffer.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Published research has demonstrated that the multiple
   mini-interview (MMI) is a reliable assessment instrument in medical and
   nursing student selection. There is a dearth of evidence specifically
   relating to the advancement and subsequent evaluation of MMIs in the
   context of student midwife selection.
   Objectives: To develop, pilot and examine the reliability of MMIs in
   pre-registration student midwife selection in a UK setting.
   Design and setting: DeVellis' framework for questionnaire development
   underpinned the generation of MMI scenarios. BSc (Hons) Midwifery
   Studies students at a Higher Education Institution in the UK volunteered
   to participate in `mock' MMI circuits during the first week of their
   programme.
   Results: An eight station model was piloted. Communication skills were
   rated at each station as a generic attribute. Station specific
   attributes assessed included: compassion and empathy; respect for
   difference and diversity; honesty and integrity; intellectual curiosity
   and reflective nature; advocacy; respect for privacy and dignity; team
   working and initiative; the role of the midwife and motivation to become
   a midwife. Participants' responses to scenario questions were rated on a
   7 point scale. Cronbach's alpha scores measuring internal consistency
   ranged from 0.91 to 0.97
   Conclusion: The systematic development of the MMI model and scenarios
   resulted in `excellent' reliability across all stations. These findings
   endorse the MMI technique as a reliable alternative to the personal
   interview in informing final decisions in pre-registration student
   midwife selection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionTeacher's attitude domain, a pivotal aspect of clinical
   teaching, is missing in the Stanford Faculty Development Program
   Questionnaire (SFDPQ), the most widely used student-based assessment
   method of clinical teaching skills. This study was conducted to develop
   and validate the teacher's attitude domain and evaluate the validity and
   internal consistency reliability of the augmented SFDPQ.
   MethodsItems generated for the new domain included teacher's enthusiasm,
   sobriety, humility, thoroughness, empathy, and accessibility. The study
   involved 20 resident doctors assessed once by 64 medical students using
   the augmented SFDPQ. Construct validity was explored using correlation
   among the different domains and a global rating scale. Factor analysis
   was performed.
   ResultsThe response rate was 94\%. The new domain had a Cronbach's alpha
   of 0.89, with 1-factor solution explaining 57.1\% of its variance. It
   showed the strongest correlation to the global rating scale (rho= 0.71).
   The augmented SFDPQ, which had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.93, correlated
   better (rho= 0.72, p < 0.00001) to the global rating scale than the
   original SFDPQ (rho= 0.67, p < 0.00001).
   DiscussionThe new teacher's attitude domain exhibited good internal
   consistency and construct and factorial validity. It enhanced the
   content and construct validity of the SFDPQ. The validated construct of
   the augmented SFDPQ is recommended for design and evaluation of basic
   and continuing clinical teaching programs.}},

Title = {{Facial affect recognition and exit examination performance in medical
   students: a prospective exploratory study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Facial affect recognition (FAR) abilities underpin emotional
   intelligence (EI). The latter is suggested to predict academic success
   and to be important for clinician-patient interaction. It is therefore
   of interest to investigate the possible association between FAR and
   academic performance in undergraduate medical students.
   Methods: We assessed the association between the ability to recognize
   emotions through facial expression and exit examination performance, a
   measure of clinical proficiency, in undergraduate medical students
   stratified by gender at a South African tertiary institution using a
   prospective descriptive design. Data on the perception of facial
   expressions and exit examination marks were obtained from 144 (61\%)
   females and 93 (39\%) males with a mean age of 24.1 +/- 1.6 years.
   Facial affect recognition measures on the Hexagon and Animation tasks
   were individually correlated with academic performance indicators using
   Pearson correlation.
   Results: The perceptual discrimination of anger was associated with
   improved performance in anaesthetics (r = .24; p = .004) and urology (r
   =. 24; p = .001), while the recognition of happiness was associated with
   decreased performance in obstetrics (r = -.21, p = .002). Gender was an
   effect modifier in the relationship between perceptual discrimination of
   anger and urology performance (p = .03), with a strong positive
   relationship for males, but a non-significant relationship for females.
   Conclusion: There was no overall correlation between FAR and overall
   academic performance or with gender. However, subject (specialty)
   specific findings with recognition of specific emotions and with gender
   as effect modifier poses interesting questions about EI and FAR and
   prompts further research into FAR as a useful tool. Being an objective
   test and offering a more focused assessment makes FAR worthy of further
   application.}},

Title = {{Art-making in a family medicine clerkship: how does it affect medical
   student empathy?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: To provide patient-centred holistic care, doctors must
   possess good interpersonal and empathic skills. Medical schools
   traditionally adopt a skills-based approach to such training but
   creative engagement with the arts has also been effective. A novel
   arts-based approach may help medical students develop empathic
   understanding of patients and thus contribute to medical students'
   transformative process into compassionate doctors. This study aimed to
   evaluate the impact of an arts-making workshop on medical student
   empathy.
   Methods: This was a mixed-method quantitative-qualitative study. In the
   2011-12 academic year, all 161 third year medical students at the
   University of Hong Kong were randomly allocated into either an
   arts-making workshop or a problem-solving workshop during the Family
   Medicine clerkship according to a centrally-set timetable. Students in
   the arts-making workshop wrote a poem, created artwork and completed a
   reflective essay while students in the conventional workshop
   problem-solved clinical cases and wrote a case commentary. All students
   who agreed to participate in the study completed a measure of empathy
   for medical students, the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) (student
   version), at the start and end of the clerkship. Quantitative data
   analysis: Paired t-test and repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare
   the change within and between groups respectively. Qualitative data
   analysis: Two researchers independently chose representational
   narratives based on criteria adapted from art therapy. The final 20
   works were agreed upon by consensus and thematically analysed using a
   grounded theory approach.
   Results: The level of empathy declined in both groups over time, but
   with no statistically significant differences between groups. For JSE
   items relating to emotional influence on medical decision making,
   participants in the arts-making workshop changed more than those in the
   problem-solving workshop. From the qualitative data, students perceived
   benefits in arts-making, and gained understanding in relation to self,
   patients, pain and suffering, and the role of the doctor.
   Conclusions: Though quantitative findings showed little difference in
   empathy between groups, arts-making workshop participants gained
   empathic understanding in four different thematic areas. This workshop
   also seemed to promote greater self-awareness which may help medical
   students recognize the potential for emotions to sway judgment. Future
   art workshops should focus on emotional awareness and regulation.}},

Title = {{Psychological distress and academic self-perception among international
   medical students: the role of peer social support}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Psychological distress among medical students is commonly
   observed during medical education and is generally related to poor
   academic self-perception. We evaluated the role of peer social support
   at medical schools in the association between psychological distress and
   academic self-perception.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted in a medical degree program for
   138 international students educated in English in the Czech Republic.
   The Medical Student Well-Being Index was used to define the students'
   psychological distress. Perceived peer social support was investigated
   with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Poor
   academic self-perception was defined as the lowest 30\% of a subscale
   score of the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure. Analyses
   evaluated the presence of additive interactions between psychological
   distress and peer social support on poor academic self-perception,
   adjusted for possible confounders.
   Results: Both psychological distress and low peer social support were
   negatively associated with poor academic self-perception, adjusted for
   local language proficiency and social support from family. Students with
   psychological distress and low peer social support had an odds ratio of
   11.0 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-56.6) for poor academic
   self-perception as compared with those without distress who had high
   peer social support. The presence of an additive interaction was
   confirmed in that the joint association was four times as large as what
   would have been expected to be on summing the individual risks of
   psychological distress and low peer social support (synergy index = 4.5,
   95\% CI: 1.3-14.9).
   Conclusions: Psychological distress and low peer social support may
   synergistically increase the probability of poor academic
   self-perception among international medical students. Promoting peer
   social relationships at medical school may interrupt the vicious cycle
   of psychological distress and poor academic performance.}},

Title = {{Concerns voiced by patients and GPs' responses during psychosocial
   visits in primary care: a historical cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a recent study comparing psychosocial consultations prior
   to and after the implementation of national clinical guidelines in the
   Netherlands, we found that general practitioners (GPs) showed less
   empathy in the more recent consultations. As a consequence, patients
   possibly have less scope to express their worries. The objective is to
   investigate whether patients have become more reluctant to open up about
   their concerns during psychosocial consultations and how GPs respond.
   Methods: Consultations from previous study samples videotaped between
   1977 and 2008 and categorized by GPs as `completely psychosocial' were
   selected for the present study. These consultations were observed using
   the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES) to
   capture cues and concerns expressed by patients and GPs' immediate
   responses. We compared consultations prior to (N = 121) and after (N =
   391) introduction of national clinical guidelines in the 1990s.
   Results: In 92\% of the consultations, patients presented at least one
   worry. These were most often expressed implicitly. However, the
   proportion of consultations containing at least one explicit concern
   changed from 24\% to 37\% over time. The increased number of expressed
   cues and concerns was partly explained by a change in GP
   characteristics; the latter sample contained more female and more
   experienced GPs. Furthermore, cues and concerns were more often
   expressed during later phases of consultations in recent years.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that patients have become somewhat more
   explicit in expressing their worries. However, GPs need to be aware
   that, still, most worries are expressed implicitly and that new concerns
   may appear towards the end of consultations.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify existing challenges and potential strategies for
   providing complex care training to future pediatricians from a national
   group of educators.
   METHODS: Data were collected from pediatric educators involved in
   complex care at the Pediatric Educational Excellence Across the
   Continuum national meeting. Participants completed an anonymous 15-item
   survey adapted from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)
   Best Practices for Better Care initiative and participated in a focus
   group to understand the challenges and potential solutions to pediatric
   complex care education. Data were analyzed using grounded theory.
   RESULTS: Of the 15 participants, 9(60\%) were in educational leadership
   positions. All participants provided care to children with medical
   complexity (CMC), although 80\% (n = 12) reported no formal training.
   Thematic analysis revealed learners' challenges in 2 domains: 1) a lack
   of ownership for the patient because of decreased continuity,
   decision-making authority, and autonomy, as a result of the multitude of
   care providers and parents' distrust; and 2) a sense of being
   overwhelmed as a result of lack of preparedness and disruptions in work
   flow. Participants suggested 3 mitigating strategies: being candid about
   the difficulties of complex care, discussing the social mandate to care
   for CMC, and cultivating humility among learners.
   CONCLUSIONS: Residency education must prepare pediatricians to care for
   all children, regardless of disease. Training in complex care involves
   redefining the physician's role so that they are better equipped to
   participate in collaboration, empathy and advocacy with CMC. This study
   is the first to identify specific challenges and offer potential
   solutions to help establish training guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{AimWe investigated the associations between staff work characteristics,
   parents' experiences and a number of medical outcome measures.
   MethodsThis explorative multicentre study took place in the neonatal
   intensive care units (NICUs) of five German university hospitals between
   2009 and 2011. We assessed staff work characteristics by surveying 126
   NICU nurses and 57 physicians and asked 214 parents about their
   relationships with staff. The outcome variables of 230 premature infants
   with birth weights of less than 1500g were collected over a period of
   18months. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analyses
   for statistical purposes.
   ResultsWe found differences in outcome measures between the NICUs,
   particularly parameters of respiratory support, weight gain and length
   of stay. When we controlled for the NICUs' baseline factors, perceptions
   of the relationship between staff and parents (empathy, p<0.001;
   conversation duration and frequency, p<0.05; familiarity, p<0.05) and
   staff work characteristics (workload, p<0.05) were associated with at
   least one of these outcome measures.
   ConclusionStaff and parents were discriminators for neonatal outcomes
   through perceptions of work characteristics and the relationship between
   staff and parents, respectively. Respiratory support and nutrition
   measures were particularly sensitive. This research has prompted a
   nationwide, multicentre study of 66 NICUs.}},

Title = {{Shame, guilt, and the medical learner: ignored connections and why we
   should care}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{ContextShame and guilt are subjective emotional responses that occur in
   response to negative events such as the making of mistakes or an
   experience of mistreatment, and have been studied extensively in the
   field of psychology. Despite their potentially damaging effects and
   ubiquitous presence in everyday life, very little has been written about
   the impact of shame and guilt in medical education.
   MethodsThe authors reference the psychology literature to define shame
   and guilt and then focus on one area in medical education in which they
   manifest: the response of the learner and teacher to medical errors.
   Evidence is provided from the psychology literature to show associations
   between shame and negative coping mechanisms, decreased empathy and
   impaired self-forgiveness following a transgression. The authors link
   this evidence to existing findings in the medical literature that may be
   related to unrecognised shame and guilt, and propose novel ways of
   thinking about a learner's ability to cope, remain empathetic and
   forgive him or herself following an error.
   ResultsThe authors combine the discussion of shame, guilt and learner
   error with findings from the medical education literature and outline
   three specific ways in which teachers might lead learners to a
   shame-free response to errors: by acknowledging the presence of shame
   and guilt in the learner; by avoiding humiliation, and by leveraging
   effective feedback.
   ConclusionsThe authors conclude with recommendations for research on
   shame and guilt and their influence on the experience of the medical
   learner. This critical research plus enhanced recognition of shame and
   guilt will allow teachers and institutions to further cultivate the
   engaged, empathetic and shame-resilient learners they strive to create.

Title = {{Residents' Engagement and Empathy Associated With Their Perception of

Journal = {{WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY}},

Abstract = {{Faculty members rely on residents' feedback about their teaching
   performance. The influence of residents' characteristics on evaluations
   of faculty is relatively unexplored. We aimed to evaluate the levels of
   work engagement and empathy among residents and the association of both
   characteristics with their evaluation of the faculty's teaching
   performance.
   A multicenter questionnaire study among 271 surgery and gynecology
   residents was performed from September 2012 to February 2013. Residents'
   ratings of the faculty's teaching performance were collected using the
   system for evaluation of teaching quality (SETQ). Residents were also
   invited to fill out standardized measures of work engagement and empathy
   using the short Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and the Jefferson Scale of
   Physician Empathy, respectively. Linear regression analysis using
   generalized estimating equations to evaluate the association of
   residents' engagement and empathy with residents' evaluations of
   teaching performance.
   Overall, 204 (75.3 \%) residents completed 1814 SETQ evaluations of 302
   faculty, and 143 (52.8 \%) and 140 (51.7 \%) residents, respectively,
   completed the engagement and empathy measurements. The median scores of
   residents' engagement and empathy were 4.56 (scale 0-6) and 5.55 (scale
   1-7), respectively. Higher levels of residents' engagement (regression
   coefficient b = 0.128; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.072-0.184; p <
   0.001) and empathy (b = 0.113; 95 \% CI 0.063-0.164; p < 0.001) were
   associated with higher faculty teaching performance scores.
   Residents' engagement and empathy appear to be positively associated
   with their evaluation of the faculty's performance. A possible
   explanation is that residents who are more engaged and can understand
   and share others' perspectives stimulate and experience faculty's
   teaching better than others.}},

Title = {{Interventions to cultivate physician empathy: a systematic review}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physician empathy is both theoretically and empirically
   critical to patient health, but research indicates that empathy declines
   throughout medical school and is lower than ideal among physicians. In
   this paper, we synthesize the published literature regarding
   interventions that were quantitatively evaluated to detect changes in
   empathy among medical students, residents, fellows and physicians.
   Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and
   PsychINFO in June of 2014 to identify articles that quantitatively
   assessed changes in empathy due to interventions among medical students,
   residents, fellows and physicians.
   Results: Of the 1,415 articles identified, 64 met inclusion criteria. We
   qualitatively synthesized the findings of qualified studies by
   extracting data for ten study metrics: 1) source population, 2) sample
   size, 3) control group, 4) random assignment, 5) intervention type, 6)
   intervention duration, 7) assessment strategy, 8) type of outcome
   measure, 9) outcome assessment time frame, and 10) whether a
   statistically significant increase in empathy was reported. Overall, the
   64 included studies were characterized by relatively poor research
   designs, insufficient reporting of intervention procedures, low
   incidence of patient-report empathy assessment measures, and inadequate
   evaluations of long-term efficacy. 8 of 10 studies with highly rigorous
   designs, however, found that targeted interventions did increase
   empathy.
   Conclusions: Physician empathy appears to be an important aspect of
   patient and physician well-being. Although the current empathy
   intervention literature is limited by a variety of methodological
   weaknesses, a sample of high-quality study designs provides initial
   support for the notion that physician empathy can be enhanced through
   interventions. Future research should strive to increase the sample of
   high-quality designs through more randomized, controlled studies with
   valid measures, explicit reporting of intervention strategies and
   procedures, and long-term efficacy assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To describe the process aspects (communication) of the
   information expectations of clients accessing oncology care services at
   a tertiary referral center for dogs with life-limiting cancer.
   Design-Qualitative analysis of data acquired during in-person single and
   dyadic interviews.
   Sample-43 dog owners participating in 30 interviews.
   Procedures-Independent in-person interviews were conducted with
   standardized open- and closed-ended questions from April to October
   2009. Thematic analysis was performed on transcripts of the interview
   discussions.
   Results-The participants expected information to be communicated in a
   forthright manner; in multiple formats; with understandable language; in
   an unrushed environment wherein staff took the time to listen, answer
   all questions, and repeat information when necessary; on a continuous
   basis, with 24-hour access to address questions or concerns; in a timely
   manner; with positivity; with compassion and empathy; with a
   nonjudgmental attitude; and through staff with whom they had established
   relationships.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that the manner in
   which information is communicated is vitally important to clients of
   dogs with life-limiting cancer in that it not only facilitates
   comprehension but also creates a humanistic environment from which
   clients derive the psychosocial support needed to successfully cope with
   their pet's condition.}},

Abstract = {{Background. As organ transplantation has become a more routine medical
   procedure, there has been a growing interest in studying people's
   attitudes and knowledge concerning organ donation. Trait empathy and
   self-interest influence different pro-social behaviors to a great
   extent; still, their role in the promotion of organ donation
   registration and willingness to donate organs remains unclear. However,
   people with higher levels of empathy report more altruistic beliefs. We
   assessed the influence of empathy, beliefs, and demographic variables on
   willingness to donate organs.
   Methods. We included 191 subjects (135 female, 56 male) aged 16-61 years
   (mean, 26.86 +/- 12.88), who participated in educational meetings
   concerning organ donation. The group was composed of students, teachers,
   and nurses. Survey tools included the Individual Questionnaire: Study of
   Attitudes Towards Transplantation, consisting of 26 closed-ended
   questions (with the consent of the Krakow Statistical Office) and the
   Empathy Scale by Mehrabian and Epstein.
   Results. Of the respondents, 97.4\% accept transplantation from living
   donors, 95.8\% accept deceased donations, and 78.5\% agree with
   posthumous life-saving organ donation. The majority of respondents
   (73\%) achieved an average level of empathy, and 20.4\% of respondents
   exhibited considerably higher empathy levels. There was a significant
   difference between the respondents' sex and their agreement to make a
   life-saving organ donation. Differences were found among the groups, the
   attitudes and willingness to donate organs, and between the level of
   empathy and agreement/consent for organ donation.
   Conclusions. Our findings show that the group in general has favorable
   beliefs about transplantation and declares a willingness to make a
   posthumous organ donation. These beliefs vary based on demographic
   variables. Education about organ and tissue donation a has a positive
   impact on donation and transplantation rates.}},

Abstract = {{The process of medical mediation involves the reconstruction of
   doctor-patient relationships through sharing mutual truthful information
   and encouraging dialogue between doctors and their patients. This study
   was designed to examine the effects of disclosing the avoidable as well
   as unavoidable causes of doctors' behavior following malpractice or
   perceived inconsiderate behavior on patients' feelings in medical
   mediation. An avoidable cause was defined as doctor's behavior that was
   incautious or showed insufficient empathy. An unavoidable one, however,
   was defined as any cause other than doctors' behavior. A questionnaire
   was administered to 385 Japanese hospital outpatients, in which
   participants were presented a range of scenarios with the above two
   causes for doctor's behavior or an adverse event. Participants' feelings
   toward the doctor in each scenario were measured on a seven-point scale
   following disclosure of each cause. The five scenarios provoking
   negative feelings toward doctors involved ``(the patient) being
   ignored,{''} ``refusal of a request,{''} ``dominating behavior,{''} ``a
   minor incident,{''} and ``an adverse event.{''} The valid response rate
   was 62.9\% (242/385). Negative feelings were evoked in all five
   scenarios. After disclosure of avoidable causes, scores for negative
   feelings significantly increased between 3\% and 33\%. In contrast,
   after disclosure of unavoidable causes, scores for negative feelings
   significantly decreased between 11\% and 43\%. These findings imply that
   disclosure of causal information in medical mediation will provide the
   opportunity to reevaluate unexpected doctors' behavior and change
   patients' negative feelings. Therefore, disclosures should be made in
   the case of not only unavoidable causes but also avoidable ones.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine how certain characteristics of film-presented
   practitioner role-models influence trainees' mentalization.
   Methods: In an experimental setting, psychology students watched four
   film clips presenting a patient-practitioner session; the clips varied
   in the practitioner's patient-centeredness (positive vs. negative) and
   gender. Participants commented on the practitioner's thoughts, emotions
   and intentions through the session. Analysis of 116 comments focused on
   the effect of patient-centeredness and gender variables on mentalization
   and judgment utterances.
   Results: Negative role-models and female role-models induced higher
   levels of mentalization compared to positive and male role-models. There
   was no gender difference in the level of mentalization; however male
   participants gave more judgmental responses than female participants.
   The patient-centeredness had a larger effect on mentalization when
   trainees described the opposite gender role-model.
   Conclusion: In a systematic comparison, students' capacity for
   mentalization differed according to role-models' patient-centeredness
   and gender, as well as the gender-match of students with role-models.
   Practice implications: When working with film-presented role-models,
   educators should be aware of the differences in the level of
   mentalization elicited by positive and male role-models, as opposed to
   negative and female role-models. Educators should also consider the
   gender-match between trainees and role-models, therefore students should
   be exposed to both cross- and same-gender role-models. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background Educators are concerned by the high prevalence of emotional
   distress among medical students, and by the alleged decline in their
   humanitarian values. Objective To re-examine these concerns by reviewing
   studies of medical students' wellbeing and development. Method Narrative
   review of the literature. Main findings (a) Medical students' emotional
   distress increases during their undergraduate training. However,
   although higher than in the general population, the prevalence of
   distress among medical students is similar to that among other
   university students. (b) Medical students' distress is independently
   related to endogenous factors (personality traits and life events) and
   to their perception of the medical learning environment. (c) Medical
   students do not display a measurable increase in moral reasoning,
   empathy and tolerance of uncertainty. (d) Students' wellbeing, moral
   development, reflectivity and tolerance of uncertainty have been shown
   to be interrelated, and associated with clinical performance.
   Conclusions The findings of this review endorse the concerns about the
   wellbeing and development of undergraduate medical students. The design
   of the reviewed studies does not permit inferences about causality. Yet,
   these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that medical training
   causes emotional distress that delays students' development and affects
   their clinical performance.}},

Title = {{Examiner and simulated patient ratings of empathy in medical student
   final year clinical examination: are they useful?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many medical schools state that empathy is important and
   have curricular learning outcomes covering its teaching. It is thought
   to be useful in team-working, good bedside manner, patient perspective
   taking, and improved patient care. Given this, one might expect it to be
   measured in assessment processes. Despite this, there is relatively
   little literature exploring how measures of empathy in final clinical
   examinations in medical school map onto other examination scores. Little
   is known about simulated patient (actors) rating of empathy in
   examinations in terms of inter-rater reliability compared with clinical
   assessors or correlation with overall examination results.
   Methods: Examiners in final year clinical assessments in one UK medical
   school rated 133 students on five constructs in Objective Structured
   Long Examination Record (OSLER) with real patients: gathering
   information, physical examination, problem solving, managing the
   diagnosis, and relationship with the patient. Scores were based on a
   standardized well-established penalty point system. In separate
   Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) stations, different
   examiners used the same penalty point system to score performance in
   both interactional and procedural stations. In the four
   interaction-based OSCE stations, examiners and simulated patient actors
   also independently rated empathy of the students.
   Results: The OSLER score, based on penalty points, had a correlation of
   -0.38 with independent ratings of empathy from the interactional OSCE
   stations. The intra-class correlation (a measure of inter-rater
   reliability) between the observing clinical tutor and ratings from
   simulated patients was 0.645 with very similar means. There was a
   significant difference between the empathy scores of the 94 students
   passing the first part of the sequential examination, based on combined
   OSCE and OSLER scores (which did not include the empathy scores), and 39
   students with sufficient penalty points to trigger attendance for the
   second part (Cohen's d = 0.81).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that empathy ratings are related to
   clinical performance as measured by independent examiners. Simulated
   patient actors are able to give clinically meaningful assessment scores.
   This gives preliminary evidence that such empathy ratings could be
   useful for formative learning, and bolsters the call for more research
   to test whether they are robust enough to be used summatively.}},

Title = {{The effect of medical students' gender, ethnicity and attitude towards
   poetry-reading on the evaluation of a required, clinically-integrated
   poetry-based educational intervention}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Art-based interventions are widely used in medical
   education. However, data on the potential effects of art-based
   interventions on medical students have been limited to small qualitative
   studies on students' evaluation of elective programs, and thus their
   findings may be difficult to generalize. The goal of this study is to
   examine, in an unselected students' population, the effect of students'
   gender, ethnicity and attitude towards poetry on their evaluation of a
   clinically-integrated poetry-based educational intervention.
   Methods: A required Clinically-Oriented Poetry-reading Experience (COPE)
   is integrated into the 4th year internal medicine clerkship. We
   constructed a questionnaire regarding the program's effects on students.
   Students completed the questionnaire at the end of the clerkship. We
   performed a Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and examined the relationship
   between students' evaluation of the program and students' ethnicity,
   gender, attitude towards poetry-reading, and the timing of the program
   (early/late) during the fourth year.
   Results: 144 students participated in the program, of which 112
   completed the questionnaires. We identified two effect factors:
   ``student-patient{''} and ``self and colleagues{''}. The average score
   for ``student-patient{''} factor was significantly higher as compared to
   the ``self and colleagues{''} factor. Evaluation the
   ``student-patient{''} effect factor was higher among Arab and Druze as
   compared to Jewish students. Students' attitude towards poetry-reading
   did not correlate with the ``student-patient{''} effect, but correlated
   with the ``self and colleagues{''} effect. The evaluation of the ``self
   and colleagues{''} effect was higher among students who participated in
   the program during their second as compared with the first clerkship.
   Students' gender was not associated with any of the effects identified.
   Students favored obligatory participation in COPE as compared with
   elective course format.
   Conclusions: According to students' evaluation, a format of integrated,
   obligatory poetry-based intervention may be suitable for enhancing
   ``student-patient{''} aims in heterogeneous student populations. The
   higher evaluation of the ``patient-student{''} effect among Arab and
   Druze as compared to Jewish students may be related to cultural
   differences in the perception of this component of medical
   professionalism. Further research can provide insight into the effect of
   cultural and ethnic differences on actual empathy of medical students in
   patient encounters.}},

   Judgments in a Disability Determination Context for Low Back Pain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{915-924}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Accountability has been shown to affect clinical judgments among health
   care providers in several ways. It may increase a provider's motivation
   for accuracy, leading to more deliberative judgments, or it may enhance
   biases that evaluators consistently demonstrate with patients with
   chronic pain. In this study, medical students read a vignette about a
   hypothetical patient referred for evaluation of severe low back pain by
   the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation. Accountability to the patient
   was either weak (consultative 1-time evaluation) or strong (ongoing
   primary care provision); societal accountability was either weak
   (evaluation information as secondary source for disability
   determination) or strong (evaluation information primary to disability
   determination). Participants then made judgments regarding validity of
   the patient's presentation, influence of psychosocial factors on the
   presentation, and patient's level of pain, distress, and disability, and
   completed an empathy measure. Results showed that empathy had strong
   associations with symptom validity and severity judgments. With empathy
   as a covariate, 3 crossover interactions emerged. Judgments of symptom
   validity were lower when the 2 forms of accountability were inconsistent
   (ie, one weak and the other strong) than when they were consistent (ie,
   both weak or both strong). Likewise, judgments of psychosocial factors
   and pain/distress/disability were higher under consistent accountability
   conditions than when accountability conditions were inconsistent. This
   pattern may imply conflict avoidance or self-protection as a motivation
   for judgments under inconsistent accountability. This study demonstrated
   that role demands can affect symptom judgments in complex ways, and that
   empathy may play both direct and moderating roles. Because physicians
   are the primary gatekeepers regarding disability determination in both
   consultative and treating roles, accountability may have significant
   mediating effects on such determinations.
   Perspective: This study demonstrated that medical student judgments of
   pain-related symptoms were strongly associated with their levels of
   empathic concern. Student judgments of symptom validity and psychosocial
   influences on patient adjustment were differentially affected by their
   level of accountability to the patient and society in a disability

Title = {{The Bridge Between Real and Ideal: Students Perception on Quality Gap in
   Reality and Their Educational Expectations}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies in higher education indicated that students'
   expectation for their educational services are not provided
   sufficiently, particularly in developing countries that implies on gap
   between the students perception on current situation and their
   expectations from educational services.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the gap between
   student perception and expectations of students in various levels of the
   undergraduate educational courses at Urmia University of Medical
   Sciences, Iran.
   Patients and Methods: This is a longitudinal study, which was conducted
   in academic year 2007-2008 at the Urmia University of Medical Sciences.
   In total, 173 students were selected as sample size, among various
   courses. SERVQUAL questionnaire was used as instrument. Descriptive
   statistics following by Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used to
   determining significance of quality gap between five dimensions and to
   evaluate significant gap between student perceptions and their
   expectations, respectively. Spearman test was also used to determine the
   relationship between dimensions.
   Results: In overall, 80\% of educational expectations were not meet;
   there was a negative gap at all phrases and dimensions and the gap was
   more negative for educational experts (-1.45 +/- 0.89) compared to
   teachers (-0.97 +/- 0.97). The highest gap for teachers was in empathy
   dimension (-1.11 +/- 1.51), while for experts it was in assurance
   dimension (-1.58 +/- 1).
   Conclusions: Existences of gap in dimensions indicated that expectations
   of students are not met and it indicates their dissatisfaction, and thus
   it is a necessity for improvement in all dimensions.}},

Title = {{Telemedicine as an ethics teaching tool for medical students within the

Abstract = {{A novel patient-centered approach was used to deliver ethics curriculum
   to medical students. Two medical school clinicians designed a
   telemedicine session linking their facilities (across 2 continents). The
   session, Exploring the Patient Experience Through Telemedicine: Dialysis
   and End-Stage Renal Disease, allowed second-year medical students to
   explore various parameters of quality of life experienced by dialysis
   patients. A panel of 4 medical students interviewed a dialysis patient
   via Skype video connection between the medical school and the hospital's
   dialysis unit. Interview questions were adapted from the Kidney Disease
   Quality of Life instrument. During the live video-streamed interview,
   the remaining 23 second-year medical students observed the session.
   Afterward, the 23 were offered a voluntary anonymous online feedback
   survey (15 responded). The 4 panelists submitted narrative responses to
   2 open-ended questions about their experience. All 15 responding
   students ``Strongly agreed{''} or ``Agreed{''} that the session was an
   aid to their professionalism skills and behaviors; 14 of 15 ``Strongly
   agreed{''} or ``Agreed{''} that telemedicine technology contributed to
   their understanding of the topic; 12 of 15 ``Strongly agreed{''} that
   the session improved their understanding of the psychosocial burdens of
   dialysis, quality of life, and human suffering, and increased their
   empathy toward patients; and 12 of 15 ``Strongly agreed{''} or
   ``Agreed{''} that the session encouraged reflective thinking and was an
   aid to improving their communication skills. Telemedicine can be an
   effective and feasible method to deliver an ethics curriculum with a
   patient-centered approach. Additionally, the cross-cultural experience
   exposes students to additional contextual features of medicine. (C) 2014

Title = {{New Insight into the Role of Patients During Medical Appointments: A
   Synthesis of Three Qualitative Studies}},
Journal = {{PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{313-318}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background The complexity of the doctor-patient relationship requires
   in-depth research to enable a better understanding of the nature of the
   doctor's appointment.
   Objective To explore how patients can facilitate their medical
   appointments, and how they can be responsible for their relationship
   with their doctors.
   Methods A synthesis of our previous three qualitative studies of
   doctor-patient relationships focussed on the consultations. The analysis
   involved three qualitative studies based on in-depth interviews with 94
   patients of family doctors in Poland.
   Results A detailed analysis of these data allowed us to distinguish
   several different ways in which patients participate in medical
   consultation, namely: 1. facilitating the visit; 2. having an impact on
   both patient and doctor perception of satisfaction with the visit; and
   3. showing concern for the doctor, understanding the doctor's situation
   and having empathy.
   Conclusion This study concerning patient-doctor interactions shows that
   each participant can explicitly provide emotional support for the other,
   despite the evident asymmetry in the roles of doctor and patient.
   Patients can substantially contribute to the personalisation of their
   relationship with the doctor, which is often facilitated by the
   repetition and regularity of the interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies suggest that veterinary students' empathy for animals
   declines during the years spent at university yet the factors
   responsible for this change are not well understood. This study focused
   on the influence of workplace learning (WPL) on veterinary students'
   empathy for animals. WPL comprises off-campus placements and is common
   to all veterinary degree programs. A survey of 150 veterinary students
   at Charles Sturt University was conducted using an established
   animal-empathy scale. In general, our findings supported previous
   studies that empathy for animals declines between the first and fifth
   year and is lower in male students than in female students. Our findings
   indicated that specific factors relating to WPL such as pre-clinical
   extramural studies and clinical placements significantly influenced the
   students' beliefs on animal welfare. The findings presented here suggest
   that closer examination of the impact of WPL within the veterinary
   curricula is important to understanding students' changes in empathy for
   animals and the development of ethical principles in veterinary
   education.}},
